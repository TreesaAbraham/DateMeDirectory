Hi! 👋 ![|float-right h-96 rounded-xl m-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haglobah/public_pictures/main/beat.jpg)
I&#39;m Beat – it&#39;s nice to meet you!

I just started working as a Software Architect at a small software consultancy (and I&#39;m really enjoying it!). Before that, I did a [orientational study year](https://uni-tuebingen.de/einrichtungen/verwaltung/stabsstellen/leibniz-kolleg/das-leibniz-kolleg/), [studied physics](https://www.phys.ethz.ch/studies/bachelor.html) for 3 semesters, and then went to a [programming school](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/).

I care about a lot of things, but these feel the most fundamental to who I am:
- working on creating a good/better future for all of us
- personal growth/learning
- deep connections with kind people

## More about me
**I care deeply about making the world a better place and living in alignment with my values.**
I find the amount to which our broken systems hurt people very upsetting, and I want to help as much as I can.
Thinking about how we fix this mess we&#39;re in is what my brain does naturally—and yep, we still got a lot to do :)

Problems that involve systems and high-uncertainty problems fascinate me (and are those most in need of solving), which is probably why I’m a big fan of both Systems Practice and Design Thinking.

**I&#39;m deeply interested in and get excited by a lot of things.**
I geek out about Education, History, Macroeconomics, Organizational Models, Sci-Fi, Distributed Systems, Societies, Startups, Systems Thinking, Learning, Programming Languages, would love to live in a self-sustained community, ... 
So yes, if you&#39;re excited about a topic, I&#39;m absolutely looking forward to you telling me all about it.

I read a lot—you can find some of my favourite books [here](https://zeneca.io/haglobah).

[Lately, I&#39;ve been thinking about](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/smalltalkq) how we can create better Software Systems, [Tools for Thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), and [Intellectual Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property). 

**Learning and Education absolutely excite me.**
Two years ago, I taught a course about learning at a summer school for gifted teenagers, and I&#39;m already planning the next one (about a different topic, ofc!)
- By the way: What would an ideal education system look like? What skills would it teach, would there be teachers, where does the learning happen? Such an interesting (and far-reaching) question!

I really enjoy being surprised intellectually, and the things that do that best are probably [Paul Graham’s essays](https://paulgraham.com/essay.html), [xkcd](https://xkcd.com)s, or even better, [what if](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/)s.

**I love being in community with people that care.**
One way to tell my life&#39;s story is just by naming the communities I&#39;ve been part of — I just love being in a group where there&#39;s a shared purpose I believe in and kind people working towards fulfilling it:
- Creating a great place to just be at the [Spatzennest Tübingen](https://www.spatzennest-tuebingen.de/)
- Learning and growing together at the [Leibniz Kolleg](https://uni-tuebingen.de/einrichtungen/verwaltung/stabsstellen/leibniz-kolleg/das-leibniz-kolleg/)
- Solving problems with Systems Practice and Design Thinking at [rootlinks](https://www.rootlinks.ch/)
- Trying to make software suck less at  [active group](https://active-group.de/)

I&#39;m very much looking forward to creating more places like that: My long-term plans/ideas include founding something like an ecovillage community as well as starting a school 😇

The other social thing that energizes me is meeting with friends that pass [The Traffic Test](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner-part-2.html)—there&#39;s little I enjoy more than deep, hour-long interesting conversations with nice people.  

## What my friends say
&gt; I think one of the things I appreciate most about Beat is that he gives me the feeling that I can just be myself whenever I am with him. He is definitely a super-smart high-performer, but if you want to be his friend (or more?), I think you do not have to be like that, and you definitely do not need to read through every one of the two thousand websites linked in this date-me doc. I think what you need is a kind soul, the wish to make the world a better place, and interest in what he is excited about, and  you need to be okay with him being a little socially non-conformist. And what you get is a funny, super-loyal, mega-understanding, ultra-trustworthy, hopefully-for-life, kind-hearted gem of a person.

## What am I looking for in a partner?
I feel very much seen by [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner-part-2.html) and [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/how-to-find-the-one).
Knowing that I won&#39;t be able to communicate their points more clearly than they do, here&#39;s the skimmable version:

**Curiosity and Intellectual excitement**
I think the world&#39;s an absolutely fascinating place, and I&#39;m really enjoying understanding it better with someone else. I&#39;d be very happy to do that with 

**A shared sense of humor**
Well, let&#39;s just say it&#39;d be incredibly sad if we were a great match, but not able to laugh about each others&#39; jokes.

**Excitement to build a family and spending a large part of our time together**
I would love to find a partner who shares my excitement to have kids someday. 

**Clear, open and honest communication + emotional maturity**
I&#39;ve got a lot of value out of learning about nonviolent communication, and generally strive to communicate that way. I am concious about [my boundaries](https://markmanson.net/boundaries), and absolutely committed to grow personally. 

## Important stuff/logistics
- **Location**: I just moved back very consciously to Tübingen, Germany, and I&#39;m really enjoying it! So... you&#39;d need to have very good reasons to get me to move (e.g. a place I might enjoy even more overall). That said, as a software person, I could quite easily work from somewhere else, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m bound to stay here forever.
- **Age**: I&#39;m 25, and open to dating someone between the ages of ~23 and ~30.
- **Relationship Style**: monogamous
- **Kids**: I&#39;m absolutely looking forward to having kids with the right person within the next 3-8 years :)

## Possible &#39;cons&#39;/sources of incompatibility
- I only drink when I feel like it (which was about once a year throughout the last five years), never did any other drugs, and I&#39;m not intending to. 
- I have relatively libertarian and utopian political views (free as in freedom, not as in neoliberalism). I do, however, enjoy little more than a well-thought-through opinion that challenges mine!
- I&#39;m slowly gravitating towards a essentialist/minimalist lifestyle (I try to own progressively less things, try to have a low mental workload, prepare mostly my own food, ...)
- I need a large part of my day just to maintain myself (as in: Doing enough sports &amp; stretching, having my me-time, doing enough mentally demanding things) without getting crazy.

## What could we do together?
- We could cook stuff, play games, go on long walks, watch movies, cuddle, listen to music, read books, visit cities?
- We could do some smaller projects together: Learning a new skill, hosting a meetup/game night/whatever, going on Hackathons, learning a new sport, ...
- We could do big projects together. Founding a school, a community, starting a blog, writing a course or curriculum, writing a book—you name it.
