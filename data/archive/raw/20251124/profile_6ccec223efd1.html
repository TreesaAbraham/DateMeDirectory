  <div class="post-content"><!-- `Last updated: September 19` -->

<p>Hello 👋 I’m Yash. I live in San Francisco, California. Although this page may suggest otherwise, I’m not super tech bro-y. I spend a good amount of time in front of screens, yet I’m quite technologically challenged. This is a running doc on my personality as well as what I’m looking for in a partner.</p>

<p><strong>Preface:</strong> I don’t have a laundry list of filters. I’m not perfect, and I don’t expect my partner to be either. Importantly, I don’t look for finished products.</p>

<h4 id="a-little-about-me">A little about me</h4>

<p>India, 1998. Born to Hindi, forced to English. To echo words of <a href="https://x.com/naval/status/966512979066765313?lang=en">Naval Ravikant</a>, I have a calm mind, am working toward a fit body, and am looking for a house full of love. Strictly monogamous. Have an older sister. Parents back in India.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve moved a lot since covid, almost too much to the point that it’s exhausting to even think about packing suitcases. Grateful for all experiences. I’ve spent my formative years outside India and have been away from home for 12 years. I’m currently a software engineer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m not a transactional person. It irks me when people give depending on what they’ve received in the past, in any relationship, not just romantic ones. I keep my friend circle small, and I’m happy to do things by myself - I don’t want superficial connections. I am routinely alone, and I’m generally secure about this, although I have some off days too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t like labels because I believe everyone’s on some sort of spectrum. I don’t know my MBTI, but I am more on the introverted side. It takes me a bit to open up and be vulnerable. I am obviously batshit crazy and act possessed around people I trust.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I grew up as a vegetarian. In meats, I only eat chicken (and sometimes salmon). I don’t care if you eat/cook whatever, but of course it would be lovely to be able to share most of our meals. I also love cooking for others when I’m in the mood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Homebody at heart but try my best to not miss a sunny day. Like to try any and all sports.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>North star:</strong> I want to be proud of myself when I’m 80. Actively working on being more present. At any given moment, I’m usually chipping away at my doc on life goals. Mostly just vibing though.</p>

<h4 id="what-im-looking-for">What I’m looking for</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Someone who hyperfixates on the positives. Spending years together is not going to be easy if we can’t look past the trivial/unimportant. I default to seeing the good in people way before their flaws, and I’d like to be with someone who leans the same way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patience. One of my favorite quotes from A Gentleman in Moscow:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration – and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In for the long haul and I’m happy to take things slowly. That said, patience also doesn’t mean bottling up feelings until a vague notion of “enough time” has passed. If I like you, I’ll try my best to communicate it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Non-judgemental. My best friendships are with people who are kind in their hearts and deeply care about understanding each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A partnership full of growth. Someone who supports the other person thru the ups and downs, someone soft and candid. We laugh easily and tease each other. Good chemistry and intimacy. No topic is off the table and no walking on egg shells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If</strong> you’re Indian, I’d love to be able to speak Hindi with you, although it’s not a must-have. I am also typically more attracted to Indians who grew up in India - easier to connect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A beautiful smile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-i-dont-want-">What I don’t want 🚩</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you play games (think tiktoks on loyalty tests etc). No time for those. If I can avoid it, I don’t want anyone to have to second-guess what I’m thinking or wait ages for a response from me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you treat me like an option, I’m out. I naturally focus on one person at a time, even early on. It’s ok if you aren’t the same (you’re a queen - I’m sure you have options), but after a few dates, I expect honesty about whether you see something here. Please don’t keep me around as a backup - be kind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political activist. I don’t want to talk politics day in day out. To me, politics is mentally and emotional draining with no clear benefit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drugs or substance addiction. I drink occasionally and I don’t smoke. I strongly prefer non-smokers, but I’m ok as long as you don’t stink and are healthy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>-</p>

<p>If you made it this far, thank you :) Again, anything mentioned above is a nice-to-have. I am hopelessly optimistic in people, for better or for worse. I know it can be scary to reach out, but I promise I’ll be nice to you. Please email me at <strong>yashmittal2009 [at] gmail [dot] com</strong>.</p>
