	<h2>What I Want</h2>
	
	<p>I’m attempting to live with an <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1364023511983923202.html">open heart</a>, robust ethics, and scrupulous epistemic standards. 

	<p>I want relationships, romantic or platonic, that are about helping me become wiser, more competent, and more ethical, and/or helping people who I like and respect become better by their own lights.</p>

	<p>My favorite people tend to be extremely hardcore Effective Altruists, monastics that have sworn a vow of service to all life, and highly emotionally-attuned vegan therapists.</p>
	
	<p>I'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>a low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the one hand,</li>
		<li>and a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the other. </li>
		</ul>	

		<h3>Weekly-ish companionship</h3> <!--High intimacy, low commitment companionship-->

		<p>Currently, I’m mainly looking for more companionship in my life.</p>
			
		<p>I would like to have someone to spend time with about once a week: talking, circling, cuddling, having sex, being curious together, all with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other about our desires and our relationship.</p> 
	
		<p>This kind of relationship amounts to approximately what poly people call a "secondary partnership": emotionally intimate, but not the primary structure of one's life. This might work best for someone who already has a primary partner, or who is otherwise committing most of their energies to a high intensity project.</p>
			
		<p>(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyXcXT8yKdkxSxdkc1G4709NFBtfC6WVZym5rdbcS_s/edit?usp=sharing">This somewhat-out-of-date document</a> gives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)</p>
	
	</div>

	<h3>High-intensity Partnership (with a capital P)</h3> <!--Intense partnership-->

	<p>In the long run, I would like to find a <i>spiritual collaborator</i>*, for the other half of an <i>altruistic power couple</i>.</p>
	
	<p>I want a Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom, and who will mutually support me in doing the same. A relationship in which we work together, train together, rest together, and help each other to live in integrity with our values. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time <i>working</i>, and almost no time on conventional leisure activities (like watching movies together or going to parties).

	<p>When I've dated people in the past, I've spent a lot of time and attention trying to <i></i>help them get better</i>. For example, having long conversations (or writing personalized essays) to convey the blindspots I observe in my partner's in-practice philosophy, or working with her to triangulate her skill gaps and to develop practice exercises that address them. Ideally, I'd like a partner who orients towards <i>me</i> and and <i>my</i> weaknesses in a similar way—actively looking out for the things that I'm missing, then helping me to see them, understand them, and improve them—with skill and compassion.</p>

	<p>I have been seeking something like this since I was 15. It’s one one of the desires that I hold closest to my heart. But, at this point, I’m mostly not expecting to find/develop this kind of Partnership, at least before the singularity. Currently, I am constructing a life in which I can learn, and get better, and execute effectively, without the support of a life partnership. But at the same time, I'm <i>also</i> keeping out feelers in case an extremely compatible woman, who is also living this kind of life, crosses my path.</p> 

	<p>(Some more operationalization of what this kind of relationship might look like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.)</p>

	<div>
	<p class="footnote">* - To be clear, I am an atheist and an antitheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god">beyond the reach of God</a>. But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.</p>

<h2>The life I'm living</h2>

<!-- <p>I live an intense, pseudo-ascetic, life, focused on altruistic work, self-improvement, spiritual integrity.
</p> -->

<p>I’m often happiest when I’m working, and when my life is going well, I work a lot. Most days, I’m working, or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctnO9pwF7Ti7AjyYGoSiiTzAHidUZn-mZ4EvwHqPl9M/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.i24l245gvr44">explicitly resting</a>, from 30 minutes after waking up to shortly before sleep (with a daily break for intense exercise). I structure my day to maximize my <a href="https://github.com/Etyre/Methodology-documents/blob/main/Energy%20and%20Intentionality%20Modulation.md">energetic amplitude</a>, so that to a first approximation, I’m either intensely alert and focused, or napping, but rarely in a middling state. I aggressively optimize for <a href="elityre.com/sleep-policies.html">excellent sleep</a>.</p>
</p>

<p>I very rarely socialize outside of work. When I see my friends, it's almost always for one of us to help the other think through a personal problem. I eat one meal a day (most frequently kale, sauteed in olive oil, with toasted tofu). I only very occasionally watch movies or TV, and generally set myself up to <a href="elityre.com/passive-consumption-policy.html">avoid passively consuming content</a> (eg I write at least one sentence about every piece I read).</p>

<p>Outside of my core altruistic projects, I spend time <a>exercising</a>, reading (mostly AI stuff, history books, sometimes textbooks), writing <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/">blog posts</a>, and sometimes hacking on <a href="elityre.com/custom-software.html">small software projects</a>. On the scale of months, I’m often doing some progression of <a>deliberate self-development</a>: identifying a pressing skill gap, and then iteratively designing and doing exercises to develop the relevant subskills. I review anki most days.
	<!--On some weekends I teach rationality and personal development <a>workshops</a>. </p> -->

<p>Most weeks, I take off <a href="https://wild-quit-ebe.notion.site/Notes-on-rest-days-0415bdc2c6d748f190ba21481acc2a3c">one day</a> (and one evening) to rest, decompress, and do whatever feels most nourishing. Some rest day activities include: journaling, reading, writing, strength training, cleaning up my room, singing and memorizing folk songs (while walking around the neighborhood), going to the dog park to spend time with the dogs, meditating. When I’ve had a partner, I’ve enjoyed cuddling with her.</p>

<p>When I have the capacity to take time off from work, I like doing doing various kinds of workshops and trainings, especially those that give me experience with interesting psychological states or faculties: <a href="https://www.jhourney.io/">meditation</a>, <a href="https://www.keithjohnstone.com/home">improv</a>, <a href="https://www.coretransformation.org/">therapy techniques</a>, etc. (I don't do drugs, though.)</p>

<p>(Additional detail on my weird, intense, lifestyle can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LRc22DoIj1NXCDyK02x4Aaa5-Ddg0Bk6_xwuAfz9X6c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.uzfwmjb33czm">here</a>.)</p>

<!--<p>I am looking for someone who is enthusiastic about participating in this kind of life in some way: who is either living similiarly herself or who is ok with having an emotionally intimate relationship in which we see each other only for a few hours a week on (mostly) my rest days.</p>

<p>And more broadly, I’m looking for someone who helps me feel more like myself: more connected with my desire to help, more connected to my drive to become better than I am, and more in touch with beauty and aliveness.</p>-->

	
	<!--<p>In practice, this mostly entails hanging out a few times a week in the afternoon / early evening (in between my main work periods) to go on a walk or a hike, or coworking on tasks together in the evening to midnight. </p>-->

	<!-- <p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm glad to go on casual dates with anyone who thinks "sharing something one of us learned recently" or "trying to puzzle something out together" is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of long term relationship.</p> -->
	
	<!-- <p><b>Update as of February, 2024:</b> I'm still open to both of these kinds of relationships. However, I'm currently more inclined to focus on building my own life without weaving it deeply with another person, and am most interested in the lower intensity companionship, for the time being. You should still contact me if you're interested in either. </p> -->

	<!--<h4>What Dating Me Is Like</h4>-->
	
	<!-- <h4>Dates</h4>
	
	<p>Here are some activities that are my idea of a "good date". You don't have to be into all of these, just one of them.<p>
	
    <ul>
	<li>The uncomplicated default: We go on a walk (maybe into the hills, if we're in Berkeley) and talk, about life, about the world, about what we've each been pondering lately, about who and where we are and how we got there.</li>
	    <li>We meet up and <a href="https://circlinginstitute.com/what-is-circling-method/">Circle</a> together. If you're new to Circling, but interested, then we could do a similar, but more structured, Authentic Relating exercise, instead.</li>
    <!--<li> We try to make progress on some problem of yours. I listen, and try to help you solve it. Or, if there's something that you're trying to do or learn, and I try to help you get unstuck.</li> -->
    <!-- <li>We spend a half day trying to get a grip on something neither of us know anything about. (ie How do mitochondria work? How do you build a computer from logic gates? What's the deal with Modern Monetary Theory? How does the math of predictive processing work?) <!--A more extensive list of open questions is here--></li>
    <!-- <li>We go to some public place, like an airport, or a mall, or a zoo, and people-watch, comparing notes about what we observe and infer. Then we go and check our guesses"check our guesses" should be a link to some page that I've written about the importance of feedback, by talking with those people. --> 
	    <!--<li>We play around with some kind of new-to-us skill or modality (eg things like fermi estimates, or IFS, or vibe-reading, if any of those were new to me), and tinker to try and find functional-for-each-of-us versions.</li>-->
	    
	    <!--<li>We make the world better somehow. When I was yonger, I had a policy of always going volunteering for first dates. But -->
	    
	  <!-- </ul> -->
	    
	    <!-- <p>If there's some other activity which seems good to do together, suggest it! I'm generally up for trying things other than psychoactive substances.</p> --> 
	
	<h2>Constraints and relationship-essentials</h2>

	<h3>Work</h3>

	<!-- <p>I am highly committed to my work. 

	<p>According to my map which is not the territory, I'm likely a member of the last human generation. I think there's a sizable chance that I will die, and the human story will end, between now and 2040, because of AI stuff. 
		If there's not much time left, I want to live a beautiful life. That means, first and foremost, trying everything I can think of that might help save the future, and searching for more ideas to try.</p>  -->

	<!-- I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2023/02/17/my-current-summary-of-the-state-of-ai-risk/">moving in the direction of disaster</a>, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p>  -->

	<!-- <p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p>  -->

	<p>Out of a combination of personal inclination and moral commitment, I work <i></i>a lot</i>. I'm genreally at the office almost all my waking hours, 6 days a week (and usually for a few hours on my rest day, as well).</p> 

	<!--I'm pretty "intense." I rarely socialize outside of work. For fun, I teach personal development workshops, meet with tutors to rapidly learn from their domain of exprteies, read (mostly textbooks, history books, and philosophical essays) always taking notes, write blog posts, and meditate.-->

	<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with me working that, either because you have a similar orientation to the world themselves (maybe we can spend time coworking together?), or because you’re comfortable with a relationship that is emotionally intimate without being time-intensive.</p> 

	<!-- <p class="footnote">* - It also includes striving for a very high standard of integrity, being fastidiously honest, staying fit and healthy, keeping a vegan diet, eating wholesome food with my full attention, being present, living with an open heart, and generally, striving to be the kind of creature robustly makes things better instead of worse.</p> -->
	
</div>

	<h3>Honesty</h3>

	<p>The thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty. </p>

	<p>I've sometimes been in a context where there was a <a href="https://mindingourway.com/steering-towards-forbidden-conversations/">forbidden conversation</a>, some true fact, or some belief I held, that I didn't feel free to acknowledge<!--–because it would offend someone, or because it “wasn’t my place”, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, or because it seemed like it was intruding on the other person, who didn't want to hear it, etc-->. In a situation like this, I feel pressure to pretend about, or distract from, or downplay the thing.</p>

	<p>I’ve come to think that I can’t build a robust relationship on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.</p>

	<p>Creating those kinds of contexts by merely <i>intending to be honest</i> isn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't do undue harm.</p>	

	<p>I make explicit considered effort in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback) in a way that the other party can hear it without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=nonviolent+communication&qid=1627363910&sr=8-1">Nonviolent Communication</a>, <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2019/09/27/basic-double-crux-pattern-example/">rationality</a>, and <a href="https://circlinginstitute.com/what-is-circling-method/">circling</a> skill.</p>

	<p>But even so, I am not a master at this. I still sometimes find myself in situations where there's something that feels too awkward to share even in otherwise candid relationships. I need help to maintain this kind of connection.</p>

	<p>It is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward. This is crucial for me in an intimate relationship.</p>
	

	<!--<p>Maybe you do this in some very different way than I do, but familiarity with Circling and NVC, a developed introspective access, skills related to making space for / owning your triggers, and a basic "desire to relate to what's true", are all good signs.</p>-->

	<h3>Meta</h3>

	<p>Relatedly, relationships with me typically involve a lot of “meta”: doing checkins, talking about the relationship and how it is or isn't working, flagging frictions and generating creative solutions together, investing effort trying to improve our communication processes, etc.</p>

	<p>Some past partners have found this onerous or annoying. “Can’t we skip all the process talk, and just do the cool things that the relationship is about?” I don’t see it that way. Much of what I care about in a relationship is the strength of the relationship itself, and this sort of meta and process-iteration is a means to that.</p>
	
	<p>Completely unironically, leaving comments on my relationship-communication google docs is one of my love languages. (The google doc format is optional. That's just a communication method that has worked well for some past partners.)</p>

	<h3>Relationship style</h3>

	<p>I'm dispositionally monogamous, generally preferring to commit to only one person. However, I am happy to date people who have other partners themselves, especially if I can see that that makes them happy.</p>
		
	<p>I have only ever seriously dated one person at a time, and incidentally, I have only ever seriously dated people who were poly. (Effectively, I was monogamously partnered with someone who was dating other people.)</p>
		
	<p>I am more than willing to participate in a fully-monogamous partnership, if we're a good fit. I've dated poly people, not because I particularly prefer poly, but because the people I've been interested in have been poly.</p>

	<h3>Kids</h3>

	<p>Raising kids appeals to me, but I’m not currently planning around having a family in the pre-singularity. However, I would do that if I found a <i>highly</i> compatible partner and having kids was important to her.</p> 

	<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.</p>

	<!-- <p>However, due to my commitment to my work (which I don't expect to change this decade), we would need to have a frank negotiation about the division of labor in child-rearing, and if the level of support (financial, emotional, labor, etc) I'm able and willing to offer is adequate for raising and educating children.  </p> -->

	<!-- <p>I do have strong views about schooling and education.</p> -->

	<!-- <p>I think that I am unusually committed to the good, which is probably somewhat heritable, and the world would be better if there were more people in it like me. If you wanted my sperm, without parental obligations, I am <em>likely</em> open to that, though I can probably suggest even better candidates.</p> -->

	<p>(I might actively seek out a partner for raising a family after humanity is out of the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/acute-risk-period">acute risk period</a> and life extension is solved.)</p>

	<!--<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p>-->

		<!--<h3>Height</h3> 

		<p>I’m pretty short for an American man (around 5’4”), though I am fit and muscular.</p> 

	<p>Insofar as height is something that my partner might care about, I’m sorry that I can't offer this. I would change it if I could, but tbe relevant biotechnology is not yet advanced enough (and probably won't be in the next 20 years).</p>-->

	<h3>Sex</h3>
	
	<!-- <p>Sex is not a priority for me. I would like to have sex with an intimate partner, but if she doesn't want that or can't, that's not a deal-breaker for me.</p>  -->

	<p>Sex is more important to me in the case of a once-or-twice-a-week companion than in the case of a committed Partnership. The point of having a capital-P partnership is mostly to help each other be better. For that, sex can be nice, but it isn't necessary. In the case of a more casual relationship, sexual and intimate emotional satisfaction is a larger fraction of what I care about.</p>

	<p>I’m interested in doing deliberate practice to get good at sex: focusing on my partner’s experience, with ample verbal and nonverbal feedback (plus after-action debriefs). It would obviously be better to do this with an emotionally-intimate partner, but I'm potentially open to trying with someone who I'm not otherwise dating, if we can establish really good communication and clarity about expectations first.</p>
	
	<!-- <p>(I have inclinations toward sexual dominance, but not particularly towards sexual sadism. I’d be interested in exploring kink or D/s if and only if that sounded exciting to my partner.)</p>
	</p> -->

	<h3>Vegetarianism</h3>

	<p>I'm vegan (with <a href="http://elityre.com/vegan-policy.html">some caveats</a>). So far, 100% of the people that I've dated seriously and 100% of the people that I've ever been in love with have been vegan. This is mostly correlation—the sort of people that I tend to be attracted to tend to be vegans. But it's <em>also</em> causal—I care about the ethics of the people I spend time with. For most people, eating factory farmed meat is the habit that causes the most direct harm to others. (Additionally, seeing someone eat meat tends to reduce my level of attraction for them.)</p>

	<p>I'm not confident, but I think I probably don't want to date people who aren't vegetarian, or who aren't otherwise careful about the externalities their life has on animals in factory farms.</p>

	<p>I'm not listing this as a firm deal-breaker, but it is important to me. If you eat factory farmed meat, and we get moderately far into dating, I'll want to have an honest and reasoned conversation with you about the ethics and tradeoffs involved.</p>

	<p>(I'm conscious that abstaining from animal products entirely is not a healthy choice for some people, and that there are additional tradeoffs.)</p>
	
	<!-- <h2>Some notes about the kind of person I'm looking for</h2>

	<p>I tend to like, and like spending time with, people who embody some combination of unusual moral commitment, high emotional/relational skill, and intellectual aliveness.</p>

	<p>The following are some concrete, non-exhaustive, positive signs (both causal and statistical) that you might be the kind of person that I like. Each of these is a positive sign for me, but that doesn't mean that the absence of any one of them is a negative sign.</p>

	<p>I'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. In <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/timeless-decision-theory">an important way</a>, your 
	doing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you.</p>

	<h2>Aid my quest!</h2>

<p>If you’re not a good match with me (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed, 
	you can help by connecting me with thoughtful single (or non-polysaturated) women who want the sort of thing that I want.<!-- / you think might want to date me--> If you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my <a href="bounties.html">gratitude</a><!--, and, hopefuly, that of the other party as well-->. 

<!--<p>Secondly, you can give me feedback on this page. I've benefited enormously from hearing people's unfiltered reactions to the text here, so that I can iterate to a version that communicates what is important, without cruft. If you're interested in giving me line by line comments of how this lands for you, especially if you're a woman who shares many of my values, I would greatly appreciate it. However, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me 
to tell me that you're interested, instead of just sending me your reactions, since it is less helpful to get feedback while I'm in the revision stage and still incorporating the feedback from the last round.</p>-->

	<h3>What sort of person am I looking for?</h3>
,
<p>This section is all the way down here, at the bottom of the page, because it’s mostly not relevant for people reading to see if they if they might want to go on a date with me. If they feel excited by the sort of interactions that I describe, I don’t want to discourage them because they don’t embody the traits I outline here.</p>

<p>However, for third parties who are hoping to help play match-maker, the above is a bit...abstract.</p>

<p>So the following are some more concrete traits, that empirically, in my life so far, have been predictive of people that I have liked and/or loved. These are not “standards”, in the sense of characteristics that I insist on in a partner, but rather characteristics or traits that are shared by many of the women I most like spending time with.</p>

<p>If you happen to know someone who is well described by the following, you might be doing us both a favor by, introing us, or sending her a link to this page.</p>

	<h4>Empirical predictors of the kinds of people Eli wants to date</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Female, in roughly my age range.</li>
	<li>Unusually ethical. Committed to making the world right, or fair, or good, or much better than it currently is.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The sort of person who, at some point in her life, thought that / planned to give away most of her income to charity.</li>

		<li>Probably vegan or vegetarian.</li>
			
		</ul>

	<li>Works a lot. Is the sort of person who might be described as a workaholic. </li>

	<li>Thoughtful, and puts her thought into practice. [Can I elaborate this? Exmaples would be helpful.</li>

	<li>Intelligent.</li> 
	<ul>
		<li>In particular, possessing impressive verbal fluency. She's self assured and fast on her feet in conversation. </li>
			
		</ul>
		
	<li>Might be described as conventionally "pretty". (I feel a bit embarrased about including this, because it seems like a sad fact about the world that people's non-consensual physicality limits the romantic relationships that they enjoy, but nevertheless, it does seems to be a predictor.)</li>

	<li>Curious about the world.</li>

	<li>An atheist, but also has what might be described as a “spiritual practice” (meditation, introspection, ritual, gratitude practice, a reverence for the sacred, a focus on intentionality, etc.).</li> 

	<li>Of Jewish ancestry.</li>
	
	<li>Doesn't drink (alcohol).</li>
		
	<li>[Both "having good style" and "visibly prioritizing comfort and practicatlity over appearance" have been predictors.]</li> 

	<li>Affable and sociable, though not necessarily extroverted per se. Generally happy.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>To everyone who spends a little bit of time playing match maker, thank you. : )</p>
