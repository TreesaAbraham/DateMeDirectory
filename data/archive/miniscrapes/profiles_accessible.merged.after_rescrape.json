      "fullText": "﻿Bahanur at a glance\r\nWho am I?\r\nI'm a 34-year-old Turkish woman currently based in Malaysia. I work in education and genuinely love what I do. I'm not interested in side hustles, entrepreneurship, or the grind culture that seems to dominate modern dating profiles. My regular schedule and calendar are grounding, they enable me to follow my passion and just be. I've lived across multiple countries in Europe and Asia, and my job gives me geographic flexibility, so I'm genuinely open to relocating for the right person.  \r\nImportant: I don't do magical thinking or use LDR as an excuse to be emotionally avoidant. I'm genuinely looking for a real, committed partnership, and the distance is a practical reality, not a psychological shield. It would be wonderful if you're based in Asia so we could be geographically closer, but I understand that's not always how life works.\r\nMy personality\r\nI'm someone who contains multitudes. I can discuss Chris Marker and memory one moment, then crack jokes about the latest South Park episode the next. I have a deep, contemplative side that loves art, literature, philosophy, and meaningful conversation, but I'm also genuinely funny and don't take myself too seriously. I can laugh at my own absurdities and find humor in life's contradictions. I value authenticity over performance, and I'd rather have one real conversation than a dozen superficial ones.\r\nI'm grounded and present in my daily life. I find joy in simple things like watching birds on my rooftop, good coffee at my favorite café, dancing alone in my apartment, or meaningful conversations with colleagues. I'm independent and self-sufficient. I don't need someone to complete me or fix my life. I'm looking for a partner to share experiences with, not someone to rescue me or be rescued by me. I'm resilient, empathetic, and kind. I show up for people I care about and I expect the same in return. I believe in fighting for what matters and letting go of what doesn't serve me.  \r\nI'm a community-oriented ambivert wherever I live. I enjoy being an engaged member of my surroundings and doing good in the world. You don't need to be as social as I am, but you should appreciate this quality in me.\r\nI've done extensive therapy and personal growth work to overcome a difficult background, and I'm incredibly attracted to people who've done the same. If you've worked through your own challenges with persistence, therapy, and self-reflection, that's deeply appealing to me.\r\nMy daily life & what matters to me\r\nI really care about my daily rhythm and lifestyle. I'm genuinely content with what I have and excited about my life as it is. I love waking up in the morning and I'm grateful for everything I have. I don't need to go to the Bahamas or any other exotic location to have a sense of adventure. For me, adventure can be around the corner in my own neighborhood, and I have plenty of examples to share with people who are interested to listen.\r\nI pay attention to the world around me, and I believe attention is the rarest form of love. I notice the small things, the moments that make life beautiful. This doesn't mean I don't enjoy travel or new experiences, but I don't need constant external stimulation to feel alive.\r\nI exercise regularly and care about eating healthy. I'm interested in exploring vegetarianism, so if you're already vegetarian or also interested in that lifestyle, that would be a wonderful thing to share and explore together.\r\nMy interests & hobbies\r\nI love literature, books, words, and images. I've always been drawn to writing, literature, cinema, and languages. They mean a lot to me. I love taking on projects and learning new things on my own. Currently, I'm working through The Artist's Way and taking a course on The American Novel Since 1945. I've been doing the latter for about half a year now, and I genuinely enjoy this kind of self-directed learning.  \r\nI also love music projects. I took on the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die challenge, and it took me three years to complete. I'll share the link here if you're curious about my musical journey.\r\nMost of my activities require more mental labor than physical labor, though I don't shy away from physical work when needed. I'm drawn to pursuits that engage my mind and creativity (reading, writing, language learning, artistic projects). I'm interested in eventually balancing this with more hands-on activities like gardening or baking, where I can create something tangible and connect with the physical world in a different way. \r\nYou don't have to share all of these interests, but you should understand and respect that reading, learning, and creative work are essential parts of who I am. They're how I process the world, how I grow, and how I find meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\nI'm looking for someone emotionally mature and intelligent who understands what a long-distance relationship actually entails: it requires EXTRA communication and consistency, not less.\r\nMy non-negotiables:\r\n* Childfree: no children for me, but open to dating someone who already has kids and co-parents well\r\n* Emotionally intelligent and self-aware: ideally someone who has done therapy/personal growth work\r\n* Consistent and reliable: someone who follows through on what they say\r\n* Strong communicator: can acknowledge vulnerability, discuss feelings, handle conflict maturely without defensiveness or passive-aggression\r\n* Established and stable: financially responsible, has their own life, interests, and/or friend groups\r\n* No substance abuse issues: occasional social drinking is fine, but no dependency\r\n* Gaming/internet use is recreational, not escapism: I'm grounded in real life and need a partner who is too\r\n* Wants genuine partnership: someone who wants to grow beside me, not someone looking for a parent/therapist/project\r\nAdditional deal-breakers:\r\n* Strictly monogamous (non-negotiable)\r\n* Political values: I'm a leftist, though my views may be quite different from American leftism. I believe in \"live and let live.\"\r\n* Religion: I'm an atheist, but I don't have any problems having a religious partner as long as they don't push their agenda on me. I'm very accepting of other people as long as they're accepting of me.\r\nPartnership to me means two whole people who choose each other and actively work to maintain connection. We have our own hobbies, friends, and interests, but we want to prioritize each other and our relationship. We communicate openly, handle conflicts maturely, and show up consistently even when it's hard.\r\nWhat dating me looks like\r\nI genuinely value consistency and accountability. Love bombing or grand gestures do not work for me. What works is showing up in my life consistently, being respectful of my boundaries and rhythm, and understanding that I respect yours too.  \r\nDaily check-ins are very important to me. They help me feel grounded and avoid triggering old attachment wounds from my past. I don't need long texts, just simple things like \"I saw this and thought of you\" or \"how was your day?\" that put a smile on my face. Weekly deeper connections like video calls or longer voice messages are also important to maintain intimacy and presence. I understand life gets in the way, but consistent effort matters deeply to me.\r\nMy love languages:\r\n* Words of affirmation (primary)\r\n* Quality time (primary)\r\n* Physical touch (primary)\r\n* Acts of service and gift giving are my \"foreign\" love languages. I'm still learning to receive and appreciate them.\r\nWhen I date someone, I don't want to do the heavy lifting. I want it to feel reciprocal, easy, and fun. Feeling at ease with someone and letting things naturally flow is the most important thing for me. I like a slow-burn approach, and since I don't plan to have children, I feel I have all the time in the world for a potential partner and me to see if we really vibe together. I see this as an opportunity to build something real.  \r\nI don't use dating apps. I don't believe in swiping through people like commodities. I prefer slow-burn connections built on genuine compatibility and shared values. I like to move to voice messages or video calls relatively early (not immediately, but once we've established basic compatibility through text) to see if there's natural chemistry and get a feel for each other's energy.\r\nI appreciate people holistically (intellectually, emotionally, physically), and I want someone who sees and values all aspects of who I am, not just one dimension.\r\nImportant notes\r\n* I'm serious about my boundaries and standards. I've learned what I don't want from experience, and I'm not willing to compromise on my core needs.\r\n* If you're interested in reaching out, please write something thoughtful that shows you actually read this document. One-sentence messages will not get replies.\r\nHow to reach me\r\nIf this resonates with you, please email me at: laflaneuse91@gmail.com. In your email, tell me a bit about yourself, what caught your attention in this document, and what you're looking for in a partner. \r\n  P.S.\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this far. I know it's a lot, but if you've made it to the end, it means you're someone who values depth and intentionality, which I really appreciate.\r\nEven if you're not personally interested but know someone who might be a great match for me, feel free to play traditional matchmaker! If you introduce me to someone and we end up being compatible, I'd love to send you a thank-you gift for bringing us together. :)"

      "fullText": "﻿DATE YOU\r\nHey, I'm Ilyaas.\r\nI am 20 years old, 5'9\" or 174 cm looking for a monogamous relationship. I am currently living in Cincinnati, Ohio, but plan on moving to SF/NYC soon.\r\nThis webpage was last updated on: 20 Nov 2025\r\nWho I am:\r\n  \r\n\r\nDating app bio:\r\nTinkerer who writes code, carves wood, bends metal (and reality)\r\nAthlete that throws weights, numbers and you around ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nSecure attachment style\r\nPrimary love languages: Physical Touch, Quality Time, Words of Affirmation.\r\nI can give most love languages liberally. Acts of Service and Gift giving does not come naturally, and will take time to experiment and learn.\r\nFeedback from my last long term relationship:\r\n* Can be rude when stressed or when focused and interrupted (working on this)\r\n* Can hurt without intending to \r\nI want to have kids at some point. Most likely when I am wealthy enough for consumer things to be virtually free and when I can homeschool them myself or pay for schools that make sense, e.g. Alpha School. I will be damned if I am going to teach my kid to ask permission to pee.\r\nI do not believe in god. I was muslim and am now atheist. I get the belief but if your beliefs limit your agency, I am unlikely to make you happy. I will happily tell our children why they should not believe though.\r\nI am a man of routine. I want to be in one place while I build wealth. After that may be a nomadic lifestyle due to my love for mountain biking.\r\nWhy you should not date me:\r\n* I eat clean food (mostly chicken/rice/veggies), rarely eating out (unless on a trip). If you cook me a mean steak, I will not refuse though.\r\n* I train at the gym 5x a week.\r\n* If you do not want to get on creatine and other longevity routines, because I want to live for a long time. If we get together, I would like to have you live with me as long as possible.\r\n* When we fight you will get no space, at least physically, but most likely mentally too. I am much more likely to hold you while you gather yourself than let you walk off. \r\n* Largely traditional values, I think. I am new to the American value system so I may be wrong here.\r\nI am looking for a partner, and the mother of my children. In this, I do not expect you to be a housewife or homemaker because that job can be replaced for 40k USD/year. A mother on the other hand, I can say due to my mother, whose upbringing has contributed to outlier outcomes.\r\nI am looking for someone that believes in me even more than I do, and will be loyal. Someone that wants me to be more of me.\r\nI am currently centering my life on getting smart so I can work on difficult and useful problems and create wealth on the way. The goal for me to have come to the US is to live post-scarcity. Before this, I spent some time in New Zealand because I wanted to be a professional mountain biker. There I discovered that I hate poverty more than I love mountain biking.\r\nI live in ways that make sense to me. For example:\r\n* I sleep on the floor\r\n* I am happy to do dinner dates but will carry my lunchbox with me.\r\n* I recently learned it is polite in the US to wait for your friend to start eating. Why would I do that? Why would I want my friend to be hungrier for longer? Makes 0 sense.\r\nI do have an asian toughness or rashness I would say, and I like that untamed part of me. I have been described as, “the youngest old man I know”, “raw and real”, “annoying, real and loving”, all by different people.\r\nI will most likely go all in soon to try to break things once I am aligned, so in case things don't work out we save the most time and in case we do, I can love you for longer.\r\nCurrently I am solving a problem that involves hardware and prototyping a solution. The market seems to be relatively small but high income. Solutions seem to be DIYed but no official solutions exist yet.\r\nI would love a TVD kind of love but have learned enough to not expect that. What I am looking for now can be accurately summed up in a cofounder for my life and family, possibly business. It could be summed up as the Hormozis, or Courtney and Cbum. As long as I am better with you, I want to be with you, because I want to be better. This could be on the homefront, on the business front, or you could be an artist and have that dynamic. I am open to most things.\r\nI may want to go back to NZ when raising children but that is quite far away.\r\nLife is short, and we will all die. Text me and I’ll take you swing dancing after we walk and talk.\r\nEmail: ilyaasatwork@gmail.com\r\nSignal (preferred): https://signal.me/#eu/8rAMyrw0tr8VHJ_8HmYPrUh09N7NYxlfSBkue8poD9a-b62q3VxLNoOvYpE6Zpyd\r\n\r\nMore pictures below:\r\n________________\r\n        Top left: a photo describing my way of life\r\nTop right: always hungry (for you)\r\nBottom left: deep in thought (maximising shareholder value)\r\nBottom right: mountain biking, my natural habitat"

I’m not looking to\ndate around and figure out what’s right for me at the ripe age of 40.\nI know what I like and what hasn’t worked in the past (although of course I’m always open to being surprised). I’m looking for a man in the same (settling down) life stage who is ready to act decisively and live bigly (\nyes of course I know that’s not a real word\n).\nWhat works for/is attractive to me is likely not what works for/is attractive to most other people. That’s ok; I’m trying to matchmake myself—not play World Yenta™ over here. I am fully (and often painfully) aware that I am an unusual beast and it only makes sense that a reasonable match for me is another unusual beast, and we are hard to find because we’re probably sitting at home alone, thinking about how best to find each other. What a sexless mess.\nA short about me:\nPersonality/Temperament\n• Enneagram 8 -\nThe Challenger\n> seeking similar brute force\n•\nExplorer-Director\n(Helen Fisher) > seeking similar\n•\nOtrovert\n(just learned about this one; explains a lot) > seeking similar\n• Things I learned from a matchmaker about myself:\n- High in dominance and make decisions easily\n- Fully differentiated from my family and do not require their input/approval for decision making\n- Do not require social approval (see otrovert, lol)\n> seeking same\nI hold a lot of opposites (strong, disciplined, organized and love systems but also extremely playful, irreverent, curious, creative, nurturing) and am looking for a partner who has a similar amount of range and flexibility, plus pulls equal weight in the ferocity and leadership departments. I am a physical person and am seeking a similarly physical and vital partner. I do not tend to get along with men who live in their minds or who have a low tolerance for risk. I am here to live a big life and would love the privilege of doing that with a well-matched partner.\n(My and hopefully your) Values\n• Honesty/directness/irreverence\n• Humor/fun/putting yourself out there/social and professional risk\n• Health consciousness (action-based, weight training) without neuroses (perfectionism, body obsession)\n• Connection to nature and animals\n• Physicality and connection to your body, vitality\n• Moderation in all things\n• Curiosity/exploration/growth/self improvement & learning/\nself awareness/accountability\n• Money as freedom—not status\n> similar values desired in a partner\n(My) Hobbies\n• Gardening (flower, vegetable, perennial) and composting\n• Barton Springs\n• The gym (weight training)\n• Writing\n• Being outside (walking, hiking, sitting outside, soccer, frisbee, snowboarding, etc.)\n• Laughing about the insanity of life\n• Hosting/gathering people together\n> some overlap desired in a partner\nQualities I am seeking in a man\n(I definitely stole 5 of these from a book or podcast but can’t remember which so can’t credit)\n• Character (sparkling)\n• Kindness (innate and unprompted)\n• Communication (skillful)\n• Consistency (self explanatory)\n• Commitment (marriage, kids)\n• Confidence (quiet)\n• Courage (ample)\n• Processing speed (fast)\n• Strength and physicality (yes)\nQualities that chafe me in men\n• Doesn’t understand/share my sense of humor (which is dry, smart, often filthy)\n• Overly cerebral/nerdy/specialistic\n• Controlling, either subtly or overtly, and/or uptight\n• Low risk tolerance, makes decisions from a fear/safety baseline, lacks urgency about living life, not action-oriented\n• Low self confidence\n• Indirect communicator\n• Extrinsically motivated\n• Mood disorders (particularly depressive, unstable temperament, low vitality)\n• Emotionally unregulated and/or immature\n• Religious (I am very secular, in case that’s not 1000% obvious)\nThat’s all you need to know. I don’t need this thing to drag on—I’m confident you’ll know from the above if there’s a possible match or if I’ll make the man you were thinking of referring want to cry and run away (not ideal).\nI haven’t written about the physical attraction/preferences because I can take care of that compatibility aspect myself. What I’m looking for help with here is the character/substance piece. It would take a lot off my plate to know that someone is somewhat pre-vetted based on the above. Support the arts; support my household composting dreams; make a romantic referral (or just share this link with someone in your circle; see more below).\nIf you are wanting to refer yourself, don’t; have a trusted friend reach out on your behalf instead. If you can’t get a friend to vouch for you, I regretfully am not interested.\nHOW TO MAKE A ROMANTIC REFERRAL\nSimply click this button and fill out the short form:\nREFER AN EXCELLENT MAN\nThank you for your assistance with this exciting and delicious matter.\nANOTHER WAY TO HELP\nI get it, you can’t think of anyone to refer at this time.\nThat’s fine, but if I let you off the hook with that I’ll probably get married when I’m 300, which is not what I’m going for. Instead, please share this link/page/whatever it’s called with\none\ninteresting and trusted friend. Just one! It’s so easy, please do it. People know other people, and the sooner we can get me off the market the sooner I can stop writing these posts and roping you into my romance schemes.\nHere’s some sample text. Use as is or make it your own:\nHi (name of your friend), my friend/acquaintance/some random woman named Val is looking for a husband and asked me to share her post about it with an interesting and trusted person in my network. Please read it and keep sharing it so Val can 1. get married and 2. get off my nuts about getting married. Thanks for helping out!\nUPDATE: Some of this is not translating so let me try to clarify further\nThere is no need to approach my ask through a perfectionistic lens: Of course it would be sick, ill\nand\nnasty if you could swiftly and immediately introduce me to my sweet prince, but far more realistically my wish and expectation is that you simply share this page with ONE interesting and trusted friend (not necessarily a man). Then perhaps\nthat friend\nmight share it with ONE interesting and trusted friend of theirs, and on and on and eventually we can arrive at some compatible matches. It’s like the chain letters of yore (remember those?) but without the crazy 90s colorful fonts and flashing webpages and caps in weird places. The ultimate point is to marry me off, but I’m guessing the way to get there is by bringing awareness of my single-against-my-will status to a broader audience and letting networks do their magic. Is this making more sense now? Let me know if still not.\nOther clarifications\nYes I am very open to younger men\nWhen I say I want kids I mean having my own biological kids\nPlease only refer men you admire\nLove is not blind.

      "fullText": "﻿Tony’s Date-me Doc\r\n(Last updated: 15 Nov 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\nN MY UNDERGRADUATE YEARS, I was very focused on my studies.  So when my parents found out after graduation that I had departed from my studies and become interested in solving the world’s problems, they were surprised and worried that I wouldn’t be able to find a proper job.  They asked “why don’t you become a politician?  We can support your further studies.”  I responded that while it is an option, there is one vocation with a greater potential to do good, and that is the philosopher.  I hope that by perpetually learning, understanding perspectives, and experiencing all that the world has to offer, I can philosophise with enough acuity to help guide humanity through these turbulent times and contribute to our roadmap for the future.    \r\nAbout me  \r\n* I am a 25-year-old 175cm-tall man.\r\n* I work as an online tutor, an occupation bestowed upon me by my wanderlust.  Even though I currently live in Melbourne, I could be anywhere, anytime.\r\n* I am agnostic and liberal-leaning.  I don’t drink or smoke.  I neither have nor want children.\r\nCore values\r\nI am a positive, lively, and happy person.  Life is inherently beautiful, and the world is my playground.  I think most people who meet me would say I have a fun, bubbly character.  I loathe to offend others, though I feel disingenuous telling white lies, so I have become quite adept at telling “white truths”.\r\nI am extremely curious.  One of my long-term goals is to “climb the mountain of knowledge”.  This knowledge includes reading undergraduate textbooks on every major university discipline, but equally includes picking up skills and experiences, travelling the natural and cultural world, and so on.  A Chinese proverb tells me “read ten thousand books and journey ten thousand miles”.  Of course, I realise that life is too short to accomplish this goal, but the process matters more to me than the destination.  Besides, the mountain of knowledge has no summit!\r\nI am independent and free-spirited.  I don’t like relying on others, and rarely ask others for favours.  Despite being a bit of a people-pleaser, I am highly resistant to peer-pressure, and do not mind being perceived as quirky.  In thought, I am naturally skeptical and like to come to my own conclusions.\r\nI have many ideas and perspectives.  I love exploring the intangible world through conversation, whether that leans objective (such as STEM, history, society, politics, ...) or subjective (such as life, relationships, experiences, identity, ...).  If I think an opinion is one-sided, I feel an urge to defend other perspectives, as “a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence”.  Because of this, I can play a mighty devil’s advocate, though I realise it is seldom called for.\r\nI am highly greed-avoidant.  I believe that it is possible to live a happy and fulfilling life on a modest amount of money, so I am suspicious of rich people who earn more than they can ever spend.  I would rather do meaningful work voluntarily (and I do) than be paid well to do a bullshit job.  The rich and the poor are both preoccupied with money at the expense of happiness, so I intend to be neither.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tony will no doubt be one of the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. [...] Tony is also incredibly warm and brings a very positive energy to any group activity.”\r\n      — Alan, friend of two years\r\nAbout you\r\nIt is difficult to qualify what one finds attractive.  For me, sharing core values is a good start.  In terms of character, I generally find myself attracted to quieter people who feel deeply, care unabashedly, and whose smile and laughter bring joy to the world.  Having agency and a strong work ethic is also a big plus.  Many of the qualities I am attracted to are shared by affectionate cats, and I confess I absolutely adore cats and it seems they generally like me back!\r\nAbout us\r\nI believe that the happiest relationships are those where the partners are already happy coming into the relationship.  The most uplifting relationships are those where each partner’s strengths inspire the other to grow.  The most loving relationships are those built upon a deep friendship and a genuine respect for each other.  \r\nI’m looking for love that makes life worth living all over again.\r\nIt is said that Zeus knew humans would be too powerful if we weren’t split at birth and condemned to search for our other half.  But really, he just meant us.  We’d be the power couple who saves the world.  Maybe we’ve finally found each other, much to Zeus’ chagrin?  If you think this might be the case, please dispatch a messenger to deliver your message to the following address at once.  We can then conduct a low-stakes holographic encounter through the aether  :)\r\nTW2000X@GMAIL.COM\r\n  More photos of me and my travels"

I’m Sarah McManus\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe basics\r\n* Female\r\n* 36\r\n* 5’8”\r\n* Mostly a weird Buddhist (nonrenunciate)\r\n* Polyamorous\r\n* Looking for a strong primary partnership with a man who wants to raise kids together\r\n* Victoria, BC, Canada (also a US citizen, would consider moving - see more about location)\r\n* For work, I do coaching & workshops for pragmatic action, emotional resilience, and psychedelic integration\r\nWhat I’m like:\r\n* I’m smart, funny, and kind\r\n* I’m pragmatic, communicative, and grounded\r\n* I’m strong!\r\n* I love making beautiful spaces\r\n* Sharing wonderful experiences\r\n* Being with the sacred\r\n* Love languages\r\n* Food, drink, substances\r\nI’m looking for a partner who:\r\n* Is smart, funny, kind\r\n* Values clear communication & emotional awareness, is good enough at it and cares about building skill and insight\r\n* Is attracted to me\r\n* Is oriented toward co-creating the kind of nurturing stability that's a good fit for raising kids\r\n* Wants to raise kids in some larger-than-nuclear-family setting\r\n* Wants to have a strong primary / nesting partnership, with openness to intimacy with others, where we're attuned to the wellbeing of our whole ecosystem of relationships\r\n* Has had meaningful experiences with psychedelics that are resonant with mine\r\n* Vibes with a particular nerdy orientation to like... putting in the effort to get very precise about something when that's what's needed\r\n* Feels drawn to building / creating / growing together\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ideally:\r\n* Is resilient, dependable, keeps his head in a crisis\r\n* Is a burner (goes to Burning Man or regionals)\r\n* Has great body awareness - I find handbalancing, dance, and circus arts very hot, anything that combines flow and strength\r\n\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n* I don’t have much of a height preference! If you’re shorter than me & feel at ease dating a taller woman, heck yeah\r\n* As long as you like women and (in particular) me, no preference about the rest of your sexual orientation! I’ve had great experiences dating bi guys\r\nContact me:\r\nYou can find me on Twitter @SarahAMcManus, or you can email me at mcmanus.sarah.a at gmail\r\n\r\n\r\nMore details about me:\r\nI’m smart, funny, and kind\r\nI feel like these need to go together.\r\nMy sense of humor is very much in-the-moment, connecting a handful of conceptual dots lightning-fast to make a funny shape, or seeing the absurd side of a terrible situation, finding some spaciousness without making it trivial. \r\nFor me, kindness is more about skillful compassion, attunement, warmth, and caring, and less about being nice, or being seen as nice. \r\nI’m pragmatic, communicative, and grounded\r\n“One of the most reasonable people I’ve ever met” – Matt, former partner and current friend\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough long deliberate practice, I’m good at:\r\n* Expressing my needs and wants, capacities and boundaries\r\n* Listening and reflecting\r\n* Checking if communication has gone through\r\n* Laying the groundwork for repairs, knowing that we’ll have ruptures\r\nI’m strong!\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI care about staying active. I got back into weightlifting partly to expand what I can do in acroyoga, partly based on Sasha Chapin’s post about lifting as low-hanging fruit for long-term health, and partly because my twitter mom friends said that being fit helped them have a better experience of pregnancy and childbirth. \r\nI can deadlift 225x5!\r\nI love making beautiful spaces\r\n  \r\n\r\nI made a folding teahouse bartop, and I take it to regional Burning Man events and Vibecamp! \r\nA teahouse is a lovely space to catch your breath and recenter yourself with some good convos and warm beverages before heading back out into a big event. \r\n\r\n\r\nI like it when my living space has interesting art, warm light, jewel tones, lots of plants, comfy places to sit. I love bringing in flowers from the yard, giving flowers to lovers and friends, growing fruits and herbs and vegetables. \r\nSharing wonderful experiences\r\nAcroyoga and dance\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI go to acroyoga, and ecstatic dance, almost every week. \r\nI like contact improv, and I’d like to explore more of the combo of acroyoga lifts + contact flow. I’ve also done a little bit of fusion dance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic!\r\n* I love to sing! From sacred songs and hippie choirs, to writing my own sea shanty about the crews that repair undersea internet cables\r\n* I play with a Zimbabwean-style marimba ensemble! It’s a thing all along the west coast! Here’s the band from the next island over playing some excellently danceable traditional songs, and here’s a clip of me playing a less conventional marimba song. Sometimes I get to play the BIG bass marimba:\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Also, I’m way more skilled with a kazoo than anybody expects\r\n\r\n\r\nMassage, improv, making cool stuff – so many ways to enjoy being human together!\r\n\r\n\r\nNature\r\n* I ALWAYS want to see a cool bug! Or plants, fungi, frogs, other critters, cool rocks, tide pools, shooting stars, the aurora, particularly good clouds…\r\n* I went to undergrad and part of a PhD program in ecology. Narrowly escaped becoming a world expert in shrimp that climb up waterfalls in Puerto Rico.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSeeing the monarch butterflies overwintering in Michoacán  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI like the good shapes and patterns\r\nVisual art I’ve made! \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntumblr archive, scroll down to about 2013\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing with the sacred\r\nThis part is hard to put into words, and it’s important to me. \r\n\r\nThere’s a phrase from a song that really resonates with me: “til ev’ry casual corner blooms into a shrine.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to have a driving sort of overarching sense of mission, but it turned out that was entangled with a correspondingly big sense of there being an overwhelming problem “out there.” I used to think I failed at several big attempts to make a difference, but as more stuff has gotten healed and untangled “in here,” and as I’m leaning more into exploring Dzogchen Buddhist perspectives, and touching into experiences of deep okayness… it seems my sense of purpose is becoming more contextual and harder to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s a thread of what happened the last time I said, “gee I sure wish I felt inspired to make devotional art again\" (and some more recent physical talismans).\r\n\r\nFor now, I often find myself stewarding profound experiences in liminal spaces, and that feels very meaningful to me. For example, this summer will mark my fourth year leading the Sanctuary team at our regional Burning Man event. We put together a big cozy tent where volunteers support folks who are having unexpectedly difficult psychedelic or emotional experiences. It’s a good spot for snot and tears and holy laughter. And we have snacks!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the path is made by walking, and we’ll find out what it’s like as we go along. I want to be in partnership with someone who wants to walk this path with me. \r\nLove languages\r\nI especially enjoy giving and receiving physical touch and acts of service. Words are hard sometimes but when they land they really land.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also all about that one tweet on the “five neurodivergent love languages\":\r\n\"infodumping, parallel play, support swapping, Please Crush My Soul Back Into My Body, and \"I found this cool rock/button/leaf/etc and thought you would like it\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI will 100% research a thing for you as a love language. (ex: debug a health situation, find obscure product or service)\r\nFood, drink, substances\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\r\n\tMe\r\n\tLooking for\r\n\tCigarettes\r\n\tNope! Can’t stand cigarette smoke\r\n\tNonsmoker\r\n\tAlcohol\r\n\tRarely / occasionally\r\n\tAnywhere from none to mindful use\r\n\tWeed\r\n\tRarely / occasionally\r\n\tAnywhere from none to mindful use\r\n\tPsychedelics\r\n\tVery important to me\r\n\tIdeally important for you as well\r\n\tMeat\r\n\tPescetarian (I eat fish, eggs, dairy)\r\n\r\n(I care about where meat comes from - took a workshop on mindful rabbit processing, will eat hunted meat, etc)\r\n\tI’m generally more compatible with omnivores than vegans\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI’m pretty good at cooking, and also enjoy making food together. I’ve won my share of potlucks – I know it’s not a competition, but in my book, if someone asks you for the recipe, that’s a win!\r\nWe’re likely not a fit if\r\n* You can’t handle a touch of the ‘tism\r\n   * Benefits: \r\n      * Strong sense of integrity; natural inclination towards being straightforward and honest\r\n   * Mixed blessings: \r\n      * Will go to great lengths to craft my environment with the good textures / lightbulbs / noises over the bad ones\r\n      * “Don’t worry, I have a System!”\r\n      * Can be stubborn until I feel satisfied about my care or concern\r\n(and occasionally downright ornery – but that’s from my Southern roots)\r\n   * Drawbacks: \r\n   * Sometimes social situations are hard or confusing if the norms are Guess Culture, or if certain kinds of pretending are load-bearing\r\n   * Remembering names & faces requires deliberate effort & practice\r\n\r\n      * You 100% need specific intense kinky dynamics in your primary relationship\r\n      * I’m up for trying some stuff, but if it’s intense power or pain, I’m most likely not your gal.\r\n      * But if it’s something you can explore in another relationship, in a way that’s compatible with our whole deal – that could work!\r\n\r\n\r\n      * Ah, if you’re super allergic to cats I’d be sad! I don’t have a cat at the moment, but I love cats. A house doesn’t quite feel like a home to me without a cat or two.\r\nMore logistics\r\nLocation\r\n      * I’m a Canadian permanent resident & US citizen\r\n      * Originally from the southeast US\r\n      * I’m enjoying Victoria, BC, and would consider moving to somewhere like west coast USA or southern Appalachia\r\n      * I do take moving a lot more seriously now than I used to, because local social connections take years to develop, and I’ve been growing some good roots here over the last 4 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n      * I’m generally not a big city gal. I tend to like smaller cities, ~100-500K, or living an hour or two from a bigger city, with access to nature. I could go more rural or more urban, with the right crew and context.\r\n\r\n      * If you’re not in Canada and want to be, I could sponsor a partner for immigration - though not until 2027 :/ \r\nRelationships and family\r\n         * I generally prefer the more communicative, kitchen-table style of polyamory. \r\n\r\n\r\n         * When I say I’m looking for someone who “wants to raise kids in some larger-than-nuclear-family setting,” this could look like sharing space (like a large house, property w/ multiple structures, or neighborhood) with\r\n         * another couple with compatible parenting intentions\r\n         * some combination of lovers or friends\r\n         * your relatives if we all get along well enough\r\n\r\n\r\n         * I’d like to aim for having 2 kids, ideally starting in the next few years. I find it a little hard to imagine what 3 kids would be like, but I’m open to it if logistics & biology line up. \r\nI went to Mexico this February and froze a good number of eggs, enough for a solid chance at one kid, maybe enough for two. (Ideally I wouldn’t need to use them… while I’d rather not wait that long, my mom had my sibling at 44 and my great-grandmother had my grandmother at 45.)\r\n\r\n\r\n            * I’m divorced. We tried really hard. That relationship ended a few years ago, and while it wasn’t easy, I’ve done a lot of untangling and healing since then. I’m in a good place to date now, which I couldn’t have said a couple years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n            * I’m potentially open to other shapes of relationships, with folks who aren’t compatible as life partners, though that’s really not my focus. Mostly if you’re local to BC, or if we’re already connected through some kind of network of friends or shared purpose and we’ll be going to the same event. \r\nMisc\r\n            * Enneagram 5 is a decent map of some of my patterns growing up, still useful context on how I sometimes get tangled up\r\n            * I speak Spanish (was professionally proficient about 10 years ago, though it’s gotten a bit rusty)\r\nMusic\r\nIf I was going to share one song as part of this dating doc, it’d be “Harmonize” by Rising Appalachia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a whole playlist with some different kinds of music I like, here’s a sampler"

      "fullText": "﻿Julian Michael  \r\n32, male, straight, monogamous, looking for a life partner.\r\n* I live in San Francisco and hope to settle down in the Bay Area long term.\r\n* I want kids (more than one) and I’m seeking someone who wants the same.\r\nAbout me\r\n* Boyish with a feminine side\r\n* Emotionally open and like talking about feelings\r\n* Intellectual and like talking about ideas\r\n* Serious but don’t take myself seriously\r\n* Somewhat extroverted\r\n* Frequently mistaken for people’s husband (...could be us)\r\nAbout you\r\n(negotiable)\r\n* High openness\r\n* Emotionally fluid\r\n* Silly and tolerant of silliness\r\n* Intellectually inclined and passionate about stuff you are excited to share\r\n* Likes spending time outside and/or engaging in physical combat\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a relationship\r\n* Emotional presence, attunement, and acceptance\r\n* Highly explicit communication and mutual accountability\r\n* Challenging each other (from a place of fun and mutual safety)\r\n* Emotional responsibility: we are solely responsible for our own reactions and emotions\r\n* A relationship and eventually a family environment that’s both intellectually and physically playful\r\n* Secure attachment (I like The Mastery of Love, by Don Miguel Ruiz, as a picture of secure love)\r\nStuff I like doing and would be excited to share\r\n(not required activities, but you’ll at least have to put up with these things)\r\n* Reading and learning about (and occasionally practicing off-label) psychology, psychotherapy, meditation and spirituality\r\n* Learning about human physiology, health, and fitness (unfortunately I find the learning a lot more fun than the implementing)\r\n* Cooking, fermentation of all kinds of things\r\n* Movement play, acrobatics, parkour, roughhousing, dancing\r\n* Thinking about language, AI alignment, ethics, epistemology, and how all of these things fit together\r\n* Deliberating the practical ethics of everyday life and relationships\r\nTestimonials\r\nAsya B. (full testimonial): For someone who really loves Julian, I think what will stand out is that he's very beautiful, very silly, and very high EQ (and really likes talking explicitly about his and others' feelings). I genuinely think he's a romantic catch (single mostly because he's picky and just moved to the Bay), so you may want to act fast!\r\n\r\n\r\nKamile L.: My two favorite qualities in Julian as a friend are the same two qualities that will make him an excellent life partner. The first is that he’s uncommonly excited to and uniquely skilled at connecting emotionally with people. Talking to him makes you feel seen and connected, and this skill and character trait of his makes him incredibly capable of helping you resolve problems of the heart. He is my go-to person to advise on challenging emotional questions, and I am somewhat jealous of whoever ends up being his life partner because they will be the first in line to feel loved, seen, and supported. Although I’ve never had serious conflict with Julian directly, I can also see that this openness will make communication easy and misunderstandings rare. Second, Julian is just a ton of fun to be around. Spending time with him is effortless and silly, laughter when around him is plentiful. From my own marriage, I know that this type of joy is a foundation for an excellent life together. These two character traits combined make him a great friend, but I’m so convinced that this will make for an even better life partner.\r\n<more pending>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested? Introduce yourself to me at julianjohnmichael@gmail.com or get a mutual friend to connect us!"

I dress very\nplainly. I act generally quite quiet and speak softly unless it’s on a\ntopic of interest. I live pretty minimalistically (ironic that the word\nfor it is that long!).\nReviews\nI don’t know what you (reader/future-partner) are looking for in\nlife-partners. I also cannot comment on what living with myself or just\nbeing around me is like without sounding biased, so I asked those who\nknow me best and put their answers in the below table. They are all\nhappy to give more details on request. I had no influence in what they\nsaid other than setting 3 rough categories and a character limit - I\nforbade myself from editing. They all submitted these independently of\neach other (to my knowledge) and they all came at it from their own\nunique relationships/histories with me. All information is accurate (in\ntheir opinion) at the time of their review (c. October 2025). All I\nconsider to be at least good friends who I have immense trust in\n(although one slightly less now I’ve seen their review! 😆), but they\nprobably like me too much and are therefore too positive.\nReviews Table\nTable of Reviews\nSex\nYears Known\nConnection\nYears Lived With\nPositive\nNegative\nQuirk\nFemale\n11\nUniversity friend/flatmate (Former unrequited love of mine)\n3\nLearning lots and always having company - you read a lot and know a lot about random things, so conversation was very interesting. I definitely learnt more about darts! It’s hard to be lonely living with you, because you’re always down for a chat and are mostly very cheery (and if not, there is a good reason why). Similarly, you’re always down to go and do random things like visiting all the places on the Oxford Cluedo board. And you’d offer to cook if I’d had a long day which was lovely.\nOccasionally too much maths chat (taking it beyond what I could understand so it got a bit boring). And sometimes you asked general questions about intimate topics, which I often didn’t mind, but sometimes found awkward.\nOccasional piano music wafting around - you’re an excellent and humble pianist. And you emitted other noises such as strong reactions to darts/football which were sweet. Oh, and you didn’t require much storage space, since you cycled through a relatively limited wardrobe and were otherwise fairly minimalist!\nFemale\n11\nUniversity friend/colleague/flatmate\n1\nPositive of living with you - organised, tidy, routines, easy to coexist alongside\nPositive of spending time with you - knowledgeable about a wide range of interesting topics, can provide a different way of looking at things\nNegative of living with you - limited cooking / meal options, somewhat white / beige decorating (this may not be up to date)\nNegative of spending time with you - collective indecisiveness (this goes both ways 😂)\nQuirk / Unusual - relcutance to share your birthday (I don’t particularly celebrate but will share when needed), you sit in the slightly odd space of being stuck on your habits but also willingly to try new things, maintained passions for your whole life, always looking to learn new things (youtube dives), maintained an up to date interest in Maths - hard to know what to put here.\nMale\n7\nColleague (housemate during Covid lockdowns)\n0.75\nReview\nIncoming\nWatch this space\nFemale + Male\n7 + 6\nColleagues (both former-lodgers, married to each other)\n0.25 + 0.25\nMakes you feel welcome\nRespects space + boundaries\nHappy to match vibes on levels of social interaction\nPragmatic to a fault:\nwill keep house + lifestyle in exactly the optimal state for comfortable living\nOnce wrote to the producers of custard cream spread to express discontent at discontinuation (rephrased as “shows character trait of unusually strongly held opinions about certain specific things”, which might be more useful than the anecdote)\nMale + Female\n4 + 3\nColleague + Colleague's partner (both former-lodgers)\n1.5 + 1\nExceptionally laid-back and at-ease with what happens\nPolite and easy-going (sometimes to a fault)\nStop being so damn considerate all the time (sometimes borders on frustrating)\nFinds it hard to accept gifts/offers of things (run several miles rather than accept a lift)\nSo many instances of quirks (‘Andrew-ism’), not sure where to start:\nDistaste for strong flavours and homedecorating\nMake a sandwich by bringing the whole bag, making it as you go\nLikes white bread a lot, more than the average person\nMale\n2\nColleague (former-lodger)\n1\nMaths chat and interesting random chats are a positive. Got a very comfortable carpet and the sofa too. Parking’s good, and has Sky Sports Golf!\nChairs aren’t comfortable, and you need a special technique for opening the door. One time a parcel was delivered for the neighbour and you didn’t realise the whole weekend - unawareness, at times you’re in your own world (but being able to focus deeply is a good thing)\nDefinitely diet: there’s a lot of sugar and not much else.\nFemale\n0.5\nFormer Dating Interest\n0.01\nHonest when it comes to dating. He really is trying to give you the best sense of what he’s like so both you and he can make a good call\nStrongly defined. He’s clear about what he knows he likes and can tell you all about it and why, with fun puzzles to solve along the way. That said\nOpen to talking about anything I’m interested in. I’ve brought up and sent all sorts of entirely unrelated things his way (some of our interests/thoughts align, many differ) and he always has interesting things to ask/say/contribute and seems to have fun doing so\nSeems generally content, which is really nice to be around. Long walks in company are fun.\nThoughtfully proactive: He’ll plan stuff, send you the potential details and check in to see if you’re up for it, pick up little things for you, checks in if you need anything etc.\nEmotional response to you can be unclear/hard to read in person, and is expressed through writing (where to be fair, it is clear). The disparity between in person and writing can be pretty confusing and takes a while to get used to\nSexual attraction to you also harder to gauge if not explicitly brought up\nLess focus in general on the arts/conventional fun/aesthetically pleasing/hedonistic side of life (this one may be most personal-to-me: I happen to think a more balance is nice for a whole host of reasons)\nHe washes his weetabix. With water. In the sink. And then eats it just like that. He claims he “just rinses it” or something to this degree (can’t recall the exact phrasing), but I’m not certain this is much better. On the bright side, he did this with no shame one of the first times he came to my house, and was (and remains) entirely unapologetic about it. If you are going to be the kind of man who does this, leaning in is probably good =).\nImages\nI try to avoid being photographed as best I can, so a representative\nsample is not possible. I detest wearing suits, but black & white is\nfine.\nSuitability\nAs is hopefully obvious to most readers of this document, the\npopulation size of those who want to date me is small (but crucially\nnon-zero). If that’s not you but you would like to message me out of\ngeneral interest/friendship/matchmaking-with-someone-else purposes, I’m\nall ears. I can share a semi-secret personal blog if you would like to\nread more of my musings.\nAction\nIf enough of this sounds like it’s up your street, then feel free to\ncontact me at\nAndrewEADateMe@gmail.com\nwith any questions,\na funny dad-joke, and/or any relevant details/links about yourself and\nwe can take it from there.\nDisclaimer(s)\nI may have given a slightly misleading impression of how\nmathematically minded I am in the\n“My\nInterests”\ntable for comedic purposes. I basically find almost any\ntopic that requires thinking to be interesting and worth discussing. But\nI cannot hide that I am an enthusiastically mathematical person and this\nwas my best way of making that very clear and filtering out people who\nmight find that off-putting.\n(*): If you scrolled to the end (thank you!), then I expect you’re\nsufficiently interested but non-mathematical\n1\n, so to be clear I’ll\nprobably be in my early 30s when you’re reading this. If this statement\nis incorrect then it’s probably safe to say hardly anyone is reading\nthis by then and/or I might have forgotten I have made this document or\nnot bothered to exhaustively debug all dates.\nOr mathematical-enough to work it out yet mildly lazy,\nwhich is fine by me - the best maths is motivated by lethargy! I did\nconsider writing some Javascript to dynamically change the document\nbased on the current date, but I’m definitely too lazy for that.\n↩︎"

My name is Monel :) \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore pictures here\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of October 2025, I’m based in Portland, Oregon, USA. \r\n\r\n\r\nProfessionally, I am the medical resident at an integrative clinic in Portland and specialize in naturopathic mental health and somatic medicine.

Naturopathic medicine blends modern scientific research with natural and traditional forms of medicine to help activate the body's inherent ability to heal. The focus is not just on managing symptoms, but on addressing the underlying causes of illness by treating the whole person—mind, body, and spirit. We serve as a doctor and a teacher, empowering the patient with the knowledge and personalized tools, like nutrition and lifestyle counseling, to achieve and maintain optimal health.\r\n* My LinkedIn \r\nLong Term Aspirations:\r\n* Host gatherings on a forested property in the PNW with a garden, sauna, and other homesteading features\r\n* Raise 1-2 children with conscious parenting\r\n* Open a private practice\r\n* Write a book\r\n* Continue to travel the world \r\n* Live a long life full of love, wisdom, and depth\r\nWhat I do for fun:\r\n* Social: dinner parties, potlucks, intentional relating (Authentic Relating, Circling)\r\n* Mind-Body: Vipassana meditation, sauna and cold plunge, plant medicine\r\n* Nature: forest bathing, backpacking, hiking, camping \r\n* Dance: Contact Improvisation, Butoh, Ecstatic Dance\r\n* Performance art: Clown, Social Practice\r\n* Sports: Badminton, Pickleball, Tennis, Bouldering, White water kayaking\r\n* Music: DJ Monel on Soundcloud \r\nPersonality:\r\n* Astrology: Sagittarius Sun, Aquarius Moon, Cancer Ascendant\r\n* Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)\r\n* Human Design: Manifesting Generator\r\n* Chinese Astrology: Year of the Dragon\r\n* I am grounded, logical, and have emotional maturity\r\n* I am good at advocating my needs\r\n* I am low technology and try to be off screens as much as possible\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMovement and Nourishment \r\n\r\n\r\nA little story about me:\r\nI was born in Seoul, Korea and moved to west Los Angeles when I was 9 months old. My father had lived most of his adult life in the US and wanted to get his MBA at USC. I attended Carlthorp School then Marlborough School, and undergrad at Williams College in western Massachusetts to become a contemporary art curator. Along the way I heavily pursued Buddhist psychology living at various Zen temples and Buddhist retreat centers. While learning German in Berlin, I discovered activist art and changed my major to Studio art when I returned to school. I won a travel scholar grant to study activist art in Korea and eventually focused on durational performance art and social practice. After college I lived at an intentional community for contact improvisation called Earthdance Creative Living Project where I studied Body-Mind Centering, Authentic Movement, and a host of other embodied anatomy movement practices. I returned to Los Angeles to study Continuum Movement with Emilie Conrad until she passed away in 2014. I decided to dedicate my career to combining somatics with medicine and completed post baccalaureate pre medical training at UCLA Extension while studying craniosacral therapy. That led me to the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland Oregon where I reside to this day. \r\n  Community/Friendships:\r\n* Fernhill Ecstatic Dance\r\n* Thursday Night Contact Improvisation\r\n* Korean American Coalition, KAC Oregon\r\n                \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks That Have Shaped Me:\r\n   * New Self, New World by Philip Shepherd  \r\n   * The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle\r\n   * Unlimiting Mind: The Radically Experiential Psychology of Buddhism by Andrew Olendzki \r\nValues:\r\n   * Universal love\r\n   * Sovereignty\r\n   * Curiosity and open mindedness \r\n   * Taking initiative \r\n   * Integrity\r\n   * Growth mindset \r\n   * Kindness\r\n   * Generosity\r\n   * Empathy\r\n   * Optimism\r\n   * Nonjudgement\r\n   * Unattachment\r\n   * Creativity\r\n   * “Seek first to understand”\r\nWhat others have said:\r\n   * Words about me\r\n   * “You have one of the most vital energies of someone I have felt” - Akash Gama\r\n   * “I have smelled a lot of people, but you have the rolls royce of smells” - Dean Evans \r\n   * “5/5 stars, would date again” “You have great genes, you should definitely procreate” - Phil Illy \r\n   * “Your voice is so soothing, I could listen to you all day.” Thom LaFond\r\nRelationship\r\nGeneral compatibility stuff:\r\n   * Gender/Orientation:\r\n   * Pansexual female \r\n   * Religion:\r\n   * Raised Protestant, currently none \r\n   * Recreational substances\r\n   * Non smoker (no tobacco or cannabis), seldom drinker (wine tasting yes)\r\n   * Entheogens \r\n   * Soon-to-be licensed psilocybin facilitator \r\n   * Politics\r\n   * Apolitical, issue-based bipartisan \r\n   * Lifestyle\r\n   * Diet: whole foods, home cooking, occasional processed foods\r\n   * Environmental: scent-free, avoid microplastic and petroleum based products \r\n   * Fitness\r\n   * Yoga, running, outdoor sports\r\nRelationship Intentions and preparation: \r\n   * Do you know how to regulate your nervous system after getting triggered?\r\n   * Do you know what unresolved relational patterns or attachment wounds you could potentially be bringing into the relationship? \r\n   * What are your relationship boundaries/needs/requests/demands - do you know the difference between each, and do you know how to clearly communicate them? \r\n   * Do you know what your heart needs to feel safe and connected? \r\n   * Are you able to fully accept and enjoy love without suspicion, doubt, or the constant anxiety that something bad is inevitably going to happen? \r\n   * Do you know the difference between your inner child's needs and your adult self's needs in a relationship? \r\n   * Do you have clarity around what you actually want from a relationship? \r\n   * Have you been emotionally available to yourself in these ways? \r\n   * Are you emotionally available to the love you're seeking? \r\nI like people who:\r\n   * Eat vegetables and whole foods, generally avoid processed food \r\n   * Have a relationship with nature and the earth\r\n   * Meditate regularly or have attended meditation retreats\r\n   * Have participated in counseling, therapy or are familiar with self-reflection\r\n   * Practice embodiment and feel comfortable in their own skin\r\n   * Have a growth mindset and have experience with improving behaviors\r\n   * Are free of substance use or addiction\r\n   * Have experienced oneness and mind-expansive states through fasting, plant medicine, meditation, chanting, or prayer\r\n   * Have earned-secure or secure attachment\r\n   * Want to live a long healthy life and take care of their body\r\n   * Have deep relationships with people in their community \r\n   * Express positive regard with current and past relationships \r\n   * Have emotional and financial stability\r\n   * Are supportive of me fostering close friendships which include platonic affection\r\nHow I resolve conflict: \r\n   * With Nonviolent communication or thoughtful language\r\n   * If escalated conflict, ask a third party for mediation\r\nThings you should know about me in relationships:\r\nLifestyle\r\nTypical week night\r\nTypical weekend \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get in touch: \r\nFeel free to email me or add me on Facebook/ping me on Messenger about what resonated, what you’re working on, thinking about, or learning lately!"

      "fullText": "﻿Rahul’s Date-Me-Doc\r\nAs of Oct 2025\r\n________________\r\nAbout Me\r\nHey, I’m Rahul, an Indian-born-German living in Berlin for over 6 years.\r\nAge: 29 years young\r\nHeight: 178.5 cm\r\nLanguages: English, German, Hindi, plans to learn Spanish\r\nZodiac: Aries (I don't believe in it, but maybe it matters to you)\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality Snapshot\r\nEmotionally steady, reliable, and funny in a dry, situational way. I'm not carrying any past traumas (not that I know of) and I don't plan to acquire one in the future either.\r\nI’m a planner at heart —  I like to plan and organise things. Events, trips, life in general. You can join the planning.. or just follow. But at the same time I’ll also say yes to a spontaneous “Let’s go to Budapest tomorrow.”\r\nI’m generally extroverted, though I start off a bit shy. Once comfortable, I’m quite playful, occasionally awkward, and sometimes philosophical. I’m a lot more romantic (and sarcastic) than I let out in the first meeting.\r\nWhat else\r\n* I don't have a pet but I like dogs — personally believe Huskies are the best.\r\n* Can assemble IKEA furniture without (much) damage.\r\n* I also curate Spotify playlists for every mood — except sadness.\r\nMy life can sometimes be a bit chaotic and other times super calm. I love both sides of it.\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n\r\nLifestyle & Hobbies\r\nOutdoors - Hiking, gym, (ice) skating, dancing, swimming, walks, runs, anything that gets me moving (except biking in Berlin weather).\r\n\r\n\r\nIndoor Fun - Karaokes, cooking, dancing, game nights, movie nights, plant care, thinking of home improvement ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote that dancing is present in both Outdoor and Indoors :D \r\n\r\nI love water bodies and like to spend time around one whenever possible. Beaches, lakes, rivers, bathtubs…whatever I can find.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to socialise and occasionally party (like once a month), but unlike most such people I don't need any external ‘help’ to have fun. In general I have a high social energy which I don't expect my partner to match 100% but maybe meet halfway there. \r\nOh, and I also love dancing Salsa (cuban style) - a bit off-beat, but full of enthusiasm.\r\nWhen cooking I am always trying new things to get that perfect Sunday breakfast. Sometimes I have tears of joy, other times just tears. My current speciality is ‘Cheese Avocado Toasts and Poached eggs’\r\nIn general I have a very adaptable lifestyle — candle light dinners, lake days, clubs, saunas, jump house, raves — I am down for everything! Pick your vibe :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing that I enjoy the most is ‘a new experience’. I will almost always say yes to a new activity that I haven’t done before. \r\n________________\r\n  \r\n\r\nThings That Matter to Me\r\nImportant: Health & Fitness - I don't smoke, don’t consume drugs and drink very little alcohol and eat ‘relatively healthy’. I also like to maintain an overall fit lifestyle by regular workouts and runs. I take care of myself and like people who do too. Almost 30 and no back pain!\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant: Ambitions (self improvement) - I like having a vision or goals in every phase of life — Career, Fitness, Learning, Travelling. It doesn't matter big or small but I like it when I am constantly moving forward otherwise life starts to stagnate. I’d love a partner who also has her own direction in life. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindness > Coolness - I’m drawn to warmth, patience, and people who treat others well. I understand a lot of men confuse a girl being nice with flirting, which can be extremely annoying, but I still hope that this doesn't become a reason for being rude to other people.\r\n\r\n\r\nI value emotional honesty, curiosity, and people who ask questions that don’t have simple answers. I love when someone can challenge me, tease me, and make ordinary moments memorable. And I would do the same for them. \r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nbut.. Red flags (because honesty is hot)\r\nUnfortunately I'm not perfect. I have red flags too that you should know about.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I listen to Christmas songs in January\r\n* I can eat spice but at times I overestimate my spice tolerance…\r\n* Strong urge to say something funny in a serious situation.\r\n* I can’t drive yet but love road trips (backseat DJ unlocked). Going through the License process right now.\r\n________________\r\n💫 What I’m Looking For (And Also What I Provide)\r\nEvery one is different and I don’t expect anyone to be exactly how I want. We all have our strengths and flaws, but that is also what makes us beautiful and keeps our life exciting. But I am still hoping to find someone who is emotionally aware, funny and knows how to both talk and listen. I value relationships where both people have independence and togetherness in balance.\r\nMy love language - Physical touch, words of encouragement, thoughtful gestures and making each other laugh. And yours?\r\nI believe connection grows through curiosity, effort, honesty, laughter, and showing up — even when it’s not perfect (especially when it's not perfect!). Ideally we shouldn't be threatened by an existential crisis for every single unplanned change happening around us. \r\nBonus points if you:\r\n* Loves music or dancing (or tolerates my off-beat dancing).\r\n* Enjoys long walks or spontaneous trips.\r\n* Would make flirty gestures while I cook dinner ;)\r\nI believe before sharing a happy life together, we should each be happy on our own. Relationships won’t erase the ups and downs — they just make the ride a little warmer and funnier. If we cannot handle issues in our single life then we will struggle in relationships too.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. A little secret: The more you flirt with me while I’m cooking, the better the food gets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe we could be a match feel free to reach out to me on rahulgoyal.rago@gmail.com or https://www.instagram.com/ra_go_/ or telegram on @RaGo2203. Or if you know someone else who you think would be a good match for me then forward it to them :)"

Like, a serious relationship. A Big Relationship. While I met all my previous loves through organic/IRL activities, I’m open to connecting with someone online. Maybe that’s you! 😱💘\nLet’s go.\nTable of contents\nWhy am I so weird?\nWhat am I looking for?\nWhat can I offer?\nHow would we actually get to know each other, Mister Nomad?\nA few references, real and otherwise.\nOkay, interesting…\nMy face in the Dolomites, Sept 2024\nWhy am I so weird?\nBecause weird is the only way to be! But perhaps you mean\ndesperate\n, because I have my own dating page? I don’t see this as an act of desperation, rather an intentional experiment in service of\nONE OF LIFE’S BIGGEST DECISIONS\n.\nAlgorithms dictate enough of our lives already—looking at you, Discover Weekly—and the apps are full of too many\nPerfectly Nice Normal People\ncraving\nPerfectly Nice Normal Lives\n.\nI’m weird in many ways. Ever since I was a child, I’ve had an active imagination and voracious intellect. A few good books and\nunconventional\nmentors\nradically influenced my young adult trajectory. I’ve lived much of my life in community, in nature, on the road, and as a guest. (\nThis\nis a fairly typical Blake-year.) I’m fueled by big projects, new horizons, and deep connections. Normal jobs, homes, and relationships aren’t exactly my thing. So here I am, seeking a partner-in-crime in my own weird way.\nThe links go to my\nwriting\n, evidence of my\nparticular\nbrand\nof\nweirdness\n.\nRunning on the Tahoe Rim Trail, 2023\nWhat am I looking for?\nI’ll offer a few concrete details and then describe the spirit of the thing.\nDetails:\nYou’re a fit, strong, outdoorsy woman. You have pooped in the woods.\nYou have pooped in the woods!\nYou’re in a good financial position: bills don’t stress you out each month, giving you options in life, not just obligations. You have solo traveled abroad.\nYou have solo traveled abroad!\nYou’ve found an interesting way to earn money doing something meaningful. Your work doesn’t dominate your life, and you enjoy\ntime wealth\n. You’re a lover of ideas who reads books, listens to podcasts, and debates with friends. You may or may not want kids, or already have them. You’re not entangled with an ex. Your age probably begins with a “3.” You’re ready for something real—not necessarily forever, but real.\nSpirit:\nRarely have you felt like you “fit in” anywhere in particular. It’s hard to stay settled, because you know how big the world is, and you want to experience it. Friendships matter deeply to you, as do the people you serve. You have a profound relationship with nature which cannot play second fiddle to city life for very long. You’re not looking for someone to complete you, as you are already complete. Your other, non-romantic relationships could genuinely sustain you. But you see romantic partnership as another great adventure, one you don’t want to miss. You have a long-standing orientation toward freedom, both for yourself and your partner. Freedom inclines you toward commitment.\nWith my brother in Buenos Aires, March 2024\nWhat can I offer?\nGreat conversation, moral support, foot/back rubs, mountain adventure partnership, co-counseling in the style of “why\nnot\nattempt this seemingly crazy but delicious idea?”, creative collaboration, spontaneous dances, quiet evenings reading together on a couch, winters spent together in sunny places, petting cats on the street, plenty of time+space to do your own thing—and tacos, so many tacoooos! 🌮🌮🌮\nMaybe\na co-parent who seriously buys into the “travel the world with kids” notion.\nMaybe\na child-free partner who nonetheless enjoys hanging with friends’ kids and taking them on amazing adventures. 100%: a trustworthy, high-stoke, sun-loving, cheery-optimistic California boy.\nMama always said, “date a boy who can dance.” Evidence:\n1\n/\n2\nHow would we actually get to know each other, Mister Nomad?\nValid question! Wouldn’t it be nice if we lived in the same place and could casually meet like\nNORMAL PEOPLE?\nAlas, unlikely to happen. So here’s my next best idea.\nFirst,\na\nvideochat\n. No expectations! Let’s just assume we’ll have a nice conversation and become friends, acquaintances, or two charming, oddly good-looking ships passing in the night. If we vibe, more videochats.\nIf vibes are\nstrong\n, we craft\na mutually exciting plan to meet\n. This could be me visiting you, you visiting me, or both of us meeting someplace new, for a few days to a few weeks. Did you ever read\nThe craziest OkCupid date ever\n? It’s an inspiring (and admittedly extreme) blueprint for what’s possible. Even if it “doesn’t work out,” we both have a fun story to tell our friends:\nWe ended our journey after eight countries, 3,500 miles and 21 days in the same clothes. Our romantic relationship intact, Jeff and I boarded the Heathrow return flight as closer friends than ever (despite the questionable state of our undergarments). Materially speaking I was as empty-handed as the day we started, but I actually carried a great deal back home across the Atlantic. Traveling with no luggage and no plans was much more than a minimalist lesson in living well with less. It was an intense, in-your-face invitation to the unknown. There’s a truly magnificent side to the unknown, but we aren’t taught how to welcome it, let alone explore the breadth of its possibilities.\nAfter this point,\nwe are two adults who figure things out\n.\nI’m genuinely open to creating a life in many different parts of the world—as long as it’s not the same place all the time!\nCycling with friends on the Carretera Austral, 2024\nA few references, real and otherwise.\nSome years ago, I asked close friends to write\ndating endorsements\n, which are like job references but far more entertaining.  👉🏽\nHere’s what they said\n👈🏽\nAnd here are some\nfictional references from my exes\n, which I wrote:\nE1\n: “Blake’s a lot of fun, and very enthusiastic. He can also fall in love awfully quickly. Maybe dial down the romanticism from a 10 to a 7?”\nE2\n: “It was pretty easy to live with Blake. I was also flexibly self-employed, and it was nice to spend time together when others were working 9-to-5. He helped me with my art shows. It kinda sucked when he went away for multiple months on those teen trips. He’s got some sort of addiction to the mountains, like it’s some core part of his identity. He judged me for not being ‘adventurous’ enough. Get over yourself, man.”\nE3\n: “Blake and I fell for each other despite living on different continents. We loved going to dances together. In the beginning it was invigorating, but eventually I realized that he’s probably never, ever, going to settle down. I wanted to have a rather normal life in a single place, while he wanted to live in some magical land of infinite possibility, sunshine, and chocolate. I do appreciate the effort he put into establishing a friendship after we broke up. Dating Blake could be chaotic, but it was a meaningful, memorable kind of chaos.”\nE4\n: “He’s a great cycle touring partner. He’ll cook for you and clean your kitchen afterwards. And it’s fun to work on creative projects together. Beyond that, I’m not sure what to say. He’s got a bit too much time on his hands.”\nAnother great lurking opportunity:\nTikTok\n!\nDesolation Wilderness, California, 2021\nOkay, interesting…\nWhere do we go from here?\nYou’re welcome to reach out directly (📧yourstruly@blakeboles.com), but you’re also invited to\nemail my friend Julie\n(📧 mcp.julie@gmail.com).\nJulie and I have known each other for 20+ years. She’s a long-time adventure/travel buddy, former co-worker,\nx\n-life-crisis confidant, and all-around homie. She knows me well, and she’s super kind.\nIf you’re not sure if our brands of weird match, think of Julie as a\nWEIRDNESS TRANSLATOR\nwho can grease the wheels and act as a sounding board for any questions you might have. She’s great with confidentiality. THANK YOU JULIE!\nBromiga Extraordinaire\nBest of luck in your own dating journey!\n💘\n(see also: Nick Gray’s\nTokyo Blind Date\n, which is fantastic)\n© Blake Boles, forever & ever\nwho are you?\n|\ncontact\n|\n💻\n|\n🪩\n|\n☕\n🔝"

Introduction\nHi, I’m Monel, a 36-year-old Korean-American naturopathic doctor and performance artist living in the Pacific Northwest. I speak Korean, English, and conversational Spanish and German. My days flow between patient care, artistic exploration, and outdoor adventures in the forested trails nearby.\n2. Connection Goals\nI’m seeking a life partner—someone who shares the desire to build a biological family rooted in love, play, and shared growth. I’m in the PST timezone with a flexible schedule, and I most enjoy connecting through video calls and in-person meetups where energy and presence can be felt more fully.\n3. Core Values\nIntegrity: living in alignment with my words and actions.\nKindness: leading with compassion toward myself and others.\nCreativity: approaching life as an ongoing artistic and healing process.\n4. Interests & Activities\nI find joy in contact improvisation dance, hiking, and backpacking in nature. I love exploring somatics and interoception, and I often unwind by experimenting with new recipes and tasting unfamiliar flavors. Movement, sensory exploration, and curiosity are my gateways into connection—with myself and others.\n5. Personality & Thinking Style\nI think emotionally, creatively, and logically, often weaving all three into how I approach life. While I identify loosely as an ENFP, I see personality as fluid and context-dependent. My humor leans toward playful and introspective, and I value conversations that dance between depth and delight.\n6. Lifestyle & Preferences\nI live a healthy, balanced lifestyle—exercise daily, eat mostly whole foods, and rarely drink or smoke. I currently rent a home with two close friends, and I’m hoping to own a place next year. I work a hybrid 9-5 resident position at a clinic, blending structure with flexibility.\n7. Health & Self-Improvement\nI’ve been dedicated to therapy and self-growth since I was 16, exploring modalities like Internal Family Systems and deep self-inquiry. My current focus is cultivating self-love and integration—learning to meet each inner part with acceptance and curiosity.\n8. Romantic Relationships\nI’m pansexual, though I tend to lean toward the middle of the Kinsey scale (2.5). My love languages are quality time and physical touch, expressed through presence, playfulness, and care. I hope to co-create a partnership that supports mutual evolution, embodied intimacy, and a shared dream of family life.\n9. Ideal Connections\nI feel most at ease with embodied, grounded people who are self-aware, intuitive, and comfortable in their own skin. I’m drawn to those who value clear communication, vulnerability, and emotional honesty—people who meet life with both reverence and humor.\n10. Altruistic & Community Values\nI care deeply about environmental sustainability and holistic healthcare access. I aspire to contribute to communities that prioritize wellbeing, ecological awareness, and equitable systems of care.\n11. Conversation Starters\nWhat is your inner dialogue like?\nHow are you connected to your body?\nWhat creative endeavors help you feel most alive?\nEndorsements\nIf you know them, write something nice that adds to their profile."

      "fullText": "﻿Hi, I'm Ori!\r\nI'm looking for a playful companion to go on shared missions, the piece of myself I don’t know that I am missing... If you resonate with what you read, you can just send me your profile, a small description of yourself and/or answer one of the icebreaker questions I put for you at the bottom. My email: ashesphoenix235@gmail.com\r\nIf you know someone who you think fits, feel free to send them the link to this doc.\r\nAll photos from 2023\r\n    \r\n                                                                                                                         The one with the white shirt is me.\r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\nbased on recent endorsements: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t[Placeholder for sophisticated show-don't-tell pieces of text that display that some of those adjectives apply to me.]\r\nOther long-term customer reviews: \"She is a rare dialectical mix of very rational and very emotional.\"\r\n“Looks like Tinkerbell”\r\n\tWhat tests say about me: \r\n* BIG 5: Very high “Openness to Experience” and “Agreeableness”, average “Emotional Stability”, “Extraversion”, and “Conscientiousness”.\r\n* Outlier scores: Mensa member, hyper-phantasia (vivid mental experiencing), Highly Sensitive Person (HSP: feeling intensely).\r\n* Hogwarts hat announced: 37% Ravenclaw, 29% Gryffindor, 19% Hufflepuff, 15% Slytherin.\r\nWhat I say about myself:\r\n* Ordinary romantic carbon-based cell-cluster looking for their person\r\n* I am into science, entrepreneurship, psychology, health, AI, Sci-Fi, love, and making music. \r\n* I have a personality, hobbies, and questions, like lists and statements with percentages.\r\n\r\nSome hard facts\r\nBody: tiny, athletic (exercises almost every day), in her thirties, overestimated 38% muscle mass (the rest is mainly cucumber), vegan, and low-carb when convenient.\r\nOrientation: Hetero, monogamous, on the demi- and sapiosexual spectrum, switch, unlikely to want kids (20%, in case my future partner can inspire me with his vision of a family and the shared mission around it).\r\nLocation: Currently living in Berlin, but want to move somewhere else. Looking for one or more places to make and call home. Often traveling to explore different cities.\r\nSome soft facts\r\nGood conversationalist. People who have just met me frequently state that they enjoyed conversing with me to an unusual extent, that they feel seen and inspired. Also, partners and friends often acknowledge my constructive and compassionate way I deal with and communicate during conflicts, even in heated situations or when I feel hurt.\r\nFemale MacGyver: I can heat the flat by opening the oven, prepare eggs in a water cooker, find and use the holes in systems. My time on this planet has shown again and again that problem-solving to bring something useful and new to life seems to be my superpower.\r\n\r\nWhat I do\r\nMy calling. The work I do isn't just a career—it's an extension of my deepest hope for humanity. Each small victory in creating positive change fills me with a sense of purpose that resonates through everything else in my life. Operating at the intersection of science, mental health, and kindergarten-ing (leadership ;), I founded, built, and manage a Non-Profit Organization. Based on the principles of Effective Altruism, we aim to do good better and to prove if we actually do that. Soon, I'll attempt to build something new. One thing I am proud of is that I have been the youngest professor ever appointed at the university where I used to work.\r\nMaking music. I play the keyboard and the organic instrument (voice ^.^), very gladly and very mediocre. Single-player and multiplayer modes are available. Genres: mainly jazz, rock, and soul. Covers, improvising, or songwriting. My favorite quote from myself: \"Nothing is so bad that you can't write a good song about it.\" I might get excited to show you songs I contributed to or wrote at trust level 3.\r\nLearning. Learning new things lights a fire in me that's hard to describe—it's that rush of connecting dots, of seeing the world through a new lens, of feeling my mind expanding.There is a long list of topics I'd like to dive into. Recent topics I've learned more about: ETFs, spine-related and supplement science (medical stuff), and how to build and prompt LLM agents. Also, I am still on the journey to finding a type of dance to do regularly again. The latest ones tested: contact improvisation, Bachata and Swing dance (beginner+), before that, pole dance, and Aerial hoop (not so much a beginner).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy social life\r\nCommunities: I love mingling at national and international weekends/events organized by communities such as Dynamite Circle, Effective Altruism, LessWrong, Mensa, Burning Man.\r\nSharing. Understanding how the world works and what it looks like for other people, especially those close to me and those I admire, has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was a teenager. Many thoughts during my day are dedicated to this. I love listening to people sharing their latest insights, ideas, or solutions they came up with, e.g., their new start-up pitch, or results from their daily observations or experiments with reality.\r\nClose ones. The friendships I treasure most are the \"Frodo & Sam\" type, where silence feels as comfortable as conversation, where the connection remains unshaken even through life's storms, and where you know you could call at 4 am, and they'd be there for you as you'd be for them. I feel lucky and thankful to have a few of those humans in my life.\r\nWhat I am looking for\r\nTL;DR: A vulnerable Chuck Norris with empathy ;-). A loving and deep companionship.\r\nI'm seeking someone whose presence feels like coming home after a long journey— safe, and exactly where I'm meant to be. Someone whose mind challenges mine and who knows the melody of my heart by heart.\r\n   * Male and single, 26–43 years old\r\n   * Caring, cognitively and emotionally empathetic\r\n   * Altruistically ambitious: works or would like to work on projects that make the world better. No astrology or healing stones stuff :-)\r\n   * Intellectually excitable: enjoys learning, exploring with their mind, and growing together\r\n   * Emotionally in tune and mature, secure attachment style, high reliability\r\n   * Overall healthy lifestyle: does not need to be a vegan yogi, just someone who takes care of themselves and their future self to age in a healthy way\r\n   * Playful and humorous\r\nPlus points:\r\n   * Would be okay to live in one or multiple moderately-sized cities (300k-1M) close to larger bodies of water, and somewhere not too cold in the winter\r\n   * Has a creative outlet one can engage in together, e.g., plays at least one instrument well, and maybe would like to jam together\r\n   * Might be interested in working on projects, initiatives, or organizations together one day\r\nIn case you’re uncertain how to approach me, here are some icebreaker questions you could answer:\r\n   * What is your current mission, and what would you rise from the ashes for?\r\n   * What was a bold decision that you made recently?\r\n   * What is one thing you changed your mind about recently, and the reason why you did?\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo, no, pinky promise, this is really me! ;-)"

I enjoy philosophy, science, nature, and mindful physical activity, living simply while prioritizing honesty and meaningful relationships.\nDetailed Description\nI  speak English and French fluently and I’m currently in Europe, but I have recently lived in the US (for 4 years) and India (for 6 months). I'm mostly looking for\nCollaborations: working together on a joint project that we enjoy. I started Compass, and I'm actively looking for ambassadors to volunteer together and share the platform with their network! We could have meetings and discuss how to reach the people who would benefit from it the most. Regardless, hit me up if you have anything to say about Compass! I'm also happy to work on any other project we find meaningful.\nFriendships: mostly to discuss online and share deeper things (see details below).\nLife partnership: with a woman who deeply resonates with what I wrote below.\nCore Values\nHighly stable and non-negotiable guiding principles that shape my worldview, decisions, and moral framework.\nIntellectual curiosity with rational integrity: I evaluate beliefs against evidence and enjoy conversations that challenge and expand my thinking.\nEthical responsibility / Utilitarian-leaning ethics: I consciously act to reduce suffering and improve outcomes on a large scale—through causes like animal welfare, climate change, AI safety, and global poverty.\nEmotional stability and resilience: I remain calm under stress, self-soothe effectively, and approach conflicts with reason rather than panic or overreaction.\nDeep, loving relationships: I thrive in profound 1-on-1 connections where accountability, honesty, and mutual growth are prioritized.\nGrowth-oriented conflict resolution: I engage in solution-focused dialogue, tolerate relational discomfort, and prioritize repair over avoidance.\nIntegrity & deliberateness: I aim to live according to my principles and consciously cultivate trust, depth, and clarity during relationships.\nTolerance for differences: I’m very willing to connect with people who fit more than 70% of these values, embracing trade-offs and growth together.\nLifestyle & Secondary Values\nTraits or principles that matter to me, but are negotiable or context-dependent. Mostly applying to life partnerships—not friendships.\nLife Vision & Practicalities:\nGeography: I enjoy living in Europe but am open to relocate if circumstances align.\nFamily: I’d like 1–2 children within roughly 5–10 years, depending on mutual readiness.\nCareer / lifestyle: I support a partner’s work and ambitions, as long as we can spend meaningful time together (2+ hours most days).\nFinancial approach: I live frugally, saving or donating the rest, but am comfortable if my partner spends more on things meaningful to her.\nAttachment & Intimacy Needs\nConflict & repair: I notice when someone is hurt, but I do not chase them if they withdraw. I prefer calm, constructive conversations when both sides are ready. Because I'll care about you, I'll express it when I think you may be wrong—at the same time, I'll always have your back.\nEmotional intelligence: I’m aware of my emotions and take time to process before responding, which helps me stay calm in tense moments. I try to express my feelings honestly, listen carefully to understand others, and take responsibility when I misstep. I believe that, with mutual effort, we can keep strengthening our emotional intelligence and connection as a healthy, securely attached couple.\nEmotional expressiveness: More through words, modest body language and thoughtful gifts than grand gestures.\nPreferred intimacy style: I enjoy direct and meaningful connections—long dedicated conversations over frequent, shallow texts. I seek a monogamous relationship.\nLifestyle Habits & Daily Rhythms:\nDietary choices: Mostly vegan; I strongly value sensitivity to animal well-being.\nSleep & energy patterns: Typically 11pm–8am; similar routines are a plus.\nExercise & health: Small-group activities several times per week. Open to mental health practices to improve relationships and wellbeing.\nSocial engagement: Few close friendships; comfortable connecting with more socially active or community-involved partners.\nFamily engagement: Average.\nMinimalism: I live a simple and non-performative life without clutter, in order to focus on what truly matters.\nEmotional & Cognitive Style:\nHumor: Mix of wit, playful absurdity, and sarcasm.\nTolerance for uncertainty: Comfortable with ambiguity, but appreciate clear plans when possible.\nRomantic philosophy: Love grows deliberately; romance and thoughtful gestures (e.g., poems) are enjoyable once fundamental compatibilities are aligned.\nRole expectations: Prefer equal partnership, but open to specialization if mutually desired.\nInterests & Activities\nActivities or pursuits I enjoy but that don’t define my ethics or essential lifestyle.\nIntellectual pursuits: Reading nonfiction, exploring philosophy, science, history, and practical wisdom; hands-on learning through building and fixing things.\nDeep conversation: Intense, thoughtful dialogue with like-minded people.\nOptimization & personal growth: Exploring methods to improve life, productivity, and learning practices.\nNature & mindfulness: Contemplative walks or time in natural landscapes; pausing to observe wildlife or scenery inspires awe.\nPhysical activities: Running, biking, swimming, weightlifting—often integrated with mindfulness.\nInfluences\nContents that majorly influenced my worldview.\nBooks:\nThinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman\nThe Art of Living a Meaningless Existence - Robert Pantano\nLe Petit Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\nL’étranger - Albert Camus\nExistential Physics - Sabine Hossenfelder\nThe Big Picture - Sean Carroll\nDoing Good Better - William MacAskill\nEmotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman\nWaking Up - Sam Harris\nDeep Work - Cal Newport\nSapiens - Yuval Noah Harari\nBeing the Change - Peter Kalmus\nYouTube channels:\nThe Pursuit of Wonder\nKurzgesagt\nFeel free to send recommendations or discuss any content you like!\nAbout You\nTo an imperfect extent, I like who I am and what I do, and would like to see it in the people around me. So, I’m mostly looking for people who identify—at least partially—with the description above and would enjoy the same activities. I believe in growth and potential; so I embrace people who are not there yet (so am I) but have, deep inside, the intention to reach it.\nAs long as you fit some of the description, relationships, to me, transcend gender, age, culture, financial situation, or any other socio-demographic factors; please reach out to me regardless of your situation if you relate to my personality traits. Locations should not be an issue either (a priori); I’ve had close long-distance friendships which worked beautifully for me.\nAbout Us\nI would love to form a close friendship with 3-5 people, and one life partnership with a woman. If you want a shallower connection, that’s also okay; maybe we can still contribute to each other’s lives.\nI'm also looking for collaboration, whether on Compass or any other project which I would be aligned with.\nWhile some key relationship values, such as depth and trust, grow over time, there is one value which, I believe, should be there from the start: honesty. In this regard, please be honest about your intentions—which may include different types of relationships depending on how it evolves, and that’s okay.\nThings I'm currently exploring and I'd like to discuss with whoever is interested:\nPopulation ethics in utilitarianism (total view vs neutral / person affective, longtermism, What we owe the future from MacAskill)\nMoral realism vs anti-realism, the different sub types of anti-realism, mostly constructivism and non-cognitivism (Bertrand Russell, Sean Carroll)\nConsciousness, and whether the hard problem is really a problem\nDo multidisciplinary research / PhD across science and philosophy\nIf emotional intelligence, unlike IQ, is context-dependent (one can have high EI with one type of person, and low EI with another), how important is it to have high EI across all contexts? What proportion of EI is objective (high across all contexts)?\nEffective altruism\nDisclaimers\nThis document desperately lacks elaboration, emotions, and personal information for privacy reasons. I have no issue sharing about my life story, what I look like, what I feel and think, vulnerability, intimacy, and other personal features in private.\nEndorsements\nIf you know them, write something nice that adds to their profile."

      "fullText": "﻿I’m Mark, nice to meet you!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe basics   \r\n* 35 years old\r\n* Child-free, open to children\r\n* Located in East Anglia (England)\r\n* Non-smoker\r\n* Head of Support in the Education sector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me   \r\nI’ve lived in East Anglia now for just over 15 years and whilst I love it here, I’m absolutely willing to consider moving to different parts of the country. I have a dream to move to a remote Scottish island one day and have a little self-sustaining farm!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve been described by my friends as kind, selfless and intelligent. I am very curious to learn and to experience new things, I’m always looking for little trips away and new sports and activities to try!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI used to run my own music business in Norfolk, so have quite a few stories to tell about bands/artists I’ve met! Music has always been a big part of my life - I’m a 90s child but 80s-00s music is where I find myself most days! \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI very much enjoy cooking - it’s one of my passions. I make an excellent roast dinner and a Sunday isn’t complete without one! That being said, I enjoy going out to restaurants too - though nothing beats an amazing home cooked meal. Especially an autumnal crumble - can’t go wrong with an apple and blackberry crumble dessert!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI’d say my best personality feature is that I am a very caring person. I have a lot of pride in being there for people - being a good friend is important to me and similarly, being a good partner to someone is something I hold a lot of value in. I show my kindness through actions and words and I like that those in my life feel I am a positive presence in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for?\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for the type of person who would have one of these documents! Somebody who’s curious about the world, intelligent and is looking to explore life together.\r\n  \r\n I prioritise emotional connections with others ahead of physical, so I’d very much like to meet somebody who is also looking for an emotional connection and somebody to share experiences with. That doesn’t mean I’m not looking for a physical connection (as that’s important, too!); I just prioritise connecting with the person on an intellectual level as well!  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn terms of a partner, it would be great to meet somebody who is active, fun and whose idea of a good weekend is going for a walk somewhere along a beach, exploring a new city or getting lost in nature! Bonus points if you have a dog we can take for walks - I haven’t got a dog yet but would like to!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI’d probably describe myself as an introverted extrovert - I love doing new things, seeing new places etc but I’m definitely more of a ‘smaller crowds’ sort of person. My nightclub days are well behind my now, I’d much rather an evening walking to a country pub and sitting in front of a fire there with a board game and some great company!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI’m looking for someone who takes an interest in things - not necessarily being interested in the same sort of things as me, but who has a curious mind and enjoys learning about things. I’ve got an interest in space things (the Northern Lights, seeing comets etc) which pops up every so often so someone who’d enjoy hearing about random facts I learn would be ideal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’d be lovely to hear from you - I’m looking to make more connections generally in life, so even if not for a date you can never have too many friends, right? 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me at canariesfc@gmail.com and we can chat!"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\nDate Me Doc\nMade with\nDate Me Doc\nLast Updated Oct. 20, 2025\nBasic info\nName: Owen Murphy\nAge: 24\nPersonality: I usually get INTJ on Myers-Briggs, and I find descriptions like this one are fairly accurate to my impression of myself. I’m not socially anxious, but I can sometimes come across as a bit stoic and quiet since I don’t say much when I feel like I don’t have anything useful/interesting to contribute. Of course, if I’m with people I really click with, then I can quickly pick up speed with wordplay, puns, and general banter. Alternatively, if I get onto a topic I’m especially interested in, then I can also just go full lecture/professor mode and keep talking indefinitely (or as long as people are interested).\nAlso, as an aside: https://dynomight.net/in-defense-of-myers-briggs.html\nProfession: Software Developer\nLocation: Cambridge/Boston, MA\nOrientation: Hetero\nPolitics: Center-left\nPicture of me from the time I gave a presentation on Moral Uncertainty to the Berkeley Philosophy Forum\nALT\nI’m looking for a long-term relationship with a woman who\nShares my values, especially with respect to valuing honesty, truth-seeking, and compassion for others\nShares my interests, especially interest in self-improvement and in learning about ideas in philosophy, economics, math, computer science, and/or science in general from a somewhat skeptical/pragmatic perspective. Other shared interests in general nerd stuff would also be great\nIs someone I feel I can trust and be emotionally vulnerable with\nIs fun and funny enough to be my best friend\nIs in the approximate age range of 22-27\nIs nonreligious\nWould like to have kids in the future\nLess-basic info\nExercise\nFor exercise, I enjoy regularly working out (mostly calisthenics), going for runs in the local area, and playing pickleball with friends.\nHobbies\nMy most interesting hobby would probably be my blog/substack (https://ohmurphy.substack.com) where I write about ideas that I think are especially interesting and/or original. Topics tend to be economics-related, but occasionally I manage something math or computer science-related as well.\nIn addition to writing a blog, I also read a lot of blogs. I am currently subscribed to over 500 blogs on substack (only one paid though) and a few dozen more through RSS feeds. Obviously I don’t read most of them religiously (otherwise I would do little else), but I do still end up reading a fair number quite regularly. The content of the blogs varies, but they generally fit within the effective altruist/rationalist sphere or the academia/economics/statistics/math/software/data science/etc sphere.\nI occasionally manage to read a few academic nonfiction books. For example, see my semi-book review blog post on Who Gets What and Why: https://ohmurphy.substack.com/p/notes-on-reading-who-gets-what-and. However, these books tend to take a fair bit of focus and effort, so I don’t get through them very often.\nI love to read fiction, especially fantasy. The last few years, I have gotten somewhat hooked on reading webserials (often on royalroad.com). The result is that every few weeks I’ll end up spending a day or two just lying down and reading all the way through a new webserial I’ve come across until I reach the latest chapter. For example, on a recent weekend I started and reached the latest chapter of The Bell Tolls for Me. Since a few series I’ve read are still ongoing, I end up reading ~3-5 new chapters each week from webserials I’m caught up on. I also read non-webserial fantasy like the Stormlight Archive and the Dresden Files, but not as regularly.\nI like to play board games with friends, especially social deduction games. At the moment, I am a regular participant in local in-person games of Blood on the Clocktower (BotC), which is a game I particularly enjoy. In fact, I recently spent over ten hours straight playing BotC in-person and had a wonderful time.\nI used to listen to a lot of podcasts, but I’ve mostly replaced them with listening to substack posts. Now the main podcasts that I listen to are RPG ones like The Apocalypse Players, which is an extremely good Call of Cthulhu podcast. I do still listen to some others like The Studies Show though.\nRecently (in the last few months) I’ve joined the Fractal Boston community, where I have been attending weekly dinner parties and getting to regularly meet new and interesting people. I’m also hoping to join some of their community classes, once they start up again.\nThose are my more specific and consistent hobbies, but (of course) I also enjoy various other random activities, like watching videos and TV shows with others, playing through visual novels with friends while we voice the characters (I quite enjoy doing fun/silly voices), going out for a drink with friends, and just general walking/talking/hanging out.\nThere are also a few hobbies that I don’t currently engage in regularly, but that I’m looking to explore more in future. These include: dancing, singing, improv, and tabletop rpgs (I’ve played a few times, but not regularly).\nGeneral Media Interests\nA while ago I wrote up a list of entertainment that I enjoyed and posted it on my blog in case it would help me find new friends in Massachusetts (which I only recently moved to). I don’t think it is worth rewriting the whole thing here, so you can just look at it there instead: O.H. MurphyEntertainment/Media Recommendations​\nOne other item I did not include there, but which I have been quite enjoying are the ‘Seals are good’ channel’s youtube videos, which depict a hilarious alternate version of the star wars prequels that begins with “Anakin has a doctorate in Darth Plageius the Wise Studies” (playlist link) and quickly devolves from there in the best ways possible.\nContact Info\nIf, after reading this, you would like to get in touch, then please email me at ohmurphysf@gmail.com."

      "fullText": "Adam's date-me doc\nWho am I?\nAdam: Male, Straight, 6'2\", Monogamous, Wants Kids, Boston (but open to lots of travel initially), born 1993.\nadamjermyn@gmail.com\nI feel motivated by family, by curiosity, and by doing what I think is right:\nI chose to live in Boston to be close to family, even though this introduced significant challenges to my career.\nI studied Physics and Astronomy because I find awe and wonder in the natural world, and especially the stars, and have a deep curiosity about how it all works.\nThree years ago I left Astronomy to work on AI Safety after almost a decade of study and work because I think AI is going to change the world, and it's important to make sure that change is positive. I'm now a research lead on Anthropic's\nInterpretability team\n.\nPros of dating me\nI\nproduce\na lot of creative artifacts. From journal articles to blog posts to paintings, almost all of my time is spent creating something I can share with others.\nI'm really excited to have kids with the right partner, ideally in the next 3-5 years , and I'm genuinely eager to do half of the parenting work. My parents are also amazing with kids, and it's likely they'd be around and able to help (especially if we have kids on the sooner side).\nI'm happy and able to comfortably support a family financially, even a large one, on just my income. So while I'm very happy to share financial responsibility, I can also imagine a relationship with someone who wants to spend more time with the kids, or who wants to pursue a career for passion rather than pay.\nI care a lot about doing what I think is right, which includes being scrupulously honest and holding myself to a high standard of integrity.\nI genuinely delight in lifting my partner up. I have a strong supportive instinct, so I'd love to provide encouragement, coaching, and help in charting a course towards your hopes and dreams, and I'd love to have your help in turn with mine.\nI tend to see things that need to be done far in advance, and can do the research to make it happen even in difficult circumstances. For instance, at the height of the pandemic I wrote analyses of COVID testing\nprotocols\nand transmission mechanics that correctly predicted subsequent expert consensus several months in advance.\nI host a lot of recurring events for friends (boardgame nights, \"quiet reading & tea\" nights, bagel brunches on the weekends). I find hosting energizing and get a lot out of providing a \"third space\"\nfor community\n. A lot of my choices have been motivated by wanting to make this possible.\nI'm very agentic when it comes to my health and that of those around me (to the extent this is welcome). I've written\nliterature reviews\non medical questions for friends / partners who wanted help navigating unusual questions where it's otherwise hard to get actionable advice.\nCons\nI'm pretty self-reflective, which can sometimes tip into overthinking things I've said or done, or am planning to do. This comes up most in professional settings but you'll likely see it occasionally in a relationship too. I've made some progress on this but it's still something I'm actively working on.\nI spend a lot of time \"living in the future\" (e.g. anticipating what might happen, both positive and negative, related to above), and sometimes need help grounding in the moment. This is also something I have experience doing for friends / partners so I'm very happy to reciprocate if you need the same.\nI find conflict somewhat aversive, and have to push myself to engage in important disagreements outside of technical topics. I know conflict is important, and I can get myself to engage in difficult conversations when necessary, but I've historically been slow to do so. In the last year or so I've made a lot of progress on this, and I expect to keep getting better at it in the near future.\nAs a contrast to the last point, I really care about the truth, and am likely to push back on things I don't think are true in conversation, which can come across as disagreeable. Of course this same tendency can be a plus, since it means I try my best to be honest and act with integrity, and I work hard to update my views in the face of evidence.\nI get migraines. Untreated, these were very bad. With medication they're well-controlled, but I still try to avoid triggers like very loud environments and sleep deprivation. When I'm sick (e.g. with a cold) the medication is much less effective, and I'm reasonably likely to be totally out-of-commission 2-3 days out of a week-long illness. There are also occasionally times when I need to duck out of plans and find a dark/quiet place.\nVibes\nWe're more likely to be compatible if:\nYou're excited about the natural world\nand want to spend time in it. Think walks on beaches, easy-to-moderate hikes, botanical gardens, national parks, and the night sky. Hiking especially is something I do a lot, and being able to share that would mean a lot to me.\nYou're excited about some technical subject\n(science, math, economics, etc.). I really love talking with people who can teach me new things, or who can share in the joy of discovery together, or who're curious about these subjects. I'm truly delighted to spend an evening digging into a thorny question with a thought partner.\nYou value your own integrity\n, and know how to act on that. This might mean being truth-seeking, forming your own moral views, setting boundaries, and advocating for what you want/need.\nYou bring intentionality to the relationship.\nCreating dedicated time and space for connection—whether that's regular check-ins, rituals we build together, or simply being present with each other—matters a lot to me.\nSome Important Things\nI'm monogamous.\nI'm looking to have biological kids. I'm flexible about timelines, and want to be sure to build a strong and close relationship first. My guess is that means somewhere in the next 3-5 years, but I could imagine moving faster if that feels right. I'd want us to be proactive about fertility considerations (like egg freezing if needed) so we have options. Being on the same page about this is really important.\nI'm politically moderate / a \"classical liberal\". If you're looking for someone who's far left or far right, that's not me (and I have many views that don't fall neatly on the left-right spectrum).\nI'm open to starting a relationship long-distance with regular visits. If things are going well though I'd like to find a way to co-locate / be in the same city. I'm pretty firmly rooted in Boston, so while it's not impossible that I could move, it's also not very likely.\nMy work is based in SF and I have to periodically travel there (currently 1 week / 2 months, though the cadence is somewhat flexible). If you wanted to join me on some of those trips that would be very exciting.\nWhat I do in my free time\nReading\nBoardgames (Spirit Island is my favorite, more generally I really like cooperative games)\nVideogames (mostly Halo, some Factorio)\nWalks / Hikes\nTravel (especially to the American West)\nExercise (I got really into strength training during the pandemic and have kept that up)\nHosting\nSinging / voice lessons\nLiterature reviews / trying to figure out something that confuses me about the world\nThings I'm not into\nI don't smoke or use any illegal drugs. I also drink very little (it makes me sleep poorly). I don't mind if you drink in moderation. Smoking (including non-tobacco products) is a dealbreaker for me.\nI don't mind cats, but wouldn't want to have one. There's a lot of risk of parasites with a cat in the home that I'm just not keen on.\nSome Random Facts About Me\nI put a lot of thought into designing my spaces to be functional but also warm, and I find it pretty easy to keep them neat/organized. My current home has a lot of hard wood, big windows, bookshelves, seating space, rugs, and indoor trees.\nI enjoy Marmite and chutneys (separately).\nI've hosted a (mostly) weekly boardgame night for over two years.\nI once walked 17 miles from Cambridge, England to the city of Ely. Along the way a cow chased me away because I got too close to her calf.\nI'm mostly not excited about dogs, but would be very excited to have a Golden Doodle specifically. They're just so... friendly and grounding and fun. The further a dog gets from \"Golden Doodle\" energy the less excited I am.\nMany of the fossils in my fossil collection are ones I found in the ground in England (oh and also, I have a fossil collection!).\nWhat am I looking for?\nI'm looking for a long-term romantic partner to build a life and raise a family with.\nBuilding a life together means being a team—spending substantial time together, sharing our inner worlds, making sense of the world as thought partners, and navigating challenges side-by-side.\nIn practice, this might look like:\nWeekend mornings with coffee and long conversations, maybe followed by time at the gym or going on a hike together.\nDedicating time regularly to ask \"how are you?\" and really hold space for the answer, whether it's joyous, difficult, or somewhere in between.\nEvening conversations where we process our days and think through the implications of our work together.\nSupporting each other's growth and fulfillment—not just cheerleading, but actively helping chart a course toward what matters and coaching each other through challenges.\nHosting brunch for friends on Sunday, building community together.\nA balance of intentional together time and comfortable quiet downtime.\nKids\nI’m really excited about having kids. My ideal is probably 3-4, though the common advice of “see how you feel after each one” makes a lot of sense to me—it’s genuinely hard to predict how life will go! What matters is that I’m starting from a place of wanting a larger family, and I’d hope that’s something you’re keen on too.\nParenting\nFor me a huge part of the point of having kids is being actively involved and present in their lives, so I'd expect to spend a lot of my time/energy parenting (potentially including home schooling, if we decided that made the most sense), and want a partner who's motivated by the same. I'm genuinely eager to do half of the parenting work.\nCommunication\nI have a pretty direct communication style in partnership. I usually know what I want and ask for it straightforwardly. If you know what you want and ask for it I'll be very receptive to that!\nI also have a pretty good memory, supplemented by a spaced repetition system, so if you tell me a preference/want/need you have there's an excellent chance I'll remember it from that point on.\nOn the flip side, early on in knowing someone I'm not especially good at picking up on some more subtle forms of communication, but as I get to know someone (especially a partner) I get better at picking up on what's going on with them, and in the long run can be pretty good at this.\nPhysical Intimacy\nPhysical intimacy is a really important part of what I'm looking for, both at first and in the long run. If it's not important to you or doesn't sound like what you want long-term, we're probably not a good match!\nI know these things don't just magically work, and that connection is something you build with time and care and trust. I'm very here for that. What matters is that we're both people who actively desire and prioritize physical connection as an ongoing part of our relationship, so that we can prioritize finding ways to connect physically and treat that as being as central as e.g. emotional connection.\nBeyond that I'll be excited to hear about your preferences and find things we're both keen on. Communication is important to me, and I really appreciate when my partners ask for what they want. I'm also pretty open to exploring here, and won't be put off by you asking for something new!\nIntellectual Connection\nIntellectual partnership is really important to me. It's part of how I feel seen and secure—knowing we have a shared way of making sense of the world. I love conversations that go deep, whether we're teaching each other from our different domains or figuring something out together. You don't need to work in AI or physics, but you do need to be someone who finds joy in engaging with complex ideas and being a thought partner.\nCoordination\nI come from a family of planners, so I tend to spot things that need doing quite a ways off and plan accordingly. I also tend to get anxious when it feels like my partner and I aren't on the same page about where we're going / what we're aiming for long-term (even if we don't stick to those plans / even as life twists and turns).\nYou don't need to be a natural planner yourself, but it's important that you're willing to engage in those conversations with me - to think together about our direction and make plans as a team. If the thought of having regular check-ins about where we're headed (long-term and short-term) doesn't appeal to you, we're probably not a good match!\nMoney\nI think money is a resource we can use to fulfill our values, including personal consumption but also values like altruism and community. I don't think it's bad to spend money, and I don't think frugality is a virtue (beyond the virtue of living within our means).\nOn a practical level, I'm fortunate to have a job that means I can comfortably support a family financially on just my income. I'm very happy to share financial responsibility, and at the same time I can imagine a relationship with someone who wants to spend more time with the kids, or who wants to study full-time, or who wants to pursue a career for passion rather than pay.\nFamily\nFamily is important to me. I grew up as the youngest of three and have a large extended family of cousins (mostly in New England). I have really fond memories of large gatherings at my grandparents’ home, and that’s something I’d love for my kids to get to experience.\nThese days we do large family vacations together, as well as smaller gatherings, and spending time with my family is one of the most rewarding things I do. It's important to me for you to join me in this (and my family is really, truly welcoming!), and I'd be excited to join you with your family too.\nReligion\nI think there's a lot of wisdom in religious traditions, and also there are a lot of restrictions in the details of observance that can run counter to my values, so I tend to err on the side of less observance and more \"spirit of the law\".\nI was raised in a conservative Jewish household, and identify as atheist but culturally Jewish. I'd be happy to make a mostly-secular home together (which could incorporate traditions from other religions), or something in the \"reform-to-conservative\" Jewish spectrum. So e.g. I love to host and attend Shabbat dinners, I think the high holidays are a great time for family gatherings, and I think there's a lot of beautiful music in the liturgy. At the same time many of the specifics of observance run counter to my values so I steer clear of those (e.g. not travelling on Shabbat makes it hard to see family, not using a phone on Shabbat is dangerous if an emergency arises, etc.). If strict observance is important to you we're probably not a good fit.\nMy kitchen currently is kosher (non-hechsher dairy) as a practical matter, because that makes it easier to host and contribute to meals\nwith community\n, but I’m definitely open to changing that if it conflicts with your values.\nAlso: I believe quite strongly in a material universe, and would find it difficult to have a partner who believes that the world is influenced by the supernatural (e.g. deities, magic, etc.). So much of my worldview is built on materialism and physical reductionism that I would find it hard to live with integrity in close partnership with someone who doesn't share that understanding of the world.\nGiving credit where it’s due: I got the idea to write this doc and a lot of inspiration around e.g. what to include from my friend & colleague Chris Olah, who wrote a similar doc for himself several years ago."

Rationalist friends (or a companion) with utilitarian-ish or sympathetic views.\r\nPhilosophy & Me\r\nThree passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.\r\nThe eloquent Bertrand Russell (who penned the above at 84) was my gateway to philosophy (and for a fun contrast, The Good Place my gateway to ethics). I’ve always liked learning, but only philosophy has taught, and continues to teach, me to reconsider my epistemic limits and moral blind spots, to resist the norm of prejudging issues and perspectives, and to respect cognitive diversity.\r\nI don’t live and breathe philosophy, but I find myself on a closer wavelength to those on whom it has made a similar impact.\r\nLifestyle\r\nTraits:\r\n* 🐢 Introverted and more comfortable in cozy places and 1-on-1 chinwags than in large crowds (though I love a jaunt through the city).\r\n* 🌱 Active, not athletic, and health-conscious, 5’9”. I have no experience with drugs or drinking, though not for highly principled reasons.\r\n* 💞 Eager to banter with and support those whom I care about.\r\nHobbies:\r\n* 🎸 Guitar and singing.\r\n* 📚 Reading, mainly philosophy, short stories, psychology (Jonathan Haidt, Joshua Greene), and politics (in moderation). Currently enjoying a book on AI alignment and writing an overview of theories of consciousness!\r\n* 🍛 Cooking.\r\n* 🎮 Video games.\r\n* 💻 UX design.\r\n* 👐 Occasional volunteering.\r\nAmbitions:\r\n* Graduated and have my sights on a philosophy MA next. In the long term, I’m partial to teaching and/or doing public philosophy as I’ve done before, supplementing with UX work if needed. Above all I hope to meet a special someone with whom I can devote time to mutual growth and advocating.\r\nNon-negotiables\r\n* 🫶 Empathy and open-mindedness (i.e., non-dogmatism), especially in communication. I strive always to be nonjudgy and an active listener.\r\nBeliefs\r\n* Value Realism. There are objectively good and bad things. It’s common to misinterpret this view as necessitating a commitment to a free-floating abstractum, goodness (or The Good) and the like. Not so. Value is a property of things, like squareness and loudness are properties of bread and bellbirds, respectively; affirming these properties doesn’t imply belief in a free-floating squareness or loudness. Acknowledging this point preempts the oft-made “argument” for skepticism that, since we don’t perceive abstracta, it’s dubious how we could “see” the goodness or badness of anything; the proper response here is that while we don’t see moral value itself, we see instances thereof, akin to seeing tori in donuts or finitude in a life.\r\n* Utilitarianism. As for my view of what instances value, I think feelings or experiences do, informally speaking. This is, in effect, hedonism, a nicely parsimonious theory of value that, when conjoined with other plausible tenets, yields classical utilitarianism—I believe the most plausible moral theory. Some views I consider allies: impartialism, suffering-focused ethics, “deontology for people, utilitarianism for animals.”\r\n* Anti-speciesism. Of the moral blind spots I’ve been led to reconsider, perhaps none do I regret failing to notice more than the belief that our species is justified in mistreating others if and because ours is more powerful, intelligent, or whatever. This type of sophistry runs through numerous exclusionary ideologies–male supremacy, racial supremacy, tribalism, Aryanism–and should, I believe, be laid to rest. There are rational, logical grounds for extending moral concern to all experiencing beings (but know I don’t judge anyone for failing to act consistently with their values; nobody’s perfect, least of all me).\r\n* Politics. My politics square with my ethics (e.g. pro-foreign aid, pro-gender equality); as general descriptors, ‘democrat,’ ‘liberal,’ and ‘progressive’ fit me!\r\n* Religion. I’m an atheist—though I do admit the existence of some intriguing arguments for a creator! But even if I did become more sympathetic to theism, it’s unlikely it would influence my ethics or lifestyle.\r\n* Spirituality v. ineffability. Many hold the intuition that there exists a “higher power” that is not necessarily God. While I don’t think this is unreasonable, I confess I cannot relate and so remain skeptical (as I likewise am of claims that meditation/drugs/NDE’s can transmit spiritual knowledge). To be clear, I emphatically accept that certain states (e.g. love, grief) are inexplicable and that you can reasonably believe something even if that thing isn’t scientifically verifiable/testable. However I resist the idea that one’s altered state can “show them” a posteriori spiritual truths (unless “spiritual” is used loosely like “sublime”). Perhaps this is close-minded of me. Ultimately though, I’d prefer (more so for a potential companion) that any gaps between our beliefs and formative experiences can be adequately overcome. (If you are spiritual, I’ll do my best to be understanding, not resistant.) Perhaps this should be our first conversation starter (;\r\nIf you’d like to get to know me more (even if only to gain a chat/debate pal), reach out via the Contact Form, please and tysm 😇\r\n(Recent)"

      "fullText": "﻿Kayla\r\nKayla\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a woman in my late thirties living in the Maryland suburbs of DC, looking for a man for marriage, but not strict monogamy. Open to moving under the right circumstances. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm like\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a lawyer and part-time editor in fields that straddle the STEM/humanities gap as well as the rat/normie gap. I’m not religious and lean libertarian. I’m fairly disciplined and exercise daily—my favorite forms of exercise are yoga and walking in the woods, but I also lift, run, etc. Relatedly, I’m a planner and usually scheduled rather than spontaneous. I’m 5’5”, ~140 lbs, with very fair skin and green eyes. I mostly wear dresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn weekends, I might see friends or have people over, go to a restaurant, cocktail bar or the theatre. I am friendly and interested in people, but not very talkative—calm and reserved more than bubbly or smiley. I like Renaissance art, music, and poetry. Also roots music. I’m not arrogant, I just read more than you. Will be eternally grateful if you take me to see Titus Andronicus.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm an amateur naturalist and know a little bit about plants, birds, animals, and mushrooms. I spend more time outside than the average person. I have two cats and avoid dogs. Sometimes I go on road trips to places like the Shenandoah Valley or Canaan Valley, which often involves hiking or biking. I like to see new places and eat new animals. I don't mind ending up covered with dust or swamp muck or colorful juices from a plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly my most extreme quality is openmindedness about food. I find it hard to understand how someone could be hungry and still turn down food. It might be difficult to date someone with a very limited diet. I also wouldn't want to date a heavy drug user, although I drink (and that is hypocritical, but the law is what it is). A close-up of words\n\nDescription automatically generated \r\n\r\n\r\nLists of adjectives are boring, so here is a word cloud about me. Ask me about: Bike to Work Day, etiquette, critical psychiatry.\r\n________________\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately I'm looking for someone to marry and raise a child with. With a partner, I enjoy sharing food, texting a lot, psychoanalyzing myself and others, and really just a lot of touching.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like men. As a rule. The ideal man reads, communicates explicitly, and works out. I appreciate nonconformity and people who are willing to have hard conversations. Beards, tattoos, and gun ownership are attractive. People who are overly polished or excessively nice tend to repel me. I prefer someone who is more extroverted than I am, who can also tolerate my tendency to wander off on my own. Must laugh at my jokes. I like people who are game for a wide range of experiences and interested in many things. \r\n\r\n\r\nThings I'd like to do with a partner:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Blackwater Falls wildflower pilgrimage\r\n* Cook for each other and watch cartoons\r\n* Walk across England\r\n* Finally visit Yellowstone\r\n* American Shakespeare Center road trip\r\n\r\n\r\nYou’re probably wondering what “not strictly monogamous” means. I want to have a lifelong, committed partnership that each of us prioritizes above all else. Sexual exclusivity is negotiable, but I have a hard time with the part of monogamy that manifests as constantly tripping over an invisible network of unspoken expectations. I would do best with someone who is naturally low on jealousy and willing to treat jealousy as a challenge to be overcome together, not an emergency that instantly voids all previous agreements. \r\n\r\n\r\nExplicit communication is also important to me (good description here). It’s going to be hard for me to figure out what you want if you’re not telling me in words. \r\n\r\n\r\nReasons not to date me (non-comprehensive)\r\n\r\n\r\n* People tell me I’m hard to read. I might not signal what I’m thinking or going to do. You might need to ask rather than assuming I’ll volunteer information.\r\n* I’m not a good fit for someone who wants clingy or effusive qualities.\r\n* I’m divorced.\r\n* I don’t mind kissing, but I don’t really enjoy it.\r\n* I will want to talk over my worries, and my worries are sometimes nonsensical. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have always found it easy to shock and dismay people just by going about my life and saying things I think are obvious. So someone who is not so easily shocked or intimidated would be preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Google form or @caryatis A person sitting on a log\n\nDescription automatically generated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A person smiling for a picture\n\nDescription automatically generated \r\nThe blonde did not last.\r\n\r\n\r\n A person standing on rocks\n\nDescription automatically generated \r\nAfter taking this photo I nervously climbed into the cave to look at sea stars.  \r\n  \r\nI appreciate rural America.

I really want to start a family and I’m looking for the right person to do that with. I’m looking for a partner to have kids with; if you’re interested in something else, I’m flattered, but that’s not my focus right now. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasics about me:\r\n* I’m 38 years old\r\n* Pretty straight\r\n* Currently live in the East Bay but open to relocating under the right circumstances\r\n* Originally from the Philadelphia area, moved to the Bay two years ago. Have also lived periods of my life and feel deeply connected to NYC and Baltimore\r\n* Never been married\r\n* Want to have kids and to that end, have frozen eggs\r\n\r\n\r\nDeeper things about me:\r\n* I’m a community builder. I love co-hosting events and bringing together groups of people who might not otherwise come together. I’ve hosted Shabbat meals that have manifested in two marriages!\r\n* Connection oriented. I care deeply about my relationships with others. \r\n* Spiritually oriented. Professionally, I’m a rabbi. Of course it’s a longer story but at the heart of it, I became a rabbi because I like teaching, counseling, community building, and religious/spiritual questions. Happy to tell you more in person about what it entails. \r\n* Self-reflective and growth-oriented\r\n* Intellectually curious\r\n* Good with kids. I teach a unique Hebrew school program to a group of 8-10 year olds, and I love the chance to help kids develop on their spiritual journeys.\r\n* Embodied–while I tend to spend my professional life doing a lot of cognitively-oriented work, I’m happiest when I’m moving my body or engaging with my senses\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies: \r\n* I love spending as much time outside as possible. I most routinely go on hikes with my dog but I love dabbling in other outdoor activities like backpacking and kayaking when I get a chance. I love trying new things—some things currently on my list include windsurfing, classic surfing, and horseback riding.\r\n* I’m a former theater kid and still love going to see performances of all sorts. I love using theater games and skills in my work life, and I might get back into it recreationally at some point. \r\n* Since moving to the Bay, I’ve been exploring partner dancing. In particular, I enjoy Fusion and Contra. I’m not particularly talented at it but it brings me a lot of joy and has been a fun way to build community.\r\n* I’m an amateur climber and runner. I do these things for my health but they’re not things I’m particularly ambitious about. \r\n* Things I’d like to do more of: reading, writing, art making, cooking.\r\n* Currently perfecting my coffee-banana smoothie recipe\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for:\r\n* Someone who is excited about having a family\r\n* Someone who is interested in emotions. They’re a big part of my life.\r\n* Someone who is intellectually curious. I love discussing ideas and learning new things.\r\n* Doesn’t have to be Jewish but someone who is interested in engaging spiritually and is a little curious about Judaism at least\r\n* Someone who is sex positive\r\n* Someone who cares about having a positive impact on the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould be great:\r\n* Someone who likes the outdoors and being active\r\n* Someone who likes wordplay\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I hope for out of a life together:\r\n* Love and affection\r\n* Much time for play, fun, and silliness (i’m really into this kind of thing)\r\n* But also committed to collaboration on the domestic tasks and errands of daily life (hopefully with lots of wide-ranging conversation and dance breaks)\r\n* Conflict that is respectful and patient and is an opportunity to deepen the relationship\r\n* Developing little traditions (religious or not) that remind us to appreciate ourselves, each other, our community, and our world\r\n* Working together to foster connection to greater community\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat my friends say about me:\r\n* Incredibly infectious smile\r\n* Bold but thoughtful\r\n* Compassionate and tender-hearted\r\n* Is sensitive and attuned in a way that helps others feel more present and get in touch with their own sensitivity\r\n* Exceptional listener, sits with discomfort and comfortable with silences and pauses\r\n* Deeply curious about the world\r\n* Loves words and wordplay, will care about why you chose a word or a thought and what it means\r\n* Has a friendly, lazy hypoallergenic little dog named Arlene (after the dog in a favorite children’s book)\r\nSome dates that would excite me:\r\n* Going to the farmer’s market or Berkeley Bowl and talking about the produce\r\n* Splitting an unusual pastry at a bakery\r\n* Sipping tea or a weird coffee drink\r\n* Any kind of hike\r\n* Any kind of public art\r\n* Anything else that involves moving our bodies\r\nIf you think you might be a match, please email me at rory.katz [at] gmail.com!"

(\nwhat is a date me doc?\n)\nGeorge Wang\n31 / male / 6'1\"\nLocation:\nSF (flexible)\nRelationship type:\nStraight, monogamous\nKids:\nMaybe? Ask me about it\nMy pronouns are he/him but they could be all/yours :)\nMy love language is sending people more blog posts / essays than anyone can reasonably be expected to read\nAbout me\nOne of my more load-bearing beliefs is that the world is fundamentally malleable to our actions. That the world can be a better place, that we have the power to improve it, and that\nwe should\ntry\n.\nThe main way I currently relate to this is through technological progress. I think AI is going to make the next decade\nreally weird\n, and not all in good ways. As soon as I was convinced this was true, I dropped what I was doing to\nfocus on making this societal transition safer\n. This was a difficult decision with various sacrifices, the most legible of which was a ~75% pay cut (I'm lucky to have financial stability from some earlier successes), but I think this was the right thing to do and I'm glad I did.\nAnother of my defining values is growth: I see myself as a constant work in progress. This means many things to me — being a better friend, a better partner, a better citizen. It means being a sharper scientist as much as it means healing old emotional wounds, and it means developing better habits as much as it means figuring out how to relate to my existential angst.\nThe way I move through and understand the world is fairly\nBay Area rationalist\ncoded, which sometimes makes me seem like a system-2-robot kind of person, but I think I have at least as much system-1-hopeless-idealist in me.\n(more recently on a \"postrat\" arc, though I kinda think the distinction is wrong? anyways, mostly this looks like getting much more interested in buddhism)\nI take commitments seriously, which might come off as \"reliable\" to some people and \"annoyingly conscientious\" to others.\nThe world is full of side quests and I regularly get nerd-sniped by them. I've built an automated arbitrage bot for\nMtG:O\n(and eventually got banned 😬), dabbled in sports betting, made a couple of\nsmall games\n, and occasionally drop everything I'm doing to chase down alpha in financial markets.\nI'm a bit of a dork and love games. One of my favorite framing of games is as\nart working in the medium of agency\n. I see games as a place to be playful, to be creative, to laugh, to cry, to feel both joy and fear, to compete, and to face challenges and overcome them.\nIf you like my writing, you'll probably like talking to me. A few that I like that aren't too domain specific:\nMy PhD cost me $1.17M (but I'd do it again)\n,\nSharing is caring\n,\nNavigating burnout\nAbout you\nThese are things I'm fairly sure I want:\nYou have strong values. We don't have to share all of them, but there are things that matter to you that you'd defend (they don't have to be grand, world-shattering things).\nYou're proactive about shaping your life. When you run into problems or see opportunities, you jump in.\nYou're kind and empathetic towards others. You try even when it's hard, including those you might not personally like or agree with.\nYou're deeply curious about the world. You care about what's true and want to learn together.\nYou're playful! Fun is a terminal value :)\n(To be clear, I'm not perfect at all of these myself!)\nAbout... us? 👉👈\nEarly dates might be activities where it's easy to talk at the same time: hikes, bouldering, board games, cooking dinner together, etc. A lot of early bonding happens through talking and texting for me.\nAfter we're a bit more comfortable, we might hang out more frequently, stay the night regularly, and text throughout the day about\nincreasingly mundane things\n(live-tweeting your life to someone is a real love language, fight me). I also enjoy just being in the same room, so if you also work remotely, we might cowork together often.\nLong-term, I'd like to live together and build our relationship into a source of mutual growth. It sounds super cliche but I mean it sincerely – I'd love to have a partnership where we keep inspiring each other to be better. I also travel a decent amount for work reasons (mostly conferences), but usually in great places to visit (last year was unusually travel-heavy, but I visited Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Melbourne, and the Bay Area). It's always nice to tack some extra time on either end, and a travel partner would be even better!\nI have an okay amount of social energy but am more introvert than extrovert and have decided that I mostly don't enjoy activities that involve lots of noise and not much personal space (concerts, clubs, etc). There are some exceptions, but in general I wouldn't expect this to be the kind of thing we regularly do together.\nI do like trips outdoors and would love to camp / hike / climb together!\nwe could\nboth\nbe laying here, dying of heat exhaustion\ntogether\nPossible dealbreakers?\nI don't politically identify as far left or far right. Socially, I tend to be more progressive, but otherwise I have somewhat scattered political positions.\nI'm not religious. I respect those who have deeply held religious beliefs, but this  probably means we understand the world in very fundamentally different ways.\nI lean towards lower thresholds for sensitivity to disgust. The kinds of compromises I try to aim for seemed to generally be fine in past relationships (and at least one partner was more germophobic than me), but if you have particularly high thresholds for disgust, this might generate friction.\nWhat next?\nThis is a fairly curated window into who I am, and reality is always more complicated. I don't know what the right discount factor is, but you should apply at least a little.\nIf you still feel interested, then reach out! Yes, you reading this doc. If you're not sure, please err on the side of getting in contact, that's what this thing is for! The downside might be a small time cost, and the upside is hugely positive for both of us. Don't leave that +EV on the table.\nEmail me\n, message me on\nTwitter\n, or ask a mutual friend to introduce us. No need for it to be a big deal either, just say hi and we can go from there!\nThis Is My True Name © 2025\nSign up\nPowered by Ghost"

      "fullText": "﻿Connections with Martin\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m always looking for ways to improve my life, and I believe that a few more close connections would greatly contribute to it—and, hopefully, to the life of others as well! \r\nI created this document with the prospect to form close friendships / relationships with like-minded people. If you relate to what I wrote below, I'd love to connect! You can simply contact me through this Connection Form.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a man in his late 20s speaking English and French fluently. I’m currently in Europe, but I have recently lived in the US (for 4 years) and India (for 6 months).\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Values\r\nHighly stable and non-negotiable guiding principles that shape my worldview, decisions, and moral framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Intellectual curiosity with rational integrity: I evaluate beliefs against evidence and enjoy conversations that challenge and expand my thinking.\r\n* Ethical responsibility / Utilitarian-leaning ethics: I consciously act to reduce suffering and improve outcomes on a large scale—through causes like animal welfare, climate change, AI safety, and global poverty.\r\n* Emotional stability and resilience: I remain calm under stress, self-soothe effectively, and approach conflicts with reason rather than panic or overreaction.\r\n* Deep, loving relationships: I thrive in profound 1-on-1 connections where accountability, honesty, and mutual growth are prioritized.\r\n* Growth-oriented conflict resolution: I engage in solution-focused dialogue, tolerate relational discomfort, and prioritize repair over avoidance.\r\n* Integrity & deliberateness: I aim to live according to my principles and consciously cultivate trust, depth, and clarity during relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nTolerance for differences: I’m very willing to connect with people who fit more than 70% of these values, embracing trade-offs and growth together.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle & Secondary Values\r\nTraits or principles that matter to me, but are negotiable or context-dependent. Mostly applying to life partnerships—not friendships.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife Vision & Practicalities:\r\n* Geography: I enjoy living in Europe but am open to relocate if circumstances align.\r\n* Family: I’d like 1–2 children within roughly 5–10 years, depending on mutual readiness.\r\n* Career / lifestyle: I support a partner’s work and ambitions, as long as we can spend meaningful time together (2+ hours most days).\r\n* Financial approach: I live frugally, saving or donating the rest, but am comfortable if my partner spends more on things meaningful to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment & Intimacy Needs\r\n* Conflict & repair: I notice when someone is hurt, but I do not chase them if they withdraw. I prefer calm, constructive conversations when both sides are ready. Because I'll care about you, I'll express it when I think you may be wrong—at the same time, I'll always have your back.\r\n* Emotional intelligence: I’m aware of my emotions and take time to process before responding, which helps me stay calm in tense moments. I try to express my feelings honestly, listen carefully to understand others, and take responsibility when I misstep. I believe that, with mutual effort, we can keep strengthening our emotional intelligence and connection as a healthy, securely attached couple.\r\n* Emotional expressiveness: More through words, modest body language and thoughtful gifts than grand gestures.\r\n* Preferred intimacy style: I enjoy direct and meaningful connections—long dedicated conversations over frequent, shallow texts. I seek a monogamous relationship.\r\n* Openness: Although I respect those who explore radical openness and playful experimentation, that is not my orientation. I do not engage much in norm-challenging lifestyles or social experiments—particularly around sex, relationships, or identity. I value seriousness, loyalty, and stability in these domains and approach them with depth rather than playfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle Habits & Daily Rhythms:\r\n* Dietary choices: Mostly vegan; I strongly value sensitivity to animal well-being.\r\n* Sleep & energy patterns: Typically 11pm–8am; similar routines are a plus.\r\n* Exercise & health: Small-group activities several times per week. Open to mental health practices to improve relationships and wellbeing.\r\n* Social engagement: Few close friendships; comfortable connecting with more socially active or community-involved partners.\r\n* Family engagement: Average.\r\n* Minimalism: I live a simple and non-performative life without clutter, in order to focus on what truly matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional & Cognitive Style:\r\n* Humor: Mix of wit, playful absurdity, and sarcasm.\r\n* Tolerance for uncertainty: Comfortable with ambiguity, but appreciate clear plans when possible.\r\n* Romantic philosophy: Love grows deliberately; romance and thoughtful gestures (e.g., poems) are enjoyable once fundamental compatibilities are aligned.\r\n* Role expectations: Prefer equal partnership, but open to specialization if mutually desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterests & Activities\r\nActivities or pursuits I enjoy but that don’t define my ethics or essential lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Intellectual pursuits: Reading nonfiction, exploring philosophy, science, history, and practical wisdom; hands-on learning through building and fixing things.\r\n* Deep conversation: Intense, thoughtful dialogue with like-minded people.\r\n* Optimization & personal growth: Exploring methods to improve life, productivity, and learning practices.\r\n* Nature & mindfulness: Contemplative walks or time in natural landscapes; pausing to observe wildlife or scenery inspires awe.\r\n* Physical activities: Running, biking, swimming, weightlifting—often integrated with mindfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluences\r\nContents that majorly influenced my worldview.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks:\r\n* Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman    \r\n* The Art of Living a Meaningless Existence - Robert Pantano\r\n* Le Petit Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\r\n* L’étranger - Albert Camus\r\n* Existential Physics - Sabine Hossenfelder\r\n* The Big Picture - Sean Carroll\r\n* Doing Good Better - William MacAskill\r\n* Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman\r\n* Waking Up - Sam Harris\r\n* Deep Work - Cal Newport\r\n* Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari\r\n* Being the Change - Peter Kalmus\r\n\r\n\r\nYouTube channels:\r\n* The Pursuit of Wonder\r\n* Kurzgesagt\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to send recommendations or discuss any content you like!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout You\r\n\r\n\r\nTo an imperfect extent, I like who I am and what I do, and would like to see it in the people around me. So, I’m mostly looking for people who identify—at least partially—with the description above and would enjoy the same activities. I believe in growth and potential; so I embrace people who are not there yet (so am I) but have, deep inside, the intention to reach it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as you fit some of the description, relationships, to me, transcend gender, age, culture, financial situation, or any other socio-demographic factors; please reach out to me regardless of your situation if you relate to my personality traits. Locations should not be an issue either (a priori); I’ve had close long-distance friendships which worked beautifully for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to form a close friendship with 3-5 people, and one life partnership with a woman. If you want a shallower connection, that’s also okay; maybe we can still contribute to each other’s lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile some key relationship values, such as depth and trust, grow over time, there is one value which, I believe, should be there from the start: honesty. In this regard, please be honest about your intentions—which may include different types of relationships depending on how it evolves, and that’s okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimers\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document desperately lacks elaboration, emotions, and personal information for privacy reasons. I have no issue sharing about my life story, what I look like, what I feel and think, vulnerability, intimacy, and other personal features in private."

      "fullText": "﻿Last updated Aug 25 2025  \r\nDemographics: male, 25 (born 1999), hetero, SF, work in tech. (boring!) \r\n\r\n\r\nFun facts and unsubtle flexes\r\n* I like to run barefoot. If you see me in GGP give me a high five! \r\n* I love foraging for wild plants. In college I was frequently caught eating wild greens growing outside the lecture halls. \r\n* I’m obsessed with Astral Codex Ten (see my favorite authors).\r\n* I occasionally write on Substack, though I don’t claim it’s any good (favorite post here).\r\n* I’m vegetarian – I recently ended four years of veganism :( \r\n* I meditate a fair amount - I’ve done two ten-day silent retreats. Occasionally I faint while doing breathwork. \r\n* I have four sisters :) \r\n* I love teaching - in college I TAed five different classes and was a frosh RA. \r\n* My first job was trading bonds at Jane Street and my current one is working at an AI startup. I am prone to nerding out about math, AI, and finance.\r\n* I occasionally freedive - I’ve been down 80 feet and held my breath for four minutes. \r\n* I’m a certified yoga instructor and want to start teaching in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship values\r\nHigh trust: I will assume that you mean well, are telling the truth, and have my best interests at heart until I see overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I have no interest in keeping score on who pays the most or does the most chores or emotional labor.[1]\r\nDirectness: If you’re weighing whether to be polite or to be frank, I usually prefer the latter. You can tell me an outfit is ugly even if I didn’t ask. We all want to be both kind and honest all the time, but I’m not smooth enough to achieve that. I will be forthcoming, occasionally at the expense of tact. \r\nHonesty: I’m disciplined about never lying or deceiving, even when I really want to to save someone’s feelings. I hope you’ll do the same. \r\nIndependence: I am charismatic and extrovert-presenting, but by nature am an introvert and value my alone time. If me going off the grid for ten days for a meditation retreat once every year or two would be extremely burdensome for you, we might not be a great match.[2] \r\n\r\n\r\nThings I’m attracted to (I think these all describe me too, maybe that makes me narcissistic oops)\r\nEccentricity, Confidence: Most people think you’re weird or wrong about topics you’ve thought hard about. You occasionally stick out in crowds and happily fail as you try new things. \r\nEmbodiment: You dance, meditate, sing, smell plants you pass on the street, jump in cold bodies of water, close your eyes to eat, enjoy physical touch\r\nIntelligence: You understand things intuitively across domains. I learn new things from you.\r\nAltruism: You treat strangers as friends as yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential dealbreakers\r\nPolitics: Hard to pin down, but words I occasionally identify with are liberal, rationalist, libertarian. I don’t care what your politics are, but I certainly care that you have intelligent opinions and are fun to talk to. \r\nKids: I’m 95% sure I want kids, open to biological or adopting, and would be pretty excited about having them sooner rather than later (looking at you, women a couple years older than me!) \r\nPolyamory: I’ve never been in a polyamorous relationship and I’m excited to try one, but if you’re monogamous that’s also great. I can’t bring myself to be jealous, and so won’t care if you’re dating other people or exploring feelings for another person while we’re together. I will encourage and support you in whatever endeavours bring you joy! But I can’t imagine being in one committed relationship and feeling like I have time and energy for another. If you’re monogamous, all I ask is that you trust me to set boundaries with other women and tell you my honest feelings. \r\nReligion: I’m not religious, but it’s fine if you are. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn a first date we could:\r\n* Have a picnic on the beach\r\n* Go for a hike or jog\r\n* Assign one another a favorite essay to read and discuss \r\n* Have a home-cooked meal at one of our apartments\r\n* Play laser tag \r\n* Bring friends on a double-date\r\n\r\n\r\nContact info: (650) 474 9283. robbiethompson2018@gmail.com. No socials. Bonus points if you reach out with a date me doc of your own! Some pics I use on the apps\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] Trust is earned by, eg, paying for things and doing emotional labor - I am excited to do these things! The important bit is to treat every interaction like a gift and not a transaction, and only take score when you have a very strong reason to believe you’re being taken advantage of. \r\n[2] To be explicit: I want an intimate and securely attached relationship, and I’m excited to support my pattern when they need it. But I am attracted to people who can be whole and happy in the absence of a romantic partner."

      "fullText": "﻿Manuel 08-2025\r\n________________\r\nBio\r\nI love deep conversations and unwinding with a book or a cup of coffee. I’m drawn to people who are smart, ambitious, and kind — not just in words, but in action. Honesty and straightforwardness mean everything to me, and I try to live by the same values. \r\nI’m monogamous and looking for a relationship that can grow into marriage. I’m attracted to women, but I don’t get caught up in narrow boxes of gender expression. My long-term goals are to earn a PhD, keep building my career in research and security policy, and create a home where love and laughter matter just as much as achievement. I’m open to children, whether by birth or adoption, and I can imagine either a rooted, settled life or a more nomadic, international one. What matters most is partnership: choosing and building together. \r\nFamily matters to me. My mother is a central part of my life, and I believe in gratefulness—if your parents are good people, it’s important to nurture that relationship. \r\nMy roots stretch across the Americas. My grandfather moved around the continent with the American Telegraph Company, my mom volunteered in Nicaragua during the time of the Contras, and I first went to Guatemala when I was 13 — the civil war stories I heard there shaped why I went into security studies. I’m Mexican by birth, with Middle Eastern family history, so contradictions and cultural layers have always been part of my life.\r\nGrowing up, I spent 12 years in the Scouts and trained in martial arts. It gave me a love for teamwork, resilience, and the outdoors. Those lessons shaped me just as much as my professional path. I grew up in Waldorf and used to romanticize that world, though over time my tastes have shifted. I published my first poem in an anthology when I was 16.         I love the history of ideas, aesthetics and political economy. \r\nEA-wise, between 2021 and 2023, I worked informally with the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative (SERI). That experience culminated in a small post “Foundations for a Longtermist Foreign Policy.” In it, I argued for deeper collaboration between the effective altruism and defense communities, challenging narrow AI risk framings and emphasizing actionable, implementable solutions. Since then, I’ve focused on the intersection of military capabilities, doctrine, and venture capital — not from a technical angle, but through strategic analysis.\r\nI love good food (fresh from the market). At my core, I’m principled but pragmatic, mixing seriousness with humor and idealism with realism.  I want a genuine connection with someone curious, ambitious, and kind — someone who can challenge me with ideas, and also remind me to laugh and enjoy the lighter side of life.\r\nig:mthe_turbantghost\r\nBasic Info\r\n* Name: Manuel\r\n\r\n* Age: 24\r\n* MBTI: ENTP\r\n* Height: 178 cm\r\n\r\n* Languages: Spanish, English\r\n\r\n* Location: Small town in the middle of nowhere, Mexico\r\n\r\n* From: San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. \r\n\r\n* Lives in: Palo Alto, CA (If the DHS would let me in.

      "fullText": "﻿👋Hey, I’m Adam, if you’re here, you’ve reached my “date me doc”. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a partner, female, preferably in/from the Czech Republic, ~20-30 y/o. \r\nMy policy is: If you have a friend who you think might be interested, feel free to send this to them, but please do not post or discuss it publicly. (contacts at the end)\r\nAbout me  \r\nI’m 25 y/o and currently live in Prague. I’m working as a software engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously I studied in the US at Caltech (BSc) and in Switzerland at ETH Zurich (MSc, on hold), both Computer Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are my Big Five results.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy hiking/camping and basically any sport (currently mostly just lifting / running / swimming / bouldering / … before I did ultimate frisbee and karate).\r\n\r\n\r\nI have many hobbies: 3D printing, electronics, computers and software (of course), analog/digital photography, audio equipment, … \r\nMy most impressive project is probably WALL-E.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like video games, listening to music and cooking. I’m trying to pick up reading and watching movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes I wear a beard, sometimes I don’t, and sometimes I don’t care how I look\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I want from a relationship (very compressed)\r\nI’d like to find someone I’ll love, and someone who’ll love me back. I want to be vulnerable but also strong and supportive. I want to grow and experience things together. \r\n\r\n\r\nPractically, I’m looking to date seriously — i.e. work towards marriage and kids (at least 2 kids is important to me). I’d most likely want to settle down in Prague.\r\nMore about me\r\nI’m generally very open, honest and direct. It’s sometimes a good trait, sometimes a bad trait. \r\nI’m also quite emotional, and do a lot of introspection. \r\nHelping others, either through my actions or just emotional support, fulfills me. I care deeply about my friends.\r\nI’m quite extroverted and get along with people easily. Sometimes I like to go partying, and I’ve had a small number of positive experiences with psychedelics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subcultures that have influenced me the most are Effective Altruism and Rationality. I have been involved in some community organizing in both of them. Having a positive influence on the world* and being able to reason about my own mind is central to me.\r\n*Specifically, I’m most concerned about risks from AI systems,  and secondly about current (geo)politics and demographics.\r\n\r\n\r\n^That being said, I also got pretty badly burnt out from chasing my goals and EA too hard. So for the past few years, I’ve been also (re)learning how to just enjoy myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily is also important to me. Even though my childhood wasn’t the best, I’m greatly moved when thinking about things like: creating a home, being a good father, supporting my wife (and receiving support). But family is also one of the biggest challenges in my life — I often feel anxious at the thought of failure. \r\n\r\n\r\nWho is a good partner to me\r\nI’m not sure, I’ve only had two <1 year relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy main hypotheses are (do not read into this too much!):\r\n* At least somewhat extroverted — I’m gonna drag you out to people\r\n* At least somewhat fit — I’m gonna drag you out to sports\r\n* At least somewhat outdoorsy — We’re gonna go camping\r\n* Care/know about something\r\n* Want to improve in something\r\n* Able to communicate clearly and think about your own feelings…\r\n   * I think understanding oneself is hard, and understanding relationships even harder\r\n   * I want to work together towards figuring out how we feel, if and where lies conflict within or between us, and what are the most beneficial compromises we can find\r\n   * I want to not be afraid to bring up difficult topics\r\n\r\n\r\nA red flag for me is making fun of being interested in something (e.g. nerdy stuff).\r\n\r\n\r\nI also somewhat care about looks. I wish my male brain wasn’t wired up this way, but there’s just some way a certain type of cuteness makes me melt. I don’t even know how to describe my “type” though: brown/blonde hair, cute smile/giggle, touchy/feely? Oh and I like sex…\r\n________________\r\nAppendices\r\nMusic I like\r\n* Psychedelic rock: King Gizzard & Lizard Wizard, Pink Floyd, Kikagaku Moyo, MGMT, …\r\n* Synth pop: Magdalena Bay, Charli XCX, ..\r\n* Soul: Lianne le Havas, Cleo Sol, …\r\n* Ambient: Aphex Twin, Burial, Carbon Based Lifeforms, …\r\n* Modern jazz: GoGo Penguin, Mammal Hands, Yussef Dayes, …\r\n* Hyper pop: Vylet Pony, The Hellp, Jane Remover, underscores, …\r\n* Hip-hop: A Tribe Called Quest, MF DOOM, Tyler the Creator\r\n* Math rock: toe, plini, covet, American Football\r\nPeople I follow\r\n* Jan Kulveit\r\n* Oliver Habryka\r\n* Samo Burja\r\nPlaces I’ve been to\r\n* Nepal (Everest Base Camp)\r\n* Costa Rica / Panama (digital nomad trip during covid)\r\n* Approximately everywhere within ~2 day driving distance from Los Angeles\r\n* Mexico\r\n* Almost everywhere in Europe except the nordics (really want to!) and Spain/Portugal\r\n\r\n\r\n…I’m currently kind of exhausted from travelling, but some day I’d also really like to go to China or Japan. I think travelling is a great way to get to know each other!\r\nContacts\r\n* Email: krivka.adam@gmail.com\r\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aidam.krivka \r\n* Discord: @adamkrivka\r\n* Signal/WA/cell: +420 606 905 850"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\nYou’re almost there — sign up to start building in Notion today.\nSign up or login\n☺️\nHey there! I’m Roxanne 👋\nShare\n☺️\nHey there! I’m Roxanne 👋\nImagine me in a bookstore or coffee shop, chatting with friends or next to a stack of books I want to read. That's me! You'll also see me line dancing, making this face (🥹♥️) at animals, spending time with my nieces, or planting seeds on my balcony to see what will grow.\n🔍 About me\nName: Roxanne\nAge: 36\nLocation: Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada\nOccupation: Customer Support and Administration for Pro Church Tools\nWorldview/Beliefs: I’m a Christian and firmly have following the ways of Jesus Christ and attending church as foundations in my life.\nPersonality type: ENFJ/ENFP - depending on the day I take the online quiz 😅\n🔥 My passions\nMy Faith: I’m a passionate follower of Jesus Christ, and love talking about it! So much so that when I graduated high school I went to college for Christian Theology and graduated with a B.Th (graduated with honours).\nFamily: I’m a small town girl with a big family. I have four sisters, and a brother, and now have several nieces, with (I’m sure) more coming in the future. I’m close with my family and prioritize staying in touch and showing up for holidays and special events, as well as taking care of each other when we need it. It’s important to me that whoever I date recognizes and supports this priority, and I look forward to getting to know and love your family as well.\nLearning: I love learning new things - whether that’s through listening to podcasts, taking classes, or trying out new hobbies. (Some recent ones have been vocal lessons, figure skating, line dancing, and an acrylic painting class) 🤓\nReading: Give me a good story, a cozy corner, and a cup of coffee and I’m happy girl! Even better if it includes a rainy fall day, an oversized sweater, and a candle. 📚\nDancing: Catch me line dancing pretty much every week, and keeping wedding dance parties going long into the night. 💃🏻\nHaving A Good Sense of Humour (and being kind and generous) In All Circumstances : I get it - sometimes life sucks, things don’t go your way, and people can be the worst. But staying positive, kind, and having the ability to find the humour and laugh even in the midst of disappointment or frustration is important to me. If you’re able to balance taking serious things seriously with making jokes at the craziness of life, and facing each person you meet with generosity and kindness even when they’re frustrating you - then we’ll be a great fit. 😊\nNeed a wedding dance party date? I’m your girl!\n🕵️ What I am looking for\nSo far, Hermione is my ideal partner! (Look how cute she is 🥹😍)\nRelationship Goals: A husband 😋 I’m looking for someone who is looking for something serious. Someone who is wanting to build a relationship that will weather the highs and lows of life.\nIdeal Partner:\nSomeone who gives major golden retriever energy, who loves life, is outgoing (or at least doesn’t need to be babysat at social events) makes the best of every circumstance, and does so with thoughtfulness towards those around him.\nSomeone who loves God deeply and wants to reflect that love to the world around them.\nSomeone free spirited and adventurous with enough grounding to commit to a long term relationship with a toe-dipping girl like me. ♥️\n(Big bonus points if you smell nice and give life altering hugs)\nValues: Kindness, respectfulness, positivity, good sense of humour, ability to have fun, decorum, generosity, and passion for both loving God and loving the people around them. 🤗\n👀 Fun facts about me!\nFood: I, along with all of my biological siblings, have an autoimmune condition called Celiac Disease (a severe reaction to eating gluten). This means my life is strictly gluten free. Thankfully this can still be delicious, and I love trying out new gluten free recipes, and dream of mastering a gluten free loaf of bread. 🍞\nMusic: My music taste is wide ranging from musical scores (don’t even get me started on Titans Spirit from Remember the Titans!), pop country, jazz, alt rock, and 80s pop/retro pop. 🎶\nPets: two cats, Artemis and Hermione. I love them with my whole heart 😻\nHobbies: Reading, ice skating, line dancing, painting/sketching, neighbourhood strolls, and admiring a good sunset. (Oh, and going on passionate rants about how important in person relationships are, and how much being online has disrupted the goodness of life 😅)\n📱 Let’s connect\nInstagram: RoxyWiedemann\nTikTok: RoxyWiedemann\n💌 Rlwiedemann@live.ca"

      "fullText": "﻿Dina’s Date Me Doc\r\n        \r\n\r\nBasics\r\nI’m female, heterosexual, 37, want kids, open to monogamous or some polyamorous arrangements, based in NYC, hypothetically open to moving for the right person maaaybe\r\nWhy I’m making this doc\r\nI want to meet someone I can truly respect, admire, and love. Perhaps I’m pickier than I can afford. But meeting someone great and building a long-term partnership and a family is quite important to me. I don’t want to just date someone for the sake of dating someone – been there done that.\r\nI like experimenting with different modalities of meeting people. I hope this boosts the chances of success, but it also just makes the process more fun for me. For example, a friend of mine played matchmaker for me on Hinge for a while, which was great. I went on an acquaintance’s reality show date which went hilariously horribly (entirely my own fault). I go to a decent number of meetups to try to meet people organically and also just to do the things the meetup is for: climbing, talking about the latest Sam Harris episode, odd rationality meetups, etc. Now I can add this weird modality to the list.\r\nVibes I have and look for\r\n-            I try to break through the bullshit as much as possible. I’m annoyed by a lot of society’s ideas of what’s ‘normal’ and ‘respectable’ and genuinely enjoy people who eschew those norms even in little ways. For example, one of my exes wore the same shirt for at least a week at a time and I loved that. I often try to break out of small talk with personal questions or jokes or just by oversharing.\r\n-            I am playful and humorous and enjoy someone who is mostly serious and occasionally hilarious, especially in otherwise serious situations. There is nothing that’s too serious to joke about in my book, and the jokes don’t have to be clever they could just be absurd or cute.\r\n-            I like conversations about our personal experiences and emotions, more abstract social dynamics, philosophy, a bit of politics etc but only if we both approach it with an air of open-minded inquiry and not a dogmatic stance or getting overly enamored with our own ideas.\r\n-            I’m not a nerd but I speak nerd. I mean ‘nerd’ here in the best way possible—someone who gets very interested, even obsessed with things, and wants to learn every detail about it or get to the bottom of it. I spent a long time being annoyed with myself for not being a nerd in this sense. I’m mostly over that now and I accept my own preference for generality and moderation. But I do have a deep respect for nerds and enjoy talking to them, and like to think I’m intelligent enough to keep up and contribute.\r\n-            I definitely have a type, although I have trouble putting into words exactly what it is. It’s got something to do a with a combination of the above things, something about being thoughtful and open and genuine and not getting caught up in what I perceive to be bs. But don’t self-screen too much that’s my job 😊\r\nProfessional bio\r\n-            I spent most of my life in school. After finishing undergrad (in physics) I did a weird sleep-away-camp-style master’s program (also in physics) followed by a grueling 7.5-year phd (you guessed it, physics). Throughout all that time, I was never sold on physics as the right career path for me. Why did I stick with it? A combination of stubbornness, sunk cost fallacy, not having a good alternative and depression. But at this point, I do not regret it. It’s shaped my mind and given me a visceral appreciation for the predictive power of science.\r\n-            After my PhD, I didn’t know what I wanted to do, so I did a data science bootcamp. As one does. The bootcamp itself was great and I learned a lot, but the jobs I was applying for through the bootcamp were less than thrilling, lots of hedge funds and ad agencies. I don’t have particularly strong moral principles against this, but I just realized I wasn’t going to be able to get my ass out of bed every morning for those jobs.\r\n-            Instead, I got offered a short-term stint at the communications office at the university where I did my PhD, making a physics podcast and doing science writing for their website. I had no qualifications for this and got the job through nepotism. But it turned into a long-term part-time job, and I realized I’d been craving a creative component to my work, and writing/podcasting provided me with that. Also, I love podcasts. Check out Relatively Certain wherever you get yours.\r\n-            A couple years ago I did an internship at a popular science magazine (while keeping my job with my old university). Then I freelanced for a year, before getting a full time job at said magazine. My beat is computing, but I do get to write more physicsy stories sometime, and write a bit about AI. Overall I’m pretty proud of myself for switching careers without retraining. I have good days and bad days, like everyone, but I find my job generally meaningful and at times even fulfilling.\r\nHobbies and interests\r\n-            My consistency with meditation waxes and wanes, but it is a pretty important part of my worldview. I mostly do mindfulness-type meditation, I’ve done one ten-day silent retreat which was both horrible and enlightening. I love discussing experiences with mindfulness and philosophy although I’m not super knowledgeable about it.\r\n-            I love singing. I’ve taken lessons for years and sang in choirs and I’m still very bad. I’m not being humble, I promise. Nevertheless, I love it and sing a lot of the time just walking around and doing tasks. I also love musicals, and sometimes watch reality tv singing shows, or go through all the live versions of one song on youtube to find my favorite one. I love sharing music with people and talking about what it means to us, though again, I’m not a nerd so not great at music trivia and have very limited knowledge.\r\n-            I used to run a lot, but now my knee is bad so I can’t run much. I do need cardio to stay sane though, so I either jog a bit or get on an elliptical several times a week. I like Zumba sometimes too. I also love yoga and used to teach it, though I’ve laid off it a bit in the past year. A couple of years ago I took up climbing and it’s been great fun. I think climbing is a great date activity!\r\n-            I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks. Some of my all-time favs are Heavyweight, Mystery Show, and Alone: A love story. I also listen to more interview-style shows like Making Sense and 80,000 hours and Clearer Thinking. Always on the lookout for great podcast recs!\r\n-            I’ve gotten pretty interested in effective altruism of late. I don’t consider myself naturally altruistic, but I’m trying to do better. I want to try to figure out a way to do something good at least through donating and hopefully, my job, although I don’t want to completely switch jobs. I really respect people who are actually fundamentally altruistic, although this is definitely not a requirement.\r\n \r\nPros to dating me\r\n-            If we get to the serious relationship point, I feel I can be a very good partner. I find that my affection, once won, stays roughly constant, and I don’t keep looking around for something better. I naturally stay focused on the health of the relationship, am tactfully vocal about problems that I have, receptive to hearing my partner’s problems, and flexible and creative with resolving issues. This sounds a bit cocky, but I really believe that my love is good.\r\n-            I have the best cat in the world. You’d get her for free as part of the package\r\n-            I froze my eggs in my early 30’s so I don’t feel too much of a time crunch with the kid thing\r\n-            I am very easy going when it comes to most things (see the con side of that below), never naggy or manipulative, and generally a good time.\r\nCons to dating me\r\n-            I’ve struggled with depression on and off for most of my life. I put a lot of work into managing this, including therapy and meds (which luckily have spared my sex drive 😉) and it is mostly under control, but it occasionally still hits me when I least expect it. In times like these, I can be a downer to be around, although I pride myself on not taking my sadness out on other people. I also desire support from a partner in those times, which I think is particularly problematic because the types of people I tend to go for lead full lives and have strong interests that they may not want to be taken away from. Ideally, I would find someone for whom occasionally talking to a very sad person and giving them some hugs and encouragement would not feel like a burden, although I know it can be.\r\n-            I have quite poor attention to detail (prospective employers, get out of my date me doc!). This makes me easy-going in some ways, like I am just as happy with bodega coffee as I am with a fancy pour-over, I won’t care where I sit in a movie theater, and generally, if you have strong preferences about where to eat or what to watch you’d win almost every time. But it also makes me a bit absent-minded and occasionally gross, like I don’t care how my apartment is decorated, whether my shoes have holes in them, or whether my food spent some time in the trash.\r\n-            I can be a little sensitive to criticism if I don’t feel like it comes from a good place.\r\n-            There’s probably more but I can’t see it\r\n \r\nWhy are you single? (and past relationships)\r\nI was in one long-term serious relationship in my life that lasted 5+1 years (with a three-month breakup before the last year). This ended for complicated reasons and it took me quite a while to get over. I spent a long time not thinking I could love another person. Then, I spent a long time not feeling like I have the energy to look for the man of my dreams and instead contented myself with casual relationships, most of which were very nice. For the past couple of years, I’ve been looking more seriously, with a few false starts. It’s just hard to find someone I like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a date, or would simply like to be friends, give me a holler! My email is dinkazavr@gmail.com."

I find that’s the best way to understand the appeal of something that otherwise wouldn’t interest me.\r\n* I love a good adventure, but I can comfortably spend all day indoors reading, watching movies, or playing games.\r\n* I’m not the best at small talk, but I love actual conversation, so definitely don’t be scared to jump into a substantial subject right off the bat. I don’t get intimidated easily.\r\n* My great passions include writing (and the concept of story in general) and history (especially military history), but I have dozens of lesser interests also. I find too many subjects interesting, honestly.\r\n* I compulsively want to know everything I can, and try to find the answer to pretty much every question I encounter. You can find me on my phone looking up whatever question I just thought out loud. “Who would want to know that?” is the most baffling question of all to me.\r\n* I’m hard to offend and don’t mind talking/learning about weird things.\r\n* I can be very silly and tend to find comedy in everything. It’s rare that I pass up a chance to add levity to a situation. Life is much easier if you can find a way to laugh at it.\r\n* I don’t drink, smoke, or use any recreational drugs. I mostly don’t care if you do, as long as you’re not harming yourself in the process (which does pretty much preclude cigarettes).\r\n* I don’t have any kids, and I’m undecided if I actually want any, but I’m at least open to the idea."

A life partner, eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friends say I’m: enthusiastic, funny, perceptive, and affectionate.\r\n\r\n\r\nValues I’d like us to share: optimism, playfulness, creativity, intellectual curiosity, openness, altruism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork: I'm chief of staff to GiveWell's research director—we help people in need as much as we can. Previously I was a high school math teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nFun:\r\n* Climbing/staying fit: I climb ~every day and I’m always looking for more partners. I also bike to work nearly every day, run, lift, and generally stay very active. Lmk if you want to join the regular weekend hike that I organize!\r\n* Chatting with friends: I like to have long walks and dinners with close friends, to talk about our lives, our thoughts, our feelings, and everything under the sun.\r\n* Writing: I have umpteen blog drafts with titles like “How to listen better” and “How much do we really know about apples?” Occasionally I post them on my Substack, but tbh I get more joy from arguing about drafts with my friends than from posting final versions.\r\n* Music: I play piano and sing. Playing music for/with people is one of my favorite things in life — I go to jams as much as possible, and I stop by a public piano on my way home from work many evenings. I’m big into neo-soul and R&B right now; listening to Son Little on loop.\r\n* Reading: My in-progress reads are A Desolation Called Peace, John Stuart Mill's autobiography, Anton Chekhov’s short stories, and this essay. Several all-time favorites are Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, Tolstoy’s The Kingdom of God is Within You, and the epic Terra Ignota series.\r\n* Making stuff and trying new things: This year I've experimented with making kombucha and ice cream, plus vibe-coding several small apps.\r\n* Games: Some of my recent faves are spikeball, capture the flag, Lost Cities, Res Arcana, and Coup.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential dealbreakers:\r\n* I’ll probably be in the SF Bay until early 2027, then in DC. I'm happy to try out long distance for a 🔥 connection, and it’s easy for me to travel because I can work remotely.\r\n* I don't have strong feelings on many things that might be dealbreakers to others. If you’re concerned about dealbreakers I haven’t mentioned, err on the side of reaching out!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we have potential, Gmail me at calumbest1 — just say “saw your date-me doc” and tell me your name; I can handle the rest. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know me in real life, I won’t think it's awkward if you reach out, seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d also be interested in feedback on this doc 👀 is it good or does it suck?"

This isn't your typical dating profile - I wanted to share a bit about me without being limited by a dating app. If you know someone who might be interested, feel free to send this to them!\nAlex\nSep 14, 2023\nShare\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk (on Effective Altruism)\nBasic info\nMy name is Alex, but I've been called other things like “space wizard” (by a friend), \"clever iconoclast\" (by an ex-girlfriend), and “a very pleasant gentleman” (by my Orthopedic surgeon in his discharge notes). I'm a 31-year-old cis guy living in the Midtown district of Kansas City, working as an IT Analyst for an international law firm. I'm a philosophy and ethics nerd, but I also love insane adventures and chill evenings in. I’m highly versatile!\nI am on a journey to find someone who makes me feel emotionally safe, intellectually stimulated, and spiritually inspired. I hope to be that for them as well.\nEvery Space Wizard needs a Plasma Globe\nDetails\nI care deeply about humanity in general, and I also think every person is valuable and beautiful simply by virtue of being human.\nAbsurdism\nand\nRationality\nare core values of mine, and I geek out on all sorts of intellectual conversations. However, just talking isn’t enough for me. That's why I organize a local\nEffective Altruism\ngroup, where we explore how we can do the most good for the world, and I donate 10% of my income to effective charities. I founded a\nstartup\nfor community-based self-improvement, which is my passion project. I’m also vegan, for ethical, health, and environmental reasons.\nA picture of some of the folks in my Effective Altruism group. It has grown much since this picture was taken!\nI am not really into clubs or bars. I go maybe once a month or so for the dancing, or to the local arcade bar for the games, but loud environments that I have to shout over are not my usual choice.\nMe with a mocktail 😎\nMy idea of fun includes things like Dungeons and Dragons, cooking with friends, urban exploration, watching good\nmovies/shows\n, hiking in nature, and foraging for mushrooms (even though I despise the way they taste 😅). I’m also constantly reading, check out my reading list\nhere\n!\nBonus points if you get this movie reference 🥯\nTrespassing never looked so good. 😎\nWeird flex but okay\nI love cats; I have a cat named Loki. She is very well-behaved and affectionate. I like dogs too, though! I just don’t currently have the space for one in my apartment.\nLoki the cat (not beating the stereotypes today)\nI also attend Burning Man every year, with a nerdy camp of tabletop roleplaying gamers. You are welcome to join me! Or not, whatever floats your boat. :)\nCall me ‘Gandalf the Slay’ Servant of the Secret 🔥Fire🔥\nIf you are lucky, maybe this NPC will grant you a Quest.\nI love traveling, and would consider moving somewhere else mid-term, but I have a preference for staying anchored to Kansas City in the short-term. I’m trying to foster the local Effective Altruism/Rationality scenes, which is a mission that means a lot to me.\nA picture of me visiting the Bay area of SF!\nAs far as spirituality is concerned, I’m a strict materialist at my core (I think Madonna had it right). However, I believe recapturing some sense of the sacred is important for a meaningful life, and I love chatting about religion and meaning-making. A friend once called me “the most spiritual non-spiritual person I know”. I think the universe (especially consciousness) is a lot\nweirder\nthan most materialists give it credit for. I’ve even been known to dabble in Tarot and such for the fun of it. However, the key is that I believe we are physical beings in a physical universe, and I do not think that there exist any minds apart from bodies such as gods, spirits, or anything like that.\nBecause I do not believe in any afterlife, I believe that death is bad, and that one of the human race’s most important long-term goals should be shielding sentient minds from it. I also believe that extreme suffering is the foundation of ethics. Despite my mostly Consequentialist views on ethics, I believe that conscious creatures have an inherent dignity, and should not be subjugated or commercialized.\nPersonality breakdown\nThe Big Five (aka “OCEAN”)  model of personality is the best predictor of life outcomes, including romantic outcomes! According to\nthis study\n, low Neuroticism, plus high Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness are great predictors of romantic satisfaction. I’m proud to say I score well on that front! You can see my full breakdown\nhere\n.\nMy biggest weaknesses is that, within Neuroticism, despite scoring low on aggregate, I score high on Immoderation. It can be tough for me to pace myself on ice cream sometimes. 😉\nBut this is easily remedied with systems, such as making sure I don’t stock unhealthy foods in the house, and putting limits on my phone usage.\nWhat I’m Looking For\nMy goal is to live with a life partner/spouse. Ideally, I would have this accomplished within the next 3-5 years.\nDealbreakers:\nanyone who is doctrinally religious (subscribes to some kind of religion where you literally and unambiguously believe in things like ghosts, souls, etc). Similarly, anyone who literally believes in woo such as astrology, chakras, or manifestation (unless you have a randomized control trial to back it up!)\nanyone who\nidentifies strongly\nwith many of their beliefs (note: this is\nnot\nthe same as having strongly-held opinions!). You have to know what would change your mind on any belief of great importance, including ethical beliefs.\nanyone who will stock animal products in the house (vegan partners preferred, but I’m somewhat flexible on this and I am happy to cook!)\nI am a very extroverted person; I would like someone who is similarly excited to spend time with people and organize interesting events.\nHonesty is key for me, and I also make it a point to avoid lies of omission. I want to be with someone who similarly values honesty.\nStaying in shape and taking care of myself physically is important to me, and I want someone who also takes care of themselves. I have a workout routine, a facial care routine, I shower daily, and go above and beyond with dental hygiene. I keep my BMI in a healthy and attractive range. Let’s be a hot power couple together. 😉\nI am ambivalent on the subject of children. I can see myself really enjoying being a parent, if my partner is enthusiastically on board. If you have a strong preference either way, I am happy to defer to you. However, I do have a moderate preference for adoption if I do have kids. Willing to discuss.\n(Note: I have had a Vasectomy; and while they have a 60%-90% chance of reversal, any biological children\nmight\nhave to be conceived via IVF or some other artificial means).\nI think I'm a pretty cool person, and I put in a lot of effort to be the kind of partner I'd want to be with. If you're interested in getting coffee or a drink sometime, let me know! Virtual dates are also an option if you don’t live in my area.\nAlso, don’t worry about what I will think if you reach out! If I say no, I will not be mean about it, think less of you, or let it affect any other aspect of our relationship.\nYou can text me at 816-541-6685, stalk me on\nFacebook\nor\nInstagram\n, or email me at\nalex.hedtke@gmail.com\nShare\nDiscussion about this post\nComments\nRestacks\nTop\nLatest\nDiscussions\nNo posts\nReady for more?\nSubscribe\n© 2025 Alex Hedtke\nPrivacy\n∙\nTerms\n∙\nCollection notice\nStart your Substack\nGet the app\nSubstack\nis the home for great culture"

      "fullText": "Erik's Date Me Doc | Erik Lönnroth's blog\nErik Lönnroth's blog\nAbout\nBlog\nProjects\n# Hello!\nMy name is Erik Lönnroth, and I am looking to meet the love of my life. I’ve written this doc to help you decide whether I'm someone worth getting to know. I’ve tried to be as honest about my shortcomings as I am about my strengths.\n💁‍♂️ About me\nI’m 39 years old, 175cm (5'9) and fortunate to be in excellent health. I’m from Sweden but live in Cape Town and currently work remotely for a strategy consulting firm based in London. I triangulate between these three locations in order to maintain my career, friendships, and family ties. I’m fluent in Swedish, English and French, and can get by in a handful of other human and computer languages.\nAs much as I love Cape Town for its stunning nature and colourful characters, I would consider relocating for the right person.\nI don’t have any kids, but hope to one day get married and start a family. If you have kids, that’s perfectly fine, as long as you’re open to having a few more.\n🔎 How I view things\nIf I have a superpower, it’s my ability to observe a situation from multiple perspectives. I look for the grain of truth in each point of view, rather than rejecting any as wholly wrong or bad. I then seek to find a way forward by integrating the nuggets of wisdom from each perspective into a coherent whole. Sometimes this process can make me slow at decision making. But once I’ve decided, I don’t tend to look back. To balance out my analytical tendencies, I appreciate having a partner with a well honed intuition. Someone who can say “this feels right” and trust her gut. Importantly though, she needs to be good at reasoning from first principles so we can resolve disagreements respectfully.\n🛶 Marriage is a vessel\nAlthough I wouldn’t describe myself as conventionally religious, spirituality is the foundation of my life. I maintain a daily meditation practice that has taken years to cultivate, but I’ve finally found the key to consistency. Once or twice a year I attend Zen retreats in Europe or the US. These periods of intense practice have frequently sparked profound awakenings for me, leading to greater clarity, connectedness, and wisdom.\nI would like my partner to walk the spiritual path with me, not as my student or teacher, but as my equal. Your practice doesn’t necessarily have to be sitting meditation; it could be yoga, breathwork, prayer, embodiment practices, or anything else that opens your heart and mind. What matters is that you approach it with utmost dedication and deep curiosity. Ultimately, I view marriage as a vessel for two individuals to experience the Divine through Love, and I want my wife to share this vision for our relationship. That doesn’t mean that everything we talk about has to be imbued with the language of sacredness — 99% of the time it won’t — only that we have a shared understanding of our deepest purpose on this planet: to help each other awaken. Whether you believe in God or not matters less to me than your capacity to take on each day recognising the precious gift that it is to simply be alive! My greatest fear is finding myself on my deathbed facing the bitter realisation that I held back out of fear, never daring to love fully.\n🤓 Live to learn\nI’ve dedicated my career to building innovative approaches to learning, mostly in Africa, where educational institutions are currently failing half a billion children. Over the years I’ve launched literacy interventions in Kenya, developed tablet-based teaching solutions in Zambia, and run an online mathematics tutoring startup in South Africa. At times a Quixotic mission, it has nevertheless been immensely fascinating and fulfilling.\nI have an insatiable curiosity about people and things. I subscribe to a wide array of newspapers, blogs, and podcasts on everything from finance and technology to psychology and history. Admittedly, this sometimes feels like drinking out of a firehose, and I’m increasingly wondering whether I might in fact be better off on a minimal information diet. If we end up dating, one of the ways you can help me stay present is to keep reminding me to put my phone/laptop away. Preferably in another room.\n🌍 Pole to pole\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence that as someone who constantly seeks to integrate different perspectives, I divide my time between northern Europe and southern Africa. Africa is vivid, colourful, crazy, and often dysfunctional — it unlocks my adventurous spirit while allowing me to appreciate the things we take for granted in the developed world. Europe, on the other hand, offers me career opportunities, family ties, and cultural belonging. As much as I would love to continue having one foot in each continent, I’m also prepared to give that up and commit to one location for the sake of marriage, if my partner is unable to follow my migratory patterns.\n🐺 Into the wild\nI love being active and staying in shape. I’m training for an ultra trail race later this year, which requires a lot of running and functional fitness. I’m generally a fan of anything to do with mountains and the sea, such as hiking, climbing, skiing, sailing, and surfing.\nAt least once a year I like to go on a proper adventure, camping out in some remote wilderness far from civilisation, swallowed up by the silence of mountains and the twinkling of stars. Though I occasionally crave the restorative benefits of escaping off-grid all on my own, most of the time I want to bring my woman along to experience the majesty. Hopefully you’re the kind of lady who loves the outdoors and doesn’t mind a little dirt under her finger nails.\n🫃Let’s make a food baby!\nWhen it comes to sustenance, I’m a discerning omnivore. I enjoy cooking and I love trying out new restaurants. On a Sunday morning, I’ll walk the extra mile for specialist coffee or an artisanal bakery. However, as much as I love the finer things in life, I’m also happy to have a relaxing evening and order takeaway (but please read the most recent reviews, just to be sure!).\nI drink alcohol in moderation, and often go dry for weeks at a time. I don’t smoke or take drugs. I’d like to keep my mental and physical faculties sharp for many decades to come, and if we’re to grow old together, it’s important to me that you also look after your body and mind.\n🪘Music fuels the soul\nMy friends and I often get together and host impromptu musical jam sessions. We play, sing, dance, chat, and party like this most weekends. It’s a blast and one of the most amazing ways of kicking off steam. Sometimes our jams attract more than 30 people — all levels welcome! The friendships forged over the years at these gatherings have led me to various spinoff hobbies and pursuits, including freediving, motorcycle trips, and launching a business.\n☯️ The best and worst of me\nIntegrity, intellect, calm, discipline, kindness, generosity, adventure. These are the qualities I have to offer. But you’re likely to also encounter judgment, doubt, and withdrawal. That is how I'll react when you let me down. I experience disappointment viscerally, and my instinct is to pull away, creating distance. Softening into faith and forgiveness instead of descending into doubt — that’s The Work for me. But the silver lining is this: as much as I can dish out the tough love, I’m also good at receiving it without defensiveness or deflection. You can be radically honest with me, and I will listen attentively, seek to understand your perspective, and appreciate you for having the courage to speak your mind.\n🧲 What attracts me\nI'm turned on by women who are fully, unapologetically themselves. Those who have the courage to drop carefully maintained facades in favour of a disarming realness. Those who, while working to be more loving and compassionate, also honour and acknowledge their Shadow. I want to know both the saint and the sinner within. A woman who shows up fully is willing to challenge taboos, confess her deepest desires to her partner, and expand emotional and intimate boundaries. By maintaining a non-judgmental space where no topic or question is off limits we allow our lover to open the kimono all the way - physically, psychologically and spiritually.\nA marriage will lose its spark unless we find ways of continuously surprising each other and ourselves. The juicy bits are hiding in the shadows, and it is our sacred practice to bring those aspects into the light and own them.\n💚 Green flags\nI don’t expect you to tick all of these, but they’ll give you an idea of the qualities that would make\nme\njump in with both feet.\nSpeaks from the heart\nKeeps promises, big and small\nNot too concerned with what others think\nCultured and deeply curious about the world\nEloquent writer and/or speaker — it correlates with being a good thinker\nHas the courage and determination to do hard things, like completing a PhD, growing a business, publishing a novel, or being a competitive athlete\nAcknowledges her trauma without making it into an identity\nMaintains fun-loving, kind, ambitious friends\nHas her financial life in order, though I recognise that sometimes life deals us lemons\nDecent dancer (I love to shake ma booty!)\nOver to you\nIf you found your way to this page through some algorithm and don’t have my contact details, you can send me an\nemail\n.

Looking to settle down in the next few years, maybe buy a house.  \r\n* Kids: I’m Interested in having kids in the next few years but don’t feel ready yet. I recently banked sperm. \r\n* Personality: INTJ/INTP, Extraversion: very low, Agreeableness: low, Conscientiousness: moderate/high, Neuroticism: high, Openness to Experience: low (but seems to fluctuate?)\r\n* Mono/poly: I'm monogamous myself, but I could be ok with my partner being poly and have dated poly people in the past. \r\n* Neurotype: I’m somewhere on the autism spectrum (I’ve been informally diagnosed and score a 31 on the AQ test, right at the cutoff point, which feels about right – I’m not super autistic, but also not completely neurotypical. I feel like this mainly manifests as noise sensitivity and slight auditory processing issues but also I’ve been told I’m a bit socially awkward). \r\n* Location: I live near Boston, in the suburbs. \r\n* Pets: I love cats and have a cat named Ditto. \r\n* Travel: I am not a huge world traveler but I have been to 21 states and 3 countries (Canada, UK, Switzerland), and I want to travel to different parts of Europe in the next few years. \r\n* Religion: I'm a weak atheist but am not anti-religion. I occasionally attend either Buddist or Unitarian Universalist gatherings. I’m OK with my partner being part of a religious tradition and attending church, but if you believe your religion is the one true system then we are not a good fit. \r\n* Education: I have a Ph.D. in physics at Stony Brook University on Long Island, which I finished in 2016. \r\n* Activities: board games, reading (especially sci-fi), writing on my blog, contra dance, running outside, going to the gym, attending science fiction / fantasy conventions. I want to get back into piano and indoor rock climbing. I’ve done swing dance, ballroom, waltz, and square dance a bit, and enjoyed them, but my favorite is contra. Many years ago I was really into amateur astronomy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpsides\r\n* Careful thinker: My last partner said I’m a very careful thinker, and that seems right!\r\n* I value communication a lot. I don’t let potential issues fester. I will ask a lot of questions to find out what my partner likes. \r\n* I’m patient and kind. These are two virtues I’ve cultivated over many years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownsides \r\n* Sensitive sleeper - and I’ve been dealing with restless legs issues and poor sleep quality off and on the last few years but am making some progress on it.  \r\n* Noise sensitivity – you’re looking for someone to go to loud bars or crowded concerts often, I’m probably not your person. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore stuff\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy intellectual discussions and I am trying to become more well-rounded. For many years I was very narrowly focused on academic research. Now I'm expanding my intellectual horizons and learning about history and philosophy. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a pretty complex person. I like to think that gives me an extra level of maturity and makes me interesting to date and get to know!\r\n\r\n\r\nI purposefully didn’t go into where I was born or my childhood so there’s one easy thing to chat about if we go on a first date. \r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures"

      "fullText": "Date Me | Yash Mittal\nDate Me | Yash Mittal\nYash Mittal\nBlog\nLife\nDate Me\nFriday, September 19, 2025\nHello 👋 I’m Yash. I live in San Francisco, California. Although this page may suggest otherwise, I’m not super tech bro-y. I spend a good amount of time in front of screens, yet I’m quite technologically challenged. This is a running doc on my personality as well as what I’m looking for in a partner.\nPreface:\nI don’t have a laundry list of filters. I’m not perfect, and I don’t expect my partner to be either. Importantly, I don’t look for finished products.\nA little about me\nIndia, 1998. Born to Hindi, forced to English. To echo words of\nNaval Ravikant\n, I have a calm mind, am working toward a fit body, and am looking for a house full of love. Strictly monogamous. Have an older sister. Parents back in India.\nI’ve moved a lot since covid, almost too much to the point that it’s exhausting to even think about packing suitcases. Grateful for all experiences. I’ve spent my formative years outside India and have been away from home for 12 years. I’m currently a software engineer.\nI’m not a transactional person. It irks me when people give depending on what they’ve received in the past, in any relationship, not just romantic ones. I keep my friend circle small, and I’m happy to do things by myself - I don’t want superficial connections. I am routinely alone, and I’m generally secure about this, although I have some off days too.\nI don’t like labels because I believe everyone’s on some sort of spectrum. I don’t know my MBTI, but I am more on the introverted side. It takes me a bit to open up and be vulnerable. I am obviously batshit crazy and act possessed around people I trust.\nI grew up as a vegetarian. In meats, I only eat chicken (and sometimes salmon). I don’t care if you eat/cook whatever, but of course it would be lovely to be able to share most of our meals. I also love cooking for others when I’m in the mood.\nHomebody at heart but try my best to not miss a sunny day. Like to try any and all sports.\nNorth star:\nI want to be proud of myself when I’m 80. Actively working on being more present. At any given moment, I’m usually chipping away at my doc on life goals. Mostly just vibing though.\nWhat I’m looking for\nSomeone who hyperfixates on the positives. Spending years together is not going to be easy if we can’t look past the trivial/unimportant. I default to seeing the good in people way before their flaws, and I’d like to be with someone who leans the same way.\nPatience. One of my favorite quotes from A Gentleman in Moscow:\nBy their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration – and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.\nIn for the long haul and I’m happy to take things slowly. That said, patience also doesn’t mean bottling up feelings until a vague notion of “enough time” has passed. If I like you, I’ll try my best to communicate it.\nNon-judgemental. My best friendships are with people who are kind in their hearts and deeply care about understanding each other.\nA partnership full of growth. Someone who supports the other person thru the ups and downs, someone soft and candid. We laugh easily and tease each other. Good chemistry and intimacy. No topic is off the table and no walking on egg shells.\nIf\nyou’re Indian, I’d love to be able to speak Hindi with you, although it’s not a must-have. I am also typically more attracted to Indians who grew up in India - easier to connect.\nA beautiful smile.\nWhat I don’t want 🚩\nIf you play games (think tiktoks on loyalty tests etc). No time for those. If I can avoid it, I don’t want anyone to have to second-guess what I’m thinking or wait ages for a response from me.\nIf you treat me like an option, I’m out. I naturally focus on one person at a time, even early on. It’s ok if you aren’t the same (you’re a queen - I’m sure you have options), but after a few dates, I expect honesty about whether you see something here. Please don’t keep me around as a backup - be kind.\nA political activist. I don’t want to talk politics day in day out. To me, politics is mentally and emotional draining with no clear benefit.\nDrugs or substance addiction. I drink occasionally and I don’t smoke. I strongly prefer non-smokers, but I’m ok as long as you don’t stink and are healthy.\n-\nIf you made it this far, thank you :) Again, anything mentioned above is a nice-to-have. I am hopelessly optimistic in people, for better or for worse. I know it can be scary to reach out, but I promise I’ll be nice to you. Please email me at\nyashmittal2009 [at] gmail [dot] com\n.\nWords of\nYash Mittal"

I'm gentle, often uncertain and indecisive and sometimes stumble over my words. I like being around people who are reasonably talkative and energetic, as I find myself being more talkative and energetic with them, which I like.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy worldview is firmly rationalist, scientific materialist. I don't think i could date someone who believes in the supernatural. I do however go to my local Buddhist temple and try to meditate regularly. The philosophy of love and kindness to all beings, and using awareness and mindfulness to reduce suffering resonantes with me. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also vegan, center- left politically,a loose member of the Effective Altruism movement and donate around 10% of my salary to effective charities working to bring people out of extreme poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to be able to talk about ‘deep’ stuff with a partner. That might be your worldviews, the things you value, memories, things you're proud of, secrets, embarrassing stories.  I'm not very dogmatic in my views and want to be able to disagree with a partner and still be able to respect each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of my hobbies at the moment revolve around bikes. My holidays often involve long cycling trips through europe. I'd love someone to join me on these adventures, and for camping, wild swimming and hiking. \r\n\r\n\r\nI sometimes take illegal drugs, generally lsd, mdma or magic mushrooms, so you'd have to be OK with this and ideally up for joining me on trips.\r\n\r\n\r\nI currently think there's a 60% probability I won't ever want kids, and 75% I won't want them in the next 10 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a solid long term monogamous or primary relationship with someone I'm crazy about, but I'm quite up for making friends and flings along the way. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentration face\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have to duck under things a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat time i ascended into heaven"

      "fullText": "Date quinn | Quinn Dougherty\nSkip to main content\nQuinn Dougherty\nCV\nDate me\nemail\nDemographic\n33 years old, male, polyamorous\nSeeking\nWoman: romance, spouse, housemate, cofounder for childrearing projects.\nAlso seeking\nWomen: romance\nBig five\nSelf administered, summer 2022\n.\nIn Berkeley CA\nUnclear where to raise kids, though, and willing to travel a bunch for the first few months of dating a serious primary/coparent candidate.\nTestimonial by my dear friend Gavriel\n​\nWhat I most admire about Quinn is how much he cares and how much he’s willing to put action into his caring. He genuinely wants to be there for other people. I’ve seen him show so much openness to emotional connection in times when even other resilient and emotionally mature people would have been inclined to take a step back from their existing relationships. I’ve never seen stonewalling or apathy from him. Quinn always cares, and is excited to show that he cares. If you have the same love languages as Quinn, he’ll be able to make you feel super special. Being there for other people and caring doesn’t just mean caring about his friends or partners—he also shows up for communities. At a party, he’s either the host or the guy you assume is the host because he introduces a new burst of energy to each room he’s in.\nQuinn also has a super strong sense of self; he won’t passively fall into trends. I’ve never heard him be insincere or mocking. When so much media and so many conversations contain at least a little bit, and sometimes a lot, of mockery, Quinn has a refreshingly firm focus on topics where he can be completely sincere. Basically, it feels like the idiom “big-hearted” was invented to describe Quinn.\nTraits to make me swoon\n​\nSincerity\n: Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness.\nAnalyticalness\n: My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that.\nConviction\n: Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical.

Looking to build meaningful connections for polyamorous dating and community. Magnetic, warm, curious, playful, witty, and grounded.\nUsually wearing a smile.\nAbout me\nBasics\nAge: 36\nGender: Male\nLocation: San Francisco, CA\nHeight: 5’9”\nRelationship style: Polyamory/ENM\nOrientation: Bisexual\nWants kids: 85% no, has had a vasectomy\nClick here to contact me\nSummary\nI’m extroverted, energetic, and deeply curious—drawn to new ideas, intense conversations, and novel experiences. I believe you can decide what you want in life and take steps to create it.\nFor example, I once quit my job as an engineer, dropped out of a PhD, and bought a one-way ticket to Southeast Asia to build a business. Since then, I’ve settled in San Francisco and split my time between work, hobbies, and growing in weirdly wonderful communities.\nPeople tell me I’m someone they can call in a crisis. I stay grounded when things get messy and genuinely like helping others. If you care about personality types: I’m an ESTP, Enneagram 7w8, and Neutral Good.\nThanks for taking a look at my Date Me Doc. If you read this and feel a spark of curiosity, let’s talk!\nRelationships\nI’ve been in the ENM and kink scene since 2016. I am polyamorous and prefer kitchen table poly, where everyone can hang out together as they feel comfortable. I am currently dating a few people very casually.\nI’m looking for both primary and non-primary connections, where we can both be vulnerable, explore together, and collaborate on creating something unique between us. I love that every relationship brings something special to the table, and I don’t expect one person to meet every need.\nI have hesitations about dating someone who is brand new to polyamory and prefer that you have your own experiences to bring to the table, but I’m open to discussing this.\nKink\nI’m active in the Bay Area kink scene and regularly attend sex parties within my communities.\nI prefer partners with at least a baseline familiarity with kink or BDSM due to the level of communication it requires. I identify as a Dominant and connect best with partners who are submissive or switchy.\nHappy to talk more about this in person together.\nSomewhere in Sedona, AZ.\nFamily, Community, and Kids\nI grew up in rural South Carolina in a small family: parents and a brother who is 8 years older than me. I’m close with my parents and talk to them a few times a week. Despite growing up in SC, the Bay Area is my home. Any future moves would be to a similar or larger city.\nI’ve been in the Bay since 2021 and was lucky to find and grow with several amazing communities. In a group, I can equally enjoy being the person who inspires everyone into action or the one who quietly drives the car while everyone sleeps on a road trip.\nI’ve had a vasectomy and I am 85% certain I don’t want kids. I’d consider it under really unique circumstances, but if having kids is a core priority for you, I am probably not the right partner.\nTrying to keep my dad out of trouble while he tells the same joke to everyone in the grocery store.\nLifestyle, career, and hobbies\nI try to strike a balance between movement and rest (though I’m often not great at rest).\nWhen I’m active, I enjoy walking through the city, snowboarding, lifting weights, or training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. When I’m resting, I enjoy reading a Spanish novel in the park, journaling, creating music, or relaxing with friends.\nCareer-wise, I’ve built a really unusual path and enjoy aiming at something difficult or risky and finding ways to make it into a reality. I identify less with any one job and more with the idea that: hard work = way more options in life.\nI grew up playing guitar/bass in bands since age 16 and was once a professional touring musician. These days, I mostly lend my skills to campfires or house parties when requested. A few times a year, I get together with friends from across the country to go to electronic music festivals. If you have any interest, we’d love to have new people join us!\nYou can probably assume I haven’t seen a show or movie. I’ve got a few gems up my sleeve, and I’ll absolutely show up for your favorites—but I’ve been out of the loop since Game of Thrones ended.\nFind me just about anywhere: the city, the mountains, or the sea.\nAbout you\nWe might be a good fit if… (not all required)\nYou live in (or frequent) the Bay Area and are in the 25–45 range\nYou are non-monogamous and ideally have some experience with kink\nYou lean towards being warm, curious, and enjoy physical touch\nYou try to communicate well: express emotions, set boundaries, and handle conflict with care\nYou ski or snowboard\nYou lean towards being more of a morning person\nYou care deeply about something—your work, your hobbies, your community, etc\nYou try to take care of your body and mind in ways that feel good to you\nYou can be serious and silly\nSkydiving on my birthday, 10/10 would do again.\nTogether we could…\nBreak a sweat: hiking, a workout class, pilates, skiing, etc.\nBuild a playlist for our first road trip\nDiscuss the meaning of life or how to achieve world peace using memes\nSee who can make the other cry laughing first\nDance at a concert, then debrief over food and people-watching\nWander into an art gallery and pretend to be famous art critics\nSleep in, drink French press coffee, then compare our bucket list items\nCo-work across from each other and take strategic cuddle breaks\nLet’s volunteer together!\nThings that don’t work for me\nA monogamous relationship\nA communication style that takes several days to respond\nConsistently breaking plans without explanation\nYou’re deeply religious and want me to share in that\nConstantly avoiding hard or awkward conversations\nWhat’s it like to date me?\nHow I show up in relationships\nI’m a direct communicator who loves to learn and grow with others. I believe the best relationships are built intentionally–without shying away from hard conversations. I prefer regular check-ins so we can work through something early rather than let friction or resentment build in silence.\n💡\nFun facts: I run warm (great if you get cold), sleep like a rock, and have a strong grip for massages.\nI want to understand how you see the world or at least what you’re passionate about. I want us to co-create a relationship where we both feel chosen over and over again, and the cornerstone of our relationship will ideally be a strong friendship.\nIn addition, I value the fact that we both have our own lives. Whether we see each other all the time or once a month, you’ll have my full attention when we’re together.\nIt’s officially wedding and +1 season\nLove languages and romance\nThe ways I prefer to show and receive affection are very similar. I enjoy quality time, physical touch, and a steady stream of witty banter (plus the occasional bite). I love hyping up my partner and listening to your thoughts about the world.\nI’m not very big on traditional romantic gestures: giving or receiving fancy gifts, rose petals in a candlelit room, etc., but I’m working to broaden my horizons. For me, romance is about being intentional—learning what lights each other up and making sure we feel it.\nSocial settings\nYou should bring me as a +1 to your next event—I can blend in with friends, family, or coworkers and talk to anyone. I love getting into spontaneous conversations and seeing where we end up. You might think that’s from a decade of working in sales, but my parents will confirm that I’ve been a social butterfly since I was 6.\nI’m happy to stick by your side or let you do your thing while I explore the room. I don’t get separation anxiety. As long as we connect at some point, I’m good.\n🤝\nIf you get stuck in an awkward convo, I’m great at swooping in with a joke or a smooth exit.\nI am also aware that sometimes I can have too much energy for the situation. Just let me know and I am happy to regulate for the occasion.\nI don’t expect you to be big into sports, but they’re a great excuse to hang with (or make new) friends.\nHow I handle conflict and feedback\nI see conflict as an opportunity for growth, not a fight. We’re on the same team, trying to understand each other and figure out what needs to be seen. When things get tense, I stay calm and grounded so we can figure it out together.\nI don’t raise my voice during an argument. I’m not a stoic robot, but there are ways to express yourself while being respectful. I take feedback seriously, especially when it comes from a place of care. I want us to both feel comfortable sharing ways to grow.\nNaturally, I don’t weigh negative interactions as heavily as others might, so I won’t let a single bad moment define a person or a relationship. I default to assuming good intent and look at the whole picture rather than over-indexing on one issue.\nWhat are other people saying about me?\n❤️\n“Jarrett is magnetic, driven, and deeply curious! Someone who’s always reaching for more in life and invites you to do the same. Great fit for people who are ambitious, self-aware, and excited by growth and new experiences.\nIf you’re someone who coasts without much internal drive or avoids introspection, you’ll probably feel left behind. But if you love playful depth, thoughtful conversation, and someone who’s as invested in his own evolution as he is in yours, he’s an incredible person to share time with.”\n- Former primary partner\n⭐\n“Jarrett is like a golden retriever trapped in a man’s body. He is smart, kind, and gives slightly sadistic massages. If you’re kinky and/or a size queen, he’s got you covered. His worst feature is his insistence on living in SF instead of in Berkeley, but hey, nobody’s perfect.\nHe has multiple communities of friends, active hobbies, and also a great career. He has proven capable of excellent banter and custom memes. So many green flags!”\n- Regular play partner and friend\nMore reviews to come soon!\nLet’s get in touch\nIf you’ve read this far and are still curious, I’d love to hear from you.\nContact me by filling out this Google Form here."

I also enjoy my guilty pleasures: holiday movies on Netflix (lol) and iced lattes.\nI love my daily/weekly habits and I like to renew my mind, body, and soul regularly.\nI like to be challenged by travel: I want to live like the locals do, experience a radically different culture, and go on spontaneous excursions (but also I have nothing against beach vacays). I also just enjoy simple outings in new surroundings, like a local neighborhood I haven't seen yet.\nI love expressing myself through my style, and I think it's fun to develop my taste and aesthetics.\nYou can reach out to me at pavitthra.n.p@gmail.com!

      "fullText": "﻿I have a very different cultural outlook on dating than most people. So instead of a five word Tinder profile I’ve created this massive Google doc because I think it makes sense to just be frank and give people the information upfront. But hey, “Don’t laugh, it works”.    \r\n\r\n\r\nKey things:\r\n* I lean poly. I definitely open to casual dating and hookups, but I’m most interested in a long-term relationship where we mainly invest in that relationship. With a good match I could also consider monogamy. Something intermediate could also be good, like an open relationship. \r\n* I’m location flexible. I’m currently based in London, England, but also spend a significant amount of time in Vancouver, Canada (my hometown). I would consider long distance and potentially moving for the right person.\r\n* I’m open to a lot of different different things with partners (long-term, short-term, FWB, hookups, etc.). Ultimately, I feel ready for a serious relationship and that’s what I am most interested in, but I’m not desperate for one, and ready to explore and see where things lead. Since I’m poly, I’m also always going to be interested in other stuff as well\r\n* You can reach me at https://www.facebook.com/Max.Carpendale/ or maxcarpendale@Gmail.com\r\n* I’m cis and straight(ish)\r\n* I’m 34\r\n   \r\nAbout me:\r\nI have an odd combination of more macho/hardcore/adventurous interests and presentation with anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity. So if you’re looking for someone who looks tough, is strong and is into doing ambitious, daring stuff, but is a softy and sensitive, I’m your dude.\r\nI’m very ambitious throughout my life, though that certainly veers into perfectionism at times. In my career I do research for an animal advocacy org that provides research support to other organizations and tries to make them more effective. I’m very passionate about reducing suffering through my career. I’ve been vegan for ages and before that I was vegetarian for almost my whole life. I’ve been reading rationalist blogs for 18 years and I have been in the Effective Altruism movement for 14 years.\r\nI’m very sporty and really enjoy strength training, calisthenics, cycling, hiking, swimming, and bouldering. Strength training and other work on my body helps me (functionally) recover from chronic pain, so it’s a big deal for me. I also generally put a lot of effort into my health with things like healthy eating, massage, meditation, and sauna.\r\n   \r\nOther things I’m into:\r\n* Travel: always keen on exploring somewhere new, especially new countries\r\n* Metal (especially folk, black, death and doom), but you can probably tell that by looking at me 😉 and other music including folk, synthwave, punk, and postpunk. I generally like music on the experimental end of things\r\n* Horror movies/short stories (especially folk horror)\r\n* Geography/geopolitics\r\n* Philosophy (especially ethics and philosophy of mind)\r\n* Learning as much as I can about as much as I can (I listen to mostly nonfiction audiobooks any spare moment I get)\r\n* Gratitude: to appreciate this fleeting gift of life\r\n* Rationality: facing up to what’s true\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat do I offer?\r\n* I very rarely get angry in relationships or blame other people for things\r\n* I try to practice something like nonviolent communication\r\n* I can be very understanding and accommodating of mental and physical health difficulties (having had some it’s very easy to access empathy)\r\n* I am very cuddly and affectionate (love language is mostly touch and words of affirmation)\r\n* I am capable of loving deeply\r\n* I am extremely committed to self-improvement\r\n* I really like comforting people when they’re feeling down\r\n* I work out a lot, so I am fairly muscular and will likely continue to get more muscular\r\n* I’m quite interested in fashion and try to dress well\r\n* I’m quite self-aware/conscious of my faults\r\n* I like to think that I have great taste in media/art, but see below\r\n* I love to give massages (and I’m generally good with my hands 😉)\r\n* I’m very GGG\r\n* I’m location flexible\r\n   \r\nDifficulties\r\n* I am quite neurotic, specifically I have struggled most of my life with anxiety and depression\r\n* I think I’m quite good at communication at this point, but it’s something that I’ve had to learn, so I don’t naturally show as much emotion as I would like\r\n* I sometimes have an insecure attachment, so I may ask for reassurance, and highly appreciate receiving it\r\n* Because of my perfectionism, I can be quite indecisive\r\n* I have a large amount of self-doubt\r\n* I’m quite eclectic in my taste in media, so it may be hard to find overlap with people (we may not \r\nTo summarize, I’m someone who needs more reassurance than most! Having said this, I’ve been spending a lot of time on mental health, and I’ve been improving at a lot of these. These things also help me be more open and understanding of suffering in others. They also contribute to me being super committed to self-examination and improvement.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat dating me is like:  \r\nDating preferences (none of these are requirements!):\r\n* I love dates in nature. A walk in the park sounds like a great first date\r\n* I also like the idea of crazier dates (wild swimming then sauna anyone?)\r\n* I also really like cozy environments for later dates, like dinner at one of ours\r\n* I really like the idea of doing trips and holidays with someone once we are in a relationship\r\n* My anxiety centers around speaking, so I’m not the most talkative, but I’m very physically affectionate\r\n* I enjoy drinking on dates, though it’s fine if you don’t\r\n* Taking psychedelics and such once we are in a relationship sounds wonderful to me\r\n* I really enjoy check-in texts and text to share moments with each other\r\n* I also really like calls\r\n* I really enjoy kink events and the odd sex party 😜\r\n* I like burner fests/other hippie events\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to be overly prescriptive (these aren’t strict requirements or expectations by any means), but some general things I’m looking for in a partner are:\r\n* Someone who is into effective altruism\r\n* Someone who is vegan/into animal advocacy\r\n* Someone with a curiosity and intellectual engagement with the world\r\n* Someone very emotional who can feel and love deeply\r\n*  Someone who look at practices open and honest communication\r\n* Someone drawn to the darker parts of the world and darker media (metal, horror, controversial ideas, the horrible parts of history, etc.)\r\n* Someone sporty or athletic who is interested in doing things like hikes, cycling, swimming\r\n* Someone who is very sexually driven/high libido and adventurous/experimental/kinky\r\n* Someone with an alternative/metalhead/goth aesthetic\r\n* Someone ambitious and career driven\r\n* Someone who is very into travel\r\n* Someone very affectionate/cuddly\r\nI would be surprised if anyone had all of these, so don’t let that stop you from reaching out!"

What we do with it to reach our goals and create positivity is up to each of us individually. \r\nI enjoy getting outside. I love great food, good music, the elements, road trips, dogs, cats, learning and far off places.\r\nI am an extroverted introvert. I do a lot of observing out in the world and enjoy learning from others. \r\nEach new day I strive to work on my mind, body and spirit. Organized planning, diligence, time in nature along with seizing spontaneity are a priority to continue to grow a life of adventure and aspirations.\r\nOne of my favorite road trips was a two week trip around Utah with my buddy Jake   \r\nEveryone that knows me knows Jake was not far behind. He had more adventures in his time here than many humans do. \r\nI plan on doing many more adventures and hope to do so with my future husband. \r\nAs much as I enjoy peace and quiet I love Rock and Roll while driving. It helps me find my center in the middle of a traffic jam. \r\nIf your life is country line dancing, you keep enjoying that-without me. The same for pickleball.

He has lived his life fulfilling his goals for himself and is in a place where he is ready to share his future with me. He wants to continue to grow and learn and have a good time doing it together. I want to be with someone who has already had the experience of marriage and children, since he already knows what works and what doesn’t. I get joy from supporting my man through his triumphs and being there when the chips are down. \r\nI’m a sucker for clean cut men. I appreciate everyone has their own look and style. I am a bit old fashioned, for me chivalry isn’t dead. I like to feel not only cared about but cared for.  I want to wake up every day happy to be sharing the morning and what good we will make in the world that day. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout you…what are  your relationship\r\nGoals\r\nHopes\r\nAspirations\r\nEmail: michelledenmaar@gmail.com\r\n-age 57 looking for man  58-68\r\n-Phoenix area \r\n-parent of independent adult children\r\n-sense of humor necessary"

      "fullText": "﻿Hey, I’m Terrence!\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a great person who makes a great life even better. I appreciate a shared laugh, an inside joke, affection, and quality conversation. I love to learn what motivates people and what makes them happy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy current side quests include: distance swimming, acroyoga, jiujitsu, strength training, poker, and philanthropy.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would we be like together?\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally our lives would incorporate adventures in the great outdoors, socialization and games with friends, some amount of travel, and generally great times. \r\n \r\nI’m a big believer of putting in the emotional effort and communication required for a successful relationship and hope that my partner would be too. I’m also looking for a partner who considers herself a lifelong learner and a person with at least a moderate interest in fitness/physical activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you a scrub? A scrub is a guy that can’t get no love from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only work I do now is full remote and (very) part-time. I am fortunate enough to have exited the 9-5 world and continuously grateful that I get to only do things I find enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn past lives I was a poker startup executive and consultant, a professional poker player, and a professional MMA fighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily plans?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have two amazing, brilliant children and a positive relationship with their mother. I am open to more biological children if that is a strong desire of yours. (I also have frozen sperm and an embryo which is a biological sibling of my kids.) I am willing (and would be very happy!) to enter a blended family situation once a long-term relationship between us has been established.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do you live?\r\n\r\n\r\nKelowna, British Columbia is a rapidly growing city (pop. 160k) with a beautiful lake dotted with world-class ski hills, vineyards, and trails. It is big enough to have the important urban things, and small enough not to have suffocating traffic and congestion. We have direct flights to/from Seattle, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and some Mexican resort towns. \r\n\r\n\r\nKelowna is in Canada, whose head of state is a sane human. If you desire to become a citizen where the head of state is a sane human, then marriage/citizenship is on the table. Just sayin’.\r\n\r\n\r\nDang, that’s too far!\r\n\r\n\r\nFair enough. I’m down to do some chatting and video calling to see if it’s worth pursuing a long-distance relationship, but I understand that’s not for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! If you think we’d be great together, send an email! terrencechan00@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nLast update: May 14, 2025."

I grew up in North Carolina and currently live in Chapel Hill, home of the Tar Heels!  I’m interested in meeting a woman, settling down, and having a family.  If that suits you, then read the other sections below!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me: josephparrishnc@gmail.com\r\nReach out on X: https://x.com/MisterAccord\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Profile: Because we know it matters\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHeight\r\n\t5’6’’\r\n\tHair Color\r\n\tDirty Blond\r\n\tEye Color\r\n\tBlue\r\n\tStyle\r\n\tMilitary Haircut, Black Clothes\r\n\tFitness\r\n\tSlim, Slightly Muscular\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional headshot, June 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPlaying pool at a local bar, May 2025 (very recent).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBest Man at my best friend’s wedding, February 2023.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional Profile: What does he even do?\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a freelance stock analyst.  In simple terms, I write and publish my opinions about stocks and similar investments.  Here’s an excerpt from a recent article of mine:\r\n\r\n\r\nWith short-term rates over 4% right now, it's not too bold to assume that Spire could actually generate interest income of about $8M while holding that cash (depending on what total 2025 capex is). The table earlier showed very little for maintenance capex, most being for contract-specific projects. I don't expect their $200M+ cash balance is going to be burned quickly.\r\n  \r\n\r\nProbably Greek to you if you’re not into investing.  By writing, I get to monetize my own research process, which I do anyway for my personal investing.  This way I don’t have to take any money out of my portfolio and can focus on growing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAm I a millionaire?  Nope.  I gross about $25K writing these articles and make that work by living frugally for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like being self-employed a lot more than working for someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nI put that in bold just so you know that I’m done with grueling work for employers that don’t appreciate their staff.  I have enough to meet my needs, get plenty of sleep, and not have to rush anywhere anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent goals:\r\n* Grow my reader following/article earnings\r\n* Branch into other investing content\r\n* Join the Board of Directors of a local corporation in Chapel Hill\r\n* Perhaps start a business with the woman I meet!\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies: Who told him he could have fun?\r\n\r\n\r\nGames: Like many millennials, I like video games.  I mostly play older ones.  I also dislike being indoors too much and will go outside.  I play pool, a newer hobby of mine.  It’s physical but doesn’t rely on good weather or having a lot of people present.  I go to a lot of local board game events too.\r\n\r\n\r\nTV/Movies: I don’t watch a lot of movies or shows lately.  Usually I do that if I’m watching with someone else.  I like historical dramas, especially those pertaining to the Renaissance or Middle Ages.  My favorite films are The Lord of the Rings.  I especially like to watch comedies, and I’m always looking for another laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic: I like an eclectic mixture of things, but I think I’ve found a preference toward old school rock/pop.  That includes Queen, Elton John, The Beatles, Beach Boys.  Of course, I love anything that’s a millennial anthem!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArt: Occasionally, I make art on Microsoft Paint.  See above.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: I like coffee and tea.  I like trail walks and laying in the grass.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThings You May Not Like: I mean, I ain’t perfect\r\n\r\n\r\nI figure it’s fair to list some things that may rub some women the wrong way and save everyone time.  Am I ashamed of these things?  Nope.  There will be a list of good things in the next section.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I don’t drink alcohol.  I can say why, but it wouldn’t be anything you don’t already know about alcohol.  I have never consumed it, and I never will.  I also don’t smoke or do drugs, but those are usually good things.\r\n2. I have very little dating experience.  Since adolescence, I’ve had one girlfriend, and that lasted about two months in 2020.  I’ve had one other first date in early 2024, and I didn’t get a second.  Most of dating and romance is still new to me.\r\n3. I am a virgin.  Could have guessed this with #2, but why leave you guessing?\r\n4. I used to live in my car.  There’s a reason I got into finance and investing.  For six months, I lived in the back of my car after I came close to running out of money when my previous pursuits didn’t get anywhere.  Consequently, I am very careful with how much I spend, and some might think penny pinching isn’t very fun.\r\n5. I no longer speak to my mother.  This began in 2017, and I intend to keep this up for life.  There were problems in my household of which she was the cause, and this was my best remedy without getting caught in a cycle.\r\n6. I don’t vote anymore.  I used to be very political.  Now I’m not, and I’m content to let anything happen.  If you’re passionate about certain issues, just know that I won’t be.\r\n7. I don’t celebrate birthdays or most holidays.  For reasons related to why I stopped speaking to my mother, most of these days stopped being fun a long time ago.  What I usually do is give someone a gift when I see an opportunity.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings You Will Probably Like: Wait, what if I am perfect?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I don’t yell at people.  The good news is that eliminating negativity in my life means I stopped yelling and arguing.  It’s been years since I yelled at anyone, and it feels great.  Instead, I just ask why someone feels the way they do and talk about it.\r\n2. I give massages.  My ex-girlfriend said I was her only boyfriend that would give massages without expecting sex from it.  I guess that was a bad deal for me, but she sure enjoyed it, and now you can too!\r\n3. I have no debt.  Don’t think this requires elaboration.\r\n4. My schedule is very flexible.  Being self-employed, I can work anywhere at pretty much any time.  It should be easy for us to make plans that suit you.\r\n5. I invented Mexican spaghetti.  It’s spaghetti but Mexican.  I can also bake biscuits.\r\n6. I have a cool, older sister.  She will do fun stuff with us.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Seeking: Hope you made it this far!\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, I want a partner in life who will have children with me.  I’m looking for someone who is under 30-years-old, is in good health (doesn’t smoke, healthy weight), isn’t bad with money, and has a good attitude.  I’m not picky about your religion.  I’m not picky about your career.  I’m not picky about how educated you are.  As long as these things don’t make you rigid, it can work."

      "fullText": "﻿Tab 1\r\nAbout Me  \r\nHello, I’m Baram![1] I was born in 1995; I grew up in New England, mainly Massachusetts, also spending a few years in Israel when I was younger. I did my undergrad in math and CS at the University of Maryland, then got a PhD in mathematical neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh. I recently moved to Berkeley to work on AI safety research. I was raised a Modern Orthodox Jew; I’m now an atheist. I’m looking for a monogamous relationship and ultimately to raise a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Last updated 9/16/25)\r\nPersonality\r\n* Low extraversion, high conscientiousness, high-ish agreeableness, low-ish neuroticism, high openness\r\n* My MBTI is IXTJ, “X” because the test I took put me roughly in the middle of that axis (traits are normally distributed, who knew)\r\n Beliefs & Values\r\n* I generally value conscientiousness, integrity, learning, self-improvement, and working on something impactful.\r\n* Rationalist; I think the Sequences are great. I’m not sure I totally identify as an EA, but still I’m pretty aligned with them.\r\n* My diet is currently somewhere halfway between vegetarian and vegan.\r\n* My politics are generally liberal/libertarian-ish. I don’t have a problem with some political disagreement, but in practice, if you’re a Trump supporter or a leftist we’re probably just not going to get along very well.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies & Interests\r\n* Space, AI, tech, math, neuroscience, science in general\r\n* Classical music: I play piano (poorly) and write music (slightly less poorly).[2] I used to play violin (also poorly), but haven’t picked it up in a while. I almost exclusively listen to classical music (that one I think I’m pretty good at!).\r\n* Reading: mainly history and sci-fi, but occasionally science, philosophy, and other subjects.[3]\r\n* Camping, hiking, backpacking.\r\n* I picked up bouldering over the past few years, along with everyone else on the planet.\r\n* Board games, chess, DnD, MTG; which one I’m most engaged in tends to depend on my social scene.\r\n* I generally unwind by reading blogs,[4] watching youtube, or playing video games.\r\nLifestyle\r\n* I’m fairly neat.\r\n* I’m generally a homebody.\r\n* I tend to be open with people I know well, but very private otherwise: I generally dislike posting things online,[5] and use social media exclusively for individual or group chats.\r\n* I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs, although depending on the particulars it might be fine if you do.\r\n* While I like hiking and bouldering, I’m not really athletic, and don’t generally enjoy working out.\r\n* I have very minimal exposure to popular culture: I only listen to classical music, and I watch very few movies or TV shows.\r\n* I’m not really a foodie: I enjoy good food when I have it, but I don’t find it very motivating and don’t really go out of my way to get it.\r\n* I’ve traveled a bit and enjoyed myself, and I’m planning on travelling more soon, but in general it’s not a major priority for me.\r\n* I’m not a dog person: I don’t mind other people’s dogs, but I don’t want to take care of one. I like cats and some other pets, though.\r\n* My sleep schedule is currently something like 11:30pm-7:30am. I’m not a morning person.\r\n* I do not like beaches; mountains and forests are great.\r\n* I much prefer cooler weather to hot weather.\r\nMiscellaneous \r\n* I’m 5’10”.\r\n* My financial situation is, in all honesty, not particularly great at the moment. While I don’t have too much student debt, I wasn’t earning much during grad school, and I’m currently working on research independently with grant funding from some EA orgs while I look for more permanent employment. (On the plus side, I don’t have any particularly expensive hobbies besides “living in the Bay Area”.)\r\n* I used to be mostly fluent in Hebrew when I was a kid, but at this point it’s very rusty.\r\n* While my extended family is pretty small, I have three siblings who mean the world to me.\r\nLooking For\r\n* I’m looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, and ultimately a life partner.\r\n* I’d like to have kids at some point. I’m open to waiting for that, but I’m also open to starting a family within the next few years if I find the right person.\r\n* I’m looking for someone I can have interesting conversations with; I don’t have a checklist but some degree of overlap with my values and interests is obviously a plus.\r\n* I tend to take things fairly slowly in relationships.\r\n* I’m looking for an emotional/personal connection much more than a physical one; sex isn’t a very high priority for me (though of course nice to have).\r\n   * I am into kink (switch). But as I said, this is a fairly low priority – it isn’t a strict requirement for me that you also be into this, I think something more vanilla is fine too.\r\n* Regarding location, I’m currently in the Bay Area because it’s the best place to do AI safety research, and I like the large rationalist community here. However, my family and friends are mainly in the Northeast, so I’m open to potentially moving back there in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve read this far and are still interested, get in touch!

No promises on whether it’ll be good.\r\n[3] Fair warning, I come from a long line of book hoarders. I sold half my collection when moving to the Bay and it was devastating.\r\n[4]Mainly ACX, Don't Worry About the Vase, Overcoming Bias, Gwern, Knowingless, Aceso Under Glass, LessWrong, Noahpinion, Slow Boring, Silver Bulletin, ACOUP, Casey Handmer, Shtetl-Optimized, Statistical Modeling, Roots of Progress, Comment is Freed (the Lawrence Freedman half), Tracing Woodgrains, Terry Tao, and of course various AI-related newsletters. Note that I don’t 100% endorse all of these.\r\n[5]Yes, I hate writing this, thanks for asking."

      "fullText": "﻿David’s Date-Me Doc 💙\r\nWho I am: \r\nHi, I’m David — a warm, creative, emotionally intelligent guy with a Master’s degree in Public Relations and a passion for storytelling, theatre, and meaningful connection. I’m the kind of person who’ll send you a voice memo about a weird Broadway fact, help your friend write a killer résumé, or walk across the city just to find the perfect cup of coffee.\r\nI’m left-leaning, proudly pro-therapy, neurodivergent-friendly, and I care deeply about equity, kindness, and communication. I love getting into deep conversations, finding the humor in hard things, and watching relationships unfold at their own pace.\r\nRight now, I’m based in South Florida. But I’m ready for my next adventure — ideally in New York, or wherever life and love might lead.\r\nWhat I’m Into: \r\n* Broadway — Favorites include The Producers, In the Heights, West Side Story, Hadestown, and Spring Awakening\r\n* Pop culture & political satire — Think SNL, BoJack Horseman, South Park, The Daily Show, Schitt’s Creek, The Office, Seinfeld\r\n* Creative projects — Producing and writing new musicals, contributing to BroadwayWorld, and experimenting with new recipes\r\n* Cozy nights in — Home-cooked meals + something binge-worthy = ideal\r\n* Personal growth — Emotional literacy, therapy, and being a good listener\r\n* Singing — I’m a tenor who helps friends with voice auditions\r\n* Aimless city walks — Especially along the water\r\nWhat am I doing now?\r\nFor the past six years, I’ve run my own PR agency, working with performing arts and nonprofit clients. I also recently became a licensed Realtor with Coldwell Banker and continue to sing professionally with my Episcopal church choir.

I absolutely adore computer science and technology, but I studied economics and accounting. I have another diploma in law (both from Russia) and I am thinking of getting MBA somewhere abroad.\nI have many other things I like (or liked) to do, like dancing, visiting theatre, walking and hiking, meeting friends and new people, deep talks, creating dj-sets, playing piano, making podcasts, writing stories and translation of lyrics (refer to Vladimir Mayakovsky “To Lilichka” and “Marusya took a poison”, there was something else in english) , planting flowers, studying, venture and startups meeting, etc.etc.\nI prefer not to say “I dream about” as I dont like to dream, I like to plan and do.\nMy favourite writers are: Amitav Ghosh, Tolstoy, Pushkin, Markes, Rushdi… I absolutely adore Amir Khusrau Dehlevi - this guy I would talk to (and I still hope to visit his memory place in Delhi). Non-fiction - Nikolay Gumilev with his theory of ethnogenesis.\nMusic is the sea, I love a lot from liquid funk to opera, its easier to say what I never listen: hard rock, simple pop-music, rap.\nFilms and TV-series: Troy, Polititian, Silicon Valley. No to thrillers and absolute no to horror movies.\nWhat else? I have never been married and dont have children (thats why), but I would like to create a family with a proper person, though its not my “do or die”. I support traditional values: children after marriage only and no divorce.\nReligion. I was born as an orthodox, but I studied all the religions trying to explore spirituality. I like 2 sayings of unnamed rebbaes:\nBorders of religions do not reach the God\nSome more facts about me:\nI have been living for about 6 months in Sri-Lanka in 2023. I would never stay there for so long as surfing did not work for me, but I started to study gemology there and I was thinking abount starting a gems business. Maybe I return to this idea, if I move to USA or Asia.\nI was involved in a start-ups (as a consultant) and venture activities during covid (I was an operational leader of Founders Institute in Moscow)\nI wrote my own podcasts talking to interesting people and discussing the ideas they follow and businesses they build\nI consulted people on their businesses development\nIf you ask me what is my astrology sign, I’ll ask you back which one you mean: the sun, the moon or stellium, etc. But I never read horoscopes as self-programming works better then them.\nI don’t like “transfer tourism” and banal routes. I prefer longer trips and immersion in local culture.\nI have never been to Americas  and China and some places of Europe.\nWhen I visit new cities, I go to museums, and historical sites, art galleries and try to see at least one movie with sublitles in the cinema.\nI don’t drive.\nBrief:\nCats or dogs - cats. Dogs are also nice, but I would prefer not to have animals at home.\nTea or coffe. Tea. I dont consider overcoffee healthy, but sometimes I use it as a treatment\nBack-end or Front-end. Back end. I prefer logic behind appearance.\nWhat I am waiting from my life partner:\nAppearance. I dont mind how exactly you look, I dont have any special appearance fetishes. But if you are sporty (I don’t mean a mountain of muscles - this is not what I want to hug) it increases the chances.\nСharacter traits. 3 features are  the must in my future man: he is generous, he is a family man, he loves me. Actually I cheated with generosity as it includes some other features like kindness and adulthood.\nIntelligence. Which is not just a diploma or PhD (I do not underestimate it, but I did not defend my own thesis after I wrote and pre-defended it, as I don’t mind papers, I mind knowledge).\nWhat is absolutely improper for me:\nAny kind of addiction. I can accept experiments, but I prefer wisdom and will\nTell me what book(s) or movie(s) or person/subject/idea  would you like to discuss, if  you decide to drop me a mail to profitometrika@gmail.com\nM\nMaria Marshakova\nApr 29 (edited)\nhere is me having fun being excited before my last vacation in March ‘25.\nAnd, for the beginning, I am:\n- INTP\n- russian\n- 42 y.o.

      "fullText": "Dillon's Dating Profile - Blog\nDillon's Dating Profile\nBlog\nAbout\nContact\nDetailed written profile below pictures. @dwpaulDE (public) for more pictures. Video can be skipped as all content in it is included in text below.\n6/2/2024\n60 Comments\nTL;DR\n43 year old, 6'3\" ER physician turned investor/businessman looking across the US for a woman to support and complement in life partnership and children. Ideally kind, virtuous, ambitious, emotionally mature, and open to and likely able to have 3 or more biological kids (surrogacy is fine), but I am flexible on all but the deal breakers mentioned below. I am well groomed for the demands of being a husband and father. Flexible in terms of location as I am happy to bear all the costs (and time) of traveling for dates and moving as well.​\n😀​\nWhy should you read this and the FAQ?\nI am following the golden rule of doing on to others as I would have them do unto me. I wish others provided more information (who they are, values, future goals, and preferences for dating and a partner) to help us figure out compatibility and interest. I do understand that many are initially turned off, confused, and triggered by this approach, but it's the best solution I've found to help manage the excessive time moving through the large volume of people looking for a mutually ideal life partner.\nPlease let me know if you have any ideas for other helpful information to include.\nPublic Social Media Accounts\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dwpaulde/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-paul-md-b238a684/\n​\nhttps://www.facebook.com/woodchuck\nStrategy:\nI (like many) am overwhelmed by the abundance and inefficiency of online dating, particularly the many vague and superficial profiles and lack of forthrightness that make it difficult to determine with whom we would be interested in connecting. To help streamline the process, I created this website to outline information about me, my preferred strategy (but I'm fine with accommodating yours as well), and what I look for in women to date. My hope is to reduce the frequency of basic questions and help make it easier for the women who have aligned values, goals, interests, and personality find me for dating, friendship, and/or networking.\nI am willing to go Kelce for Swift style with my phone number on a bracelet if you help me identify my Swift.\nDating:\nMy home base is in Dallas, TX, but I’m mobile and am happy to do any traveling/moving to make dating and relationships easier for the hardworking, ambitious, and successful women with whom I like connecting. I will re-emphasize this because it's unusual and can be a source of confusion, but I am happy to take on all the time and expense, and uproot my location for women I want to meet and then ultimately the woman whose heart I want to win. I have gone on dates throughout the country and even moved to Omaha where my last girlfriend lived once we became exclusive.\nMy Dating Mantra:\nDating is not just a means to finding a life partner, but a more dynamic process. Most won’t be the “one” and some may not be compatible romantically, but wins come in friends, business contacts, sports/hobby companions, partners for our friends, and other networking. And incremental growth or being touched by or touching the life of others happens more than we realize. We shouldn't become overly focused on finding our life partners without appreciating and being open to the many wins along the way.\n​\nDeal Breakers\n\nI don’t date those with previous children and don't date those not wanting children or those not interested or difficulty having 3 or more biological children, although I'm fine with surrogacy and even egg donation if bad luck prevails for my partner and I.\n\nI also don't date those with active substance abuse or history of addiction/dependence, but truthfully I also try to identify and avoid other characteristics suggestive of active or high risk of global life dysfunction, as I like women that function at high levels.\n\nI want a partner who believes they can be comfortable with aborting a pregnancy with genetic concerns identified on prenatal testing (for example, Down syndrome but many others identifiable). I apologize in advance to the many who will find this offensive and disrespectful to a politically, religiously, socially, and emotionally loaded topic. I respect the woman's ultimate right to choose and change her mind on this issue once they are pregnant (and others right to believe no one should be allowed to have this choice) and would work through the issue at that time, but I'd prefer to find someone who believes they are inclined to this decision as I’d like to do everything I can to avoid committing to a life long union with a woman who ultimately holds the sole decision making of bringing a high needs child into the world, which I feel strongly is something I want to avoid with use of modern technology and have no ethical concerns with such, nor do many women I meet..\n​\nStrengths as a Partner and Potential Father\nGrowth mindset, kind, high integrity/honesty/loyal, ambitious, emotionally mature/supportive, fun, strong intellect, financially secure, physically and mentally healthy with strong coping skills, moderately athletic, resilient, come from a good family, former children's ski school instructor.\nWeaknesses:\nAttention deficit disorder (disorganized and distractible)\nDescription of Me:\nAge: 43\nHeight: 6’3\"\nWeight: 188-200 lbs\nEyes: hazel/green/blue?\nHoodie: waiting for you to steal\n​\nI am a nonspiritual, business owner, investor, and emergency physician emeritus who hasn't practiced clinical medicine for over 3 years due to a re-shifting of priorities and interests after transitioning from my most successful investment to date, which re-shifted my financial needs, goals, and position. I dedicate my time and energy to investing, working on myself (being coached, personal growth, improving EQ, communication, and confidence, etc), and finding a life partner (settling down and having a family).  I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, but my family is now in Tucson area [Dad (civil engineer who has an architectural degree as well), mom (retired physician assistant and former assister in regulatory compliance for agrochemical industry), uncle (sports medicine doctor), aunts (nurse midwife and retired former librarian)], Boulder area (nonbiological Bosnian exchange student brother who lived with family in high school and his wife and daughter), and Altadena [greater Los Angeles where sister (partner at big law), brother-in-law (accountant focusing on accounting software development), niece live]. I have no kids and have never been married (engaged for a month to my first girlfriend). I want kids, with current inclination to be as many to which my partner is agreeable (3 or more preferably but obviously to be reassessed together as we go) and I'm fine with surrogate and open to egg donation in the unfortunate event it's needed. I don't use any illicit substances including drinking very rarely. My parents and myself are allergic to cats and although I've never been against dating someone with a cat, I have never done so and feel like I should at least mention it as some cat owners apparently do not want to date people with allergies to them.\nFinancial, Management, and Labor Distribution:\nI am a VHNWI (maybe between 13-25 M although I don't keep close tabs and these things fluctuate and are hard to estimate when it represents large holdings of private businesses and volatile stocks). I live a simple and inexpensive life independently and expect to be flexible to the complexities and can easily afford the expenses desired by most women and plan to invest heavily on my children's education and assistance with many of the time consuming and tedious tasks of child rearing. However, I like women who I respect and can make significant contributions themselves, so it feels like a strong and balanced partnership and am drawn to successful and ambitious women such as those in finance, lawyers, executives, engineers, entrepreneurs, and doctors. I do appreciate women who are financially successful and thrive and are valuable in our capitalistic world and I believe there are benefits in terms of lowering financial risks for both parties in the unfortunate event of divorce\n(which I have put a lot of effort in to learning how to avoid)\nand imagine there is a more balanced dynamic when both partners are financially secure and thriving. I am also thankful of the additional modeling and genes for the children and strength it provides for the family unit. Although I come from a family where the men and women work full time throughout childrearing with the exception of maternity/paternity leave, I am open to communication and flexibility in finding the best dynamic for our family. I don't need to work and have few requirements on my time as is. However, I don't consider management and operations to be my greatest skill and do often utilize the management of people around me who are better at it and suspect that much of the family and household management may be best executed by my partner and she may want to focus on it more once having had children having come from a family background where that was the case for her. All this to say that I am open to any arrangements here that is equitable and makes sense for us.\nValues and Transparency:\nI am interested in investing my time, energy, and money in principled women, so I like to be able to have strong indications of values, aspirations, history, and/or interests. I prefer transparency upfront, to help us see whether we are interested in developing a connection and getting to know each other further.\nPolitics:\nI come from a progressive family and schooling and focus on respect, but avoid proselytizing about my support for sustainability, LGBT, and pro-choice to name a few. I am open and non-judgmental in immediately sharing any seemingly invasive information others find helpful to identify dates, life partners, or other people with whom they would like to make a meaningful connection, so I prefer you jump right in as I appreciate directness.\nPast Relationship Positive Feedback:\nOff the cuff feedback from an ex-gf: emotionally available, secure attachment, handled personal finance/investing for her, taught her skiing (and I'll add I'm happy to teach all sports or anything: circle of competences listed elsewhere), loyal, honest, funny (especially funny when not trying to be), moms love me, prioritize being available for loved ones when requested, generally respectful of strong opinions of which I disagree, non-confrontational, and not a yeller. Can provide additional feedback from her on any specific factors you'd like to know before dating (including the things I needed to work on which are listed in the FAQ) or you can speak to her directly if you'd like, although it was my first relationship and I've grown enormously since then as it ended about 6 years ago.\nReviews:\nTwo Female Friends:\nKind-hearted and genuinely good person with strong morals, good manners, reliable, caring, loyal, honest, smart, ambitious, and cute. I met both online dating and dated one. Can connect you with them if desired.\nRecent review after 3 dates:\n\"You're very sweet, kind, considerate, generous, honest, and well-intentioned. I also appreciate how much effort you put in to wanting to understand me and get to know me for me. That's quite rare and not something I take for granted. You treat me very well. Thank you\n🥺. I feel lucky to have crossed paths with you.\" She didn't develop any romantic interest though 🤷🏼‍♂️ and that was someone who was too emotionally taxing to maintain contact with.\nInterests:\nplaying sports 🥏⚽️🏀🎾🏐🏓⛷🏂🏄‍♂️🏋🏼‍♂️🤾🏼🏊🏻🚵🏼 pickleball and games. I exercise daily, often through team sports (currently basketball and ultimate frisbee most frequently) and weightlifting. Business, investing, and Warren Buffett have become recent passions over the last couple years, but I've had previous phases I've gone through in triathlons, personal finance, critically acclaimed rock music, emergency medicine, resuscitation, emergency airway management, procedural cadaver labs, etc. Self-improvement is a driver for me and my current focus has been emotional intelligence, dating, fostering attraction, and other soft skills for dating, many which have resulted in growth in areas outside those realms by improving all interactions and relationships. Family, friends, sustainability, honesty, acting in good faith, and simplicity are also core values for me. My parents have a vacation home in Keystone (2 hours from Denver in the Colorado Rockies) that I have frequented in the summers and winters since I was a kid and my father grew up vacationing with his parents in the area as well and my father and his brother both worked for the resort after college where I worked as well as children's ski school instructor, reservation sales agent, waiter, and bell hop/valet. My maternal grandmother also grew up not to far away and I was named after the town of Dillon where my grandfather's vacation condo was in a town close by Keystone.\nMy Future Goals:\nHaving an amazing family unit and multilingual kids with good values who bring a lot of good to this world. Developing a network of amazing and admirable people with exceptional values. At this point, I hope to become an exceptional investor and progress to investing for my family, then friends once I develop a strong and persistent track record with my own funds. Increasing my value through personal growth, expanding my circle of competence, interpersonal skills and connections, and being especially compassionate and kind to be the best influence in this world.\nHow I Identify People to Date:\nFor those contacting me outside of a dating applications I find it incredibly helpful to be contacted with pictures of a dating app profile or written material that includes the location, height, occupation (including aspirations), age, strong/rigid/important religious/cultural/personal beliefs, and interests of those wanting to date or network. I do look for and find helpful discussion of common values (integrity, kindness, ambition, mental/physical/financial health, personal growth, and athletic background and interests  are unnecessary, but very appealing as playing sports is my preferred recreation) or other commonalities to those I’ve listed. I seek smart, successful, ambitious, and enterprising women for dating, friends, and contacts as I love people who are better than me and teach me things in their circles of competence and try to teach others in mine as well.\nI do prefer to exchange pictures as well and hope that they fully represent a realistic appearance as I've attempted to do in my pictures above.\n​In the spirit of full disclosure, I set my online dating filters to 34 (I was up to 40, but it became to time consuming and emotionally taxing looking for women who have done fertility planning with frozen eggs and asking for the information upfront) or less and 5’4” or taller (but I make adjustments sometimes). I like to know about any fertility planning (or openness to such) up front especially in those older than 33 because I'd like to have 3 or more biological children with my partner, although I'm open to surrogacy and egg donation (if unlucky circumstances occur for the later or if you know where you could get eggs as good as your own as I'm not sure what this process looks like yet).  I'm also in the process of freezing my sperm (although I'm fine with IVF and sperm donor in the unlikely event it's needed or even if my partner would simply prefer someone with better genes than myself as I'm not particular on my children being genetically related, however I do want to have input in to the genes and therefore want to avoid adoption).\nFeel free to simply send screenshots of your online dating profile for your convenience as it's an easy way to use your time efficiently. Anything else that you’re willing to share about who you are and what you want to know is enthusiastically encouraged.\n​Other Things I like to know:\n Anything that makes you a great partner. Please don’t be humble! I hate missing the opportunity to meet amazing women, but there are too many of you and one of the most difficult issues is efficiently identifying the exceptional women who are personality, goal, and value aligned who I should pursue. Detailed and transparent profiles and forthright communication is greatly appreciated. I created this website with all the information I'd think might be helpful for you to assess our compatibility. I'd happily look through any material or social media you would provide me. I only delay acquiring the information I want about women to avoid triggering or making women uncomfortable with direct questions that may tap in to their insecurities, desire for privacy/safety, and inclinations towards typical social conventions for escalation of trust and revealing who we are.\n Anything that is helpful for you to decide whether you are interested in someone as a date or life partner, so I can provide the information that helps you along your journey.\n\nI'd prefer to know your balance sheet (net worth) and cash flows (yearly earnings), although I hesitate to ask in person as most aren't as comfortable sharing them as early as I am, nor is it considered socially appropriate upon first meeting by most people's standards. I'd also love to know your opinions and flexibility on finances as they relate to relationships. If luxury, showing off, and keeping up with the joneses is a priority for you or you like to live above the means you can personally afford on your own, then we probably aren't a good match.\n\nStrong, rigid, and/or important political, religious, cultural, and personal beliefs.\n I am interested in how and to what extent you have invested time and energy in your own knowledge and skills and demonstrated ambition, diligence, resilience, growth, and success in your life and growing interpersonal relationships and your current hopes for the future (career, family, etc).\n I like to know athletic background, interests, and/or willingness for such, but don’t require any because, I love to teach and have independent hobbies. I don't insist on my partner having the same interests and proclivities, but do like to know about this as a potential way to connect.\n I like women who are kind, virtuous, optimistic, and have strong interpersonal/communication skills, and have a high potential for growth individually and as a couple.\nFurther Professional Pursuits\nI'm a couple years in to investing in to individual stocks which I started with an online investment group which focuses on marine shipping and energy with a luckily timed shipping sector bull run followed by an unfortunate market diverging bear run for the sectors. Certainly, some interesting wins (biggest a micocap that I 10x'ed that was the stock for which had been involved in a reverse merger), lots of learning, and educational losses. I helped manage a fraud lawsuit against a majority shareholder and his manager at a free standing emergency room practice who constructed a fraud scheme against their physician minority shareholders. I am also the lead angel investor in my friend/former resident's medical device startup (\nhttps://www.endeavormedcorp.com/\n), considering taking up a board seat and other positions at companies in my industry (emergency medical practice facilities), and helped with initial capital investment on a 25-year-old's investment partnership after we connected on Reddit in a common interest in Chinese microcap credit service companies, one of which I visited while I was in China with an ex-girlfriend (oddly, the net current assets minus debt were worth more than the entire value of this very profitable and growing company and value of the company was only ~1.5 time the earnings like what was occasionally seen by Benjamin Graham during bear markets in the US decades ago).​\nFAQ\nWhy are you still single?\nI think this continues to be the most frequent question I get even when I try my best to fully address it here. It's a complex answer for everyone and reflects their past dating and relationship history. I didn't really start my journey in dating, intimacy, and relationships until I was about 30 and finishing emergency medicine residency and so I had much to learn in that time as I had limited experience with physical and emotional intimacy including no prior girlfriend or sex before. People seem to assume it's because I was focused on career, which has some truth to it, but primarily I avoided all those things because I found them scary and anxiety inducing leading to almost complete avoidance and figured they would be easier if I had a strong career and financial situation to make me a better dating candidate (but now realize how complicated and slow the process is and wish I had started the journey sooner). I describe my relationship history and timeline in other FAQs below that try to tackle why they didn't lead to life partnership. The newest evolution of my website strategy started about July 2024 after ending the relationship with my 4th girlfriend and I've continued to try to find ways to improve the process and outcome with some neglect for social conventions. I have had two significant relationships since then, one being my first experience dating someone with excellent intellectual, emotional, value, and goal compatibility, but for whom I had no sexual attraction. That dating lasted about 3 months, although we are still friends. I also dated another wonderful women for 3-4 months, but felt too much pressure to move the relationship along at her pace rather than what was consistent with my preferences and didn't feel emotionally safe expressing my thoughts and feelings on these topics as they were emotionally triggering for her (although I admittedly still should have tried harder to push through this, but continue to need to develop this skill as it's incredibly important for my ultimate success). I do feel I'm getting close and making great progress in improving my emotional intelligence, communication, understanding of what I want, and how to attract and identify the right women as the women I date are better with time and I am more capable and confident with them, although it's recurrently tough to fully appreciate the extent of my blind spots and opportunities for improvement and so I'm constantly humbled by how much I have and continue to learn.\nOne IG dating coach mentions that finding a life partner isn't easy for anyone and doesn't like this question and I agree it is very open ended and complex to answer accurately and succinctly, as well as makes some feel on the spot or judged but probably is a useful exercise of reflection. I don't ask it much of others anymore, although I am curious about women's past and relationship history that demonstrates skills, scars, and emotional maturity they might have. There are certainly infinite things that contribute to me being single, which as for most people also entails that I want to both to find the best partner for me (and the women I like are very popular with lots of interest/competition for their time and attention and already in relationships) and be the best partner for someone as well. Below I describe what has stopped women from dating or continuing to date me which I uncommonly get feedback on, but appreciate when I do. Certainly I have a long list already mentioned for why I have been uninterested in or stopped dating many others:\n1)\nI like using this website and other initial online dating strategies to save time and it probably pushes many women away from ever meeting that might be a great match. However, I can't convince myself it is worth stopping because I feel it saves me much time and manages the huge volume of women online so I get a better fit for people who overcome this ubiquitous initial reaction that is commonly shared with me as this website consolidates many of the topics that are usually covered during the in person dating process. Still I have had some women who are surprised how normal I am in person having gotten their first impression from this website and have advised me to get rid or it or let them revise it.\n2)\nI'm infinitely curious for all the reasons various women aren't interested and try to get as much feedback as I can, which is incredibly varied and limited. Here is a list off the top of my head:\na) this website makes me seem too strange, socially divergent, unaccepting, not accommodating, etc\nb) I am too old for their preferences\nc) They want to date someone who already lives near rather than someone whom will travel and move for dating and a relationship, even though I emphasize my life situation is very amenable to location flexibility.\nd) They are not on the same page with deal breakers such as unwilling to have more than 2 children or undergo prenatal testing or an elective abortion for an unhealthy pregnancy such as one with Down syndrome.\ne) They didn't feel chemistry on the first date.\nf) They don't want to date someone with any hint of avoidant dismissive tendencies even if I have a history of secure attachment and know and continue to learn how to manage it well in dating and relationships.\ng) would not date me because of my fertility/age preference out of principle even though she met it.\nh) Sometimes I'll neglect important things for making a good impression that dates can't handle, the most notable one being that I was in between dental work on many dates and missing a front tooth (one specifically requested that I wait to reach out when I got that fixed and was clean shaven). However, I also sometimes don't optimize my clothes and hair/facial hair if I'm not locked in enough on date preparation.\ni) One had concern about ADD heritability.\nj) see comments on this website for more feedback on lack of interest.\n3)\nI have lots more speculative reasons for why I don't attract some women:\nlack of similar values such as agnostic, coming from a progressive family, intimidating, my focus on optimizing life at the expense of what others would consider enjoying it, my socially divergent tendencies,  don't seem funny or charismatic enough, anxiety/confidence/self-love/self-compassion issues or not knowing thoughtful date gestures to make a good impression (I have continued to optimize a lot of these), not in a good head space during dating because of stress, not good at meeting, identifying, and asking women out IRL, not perfect at flirting, not other's physical type, ideal partner archetype, not emotionally attune enough with dates, women dealing with their own insecurities, biases, and triggers.\nWhy would you be a good husband and father?\nI am an ambitious and accomplished individual with demonstrated success in my past and I have started to refocus on how to become a skilled husband and father. My parents, sister, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have strong stable marriages with only two out of eleven divorces and the two in second degree relatives. I read and think a lot about how to be a better partner (and find and choose the best one) and parent, with a recent emphasis on emotional intelligence and communication of which I admittedly had a huge opportunity for improvement but have and will continue to refine these skills. I've included some reviews from female friends that show some of my strengths. I also have a lot of value I can bring because of all the time and efforts I've spent investing in myself and the strong foundation I was granted by my upbringing and various genetic advantages.\nIf anyone has any tips on how to become a better husband and father or how to attract and find the best partner, please feel free to provide any guidance.\nAre you just looking for someone to have children with?\nWhile I want children and believe my partner's fertility/eggs are an incredibly valuable asset they bring to the relationship, I do understand how important it is to reassure women that this is not the only aspect that I value in partnership with them. I want to deliver the best experience for my life partner, myself, and the family unit, which I imagine will require loyalty, commitment, loving her unconditionally, building an equitable relationship, and investing/supporting her and the family in the ways she prefers. I want the relationship and family to be great and realize that will take continual communication, time, commitment, and energy investment. I expect it to be very challenging at times.\nWhat does your dating process look like?\nI prefer as much written material upfront to review as others are willing to provide. This would include your dating preferences for me to review and incorporate as well. I find an initial video and/or audio call prior to meeting useful since I usually have to do a good deal of travel for an in person date, but I am willing to consider skipping it if I have enough upfront information. I've learned to find a lot of useful information from profiles, messages, social media, and calls that correlate well to potential compatibility. I do tend to think unwillingness to be forthright with information and a call prior to meeting doesn't bode well for compatibility as it suggests things like insecurities, lack of intentionality, and unwillingness to invest effort, consideration, and generosity in to the dating process. ​\nI do love written material and social media to review, but don't frequently ask for it since some women do not seem particularly inclined to providing it and are sometimes taken aback by the request. I hugely appreciate when matches look at this website, let me know when they have reviewed it, and respond with information that's mentioned here (or make any effort to further share things about themselves that they feel are important), but again, I don't require or even suggest it as I feel they would have simply provided such if they were willing to do so upon having read this. I try to respond to all messages, but don't tend to initiate them often as I find audio, video, and in person more helpful.\nI like to pace dates to about once per week rather than moving immediately to heavy courtship, physical, and/or emotional intimacy as we continue to decide whether to intentionally advance. I am hesitant to be physically intimate or invest too much time quickly without adequate periods to reflect to avoid strong emotional connection prior to getting to know each other well and find that without reflection, I am prone to overexuberance. This slower pace has disappointed some women who are interested in starting with passion, intimacy, and moving quickly towards attachment and commitment, but I have found emotional entanglement without knowing each other well and the associated stress on the back end particularly unpleasant and time consuming as I find disappointing women who become attached traumatizing for the both of us. I regret that meeting on a dating app creates a higher expectation of immediate romance and courtship than I find helpful for those who know little about each other if we are trying to move strategically and intentionally to a life partnership. I am often overwhelmed by trying my best to impress and treat my dates well while ultimately being most interested in learning about them and do find it stressful when they start liking me before I feel comfortable that I know who they are and whether they would be a good partner.\nI do date in parallel and prefer those I'm dating to do the same as I find it stressful when those I am dating become fixated on me prior to myself feeling ready to do the same. I generally say I need a few months (three?) of dating prior to being comfortable being exclusive because I feel a lot of pressure from women in the past to do so quickly and have often agreed even though it's wasn't consistent with my own thoughts and feelings because I do tend to want to please those I'm dating and lose sight of my own wishes. I do try to communicate my thoughts and feelings as openly as possible to help pace dating and I get better at it the more I practice, but I still have moments of exuberance and excitement that I continue to try to temper because I worry about it creating too strong a connection resulting in the potential for disappointment of those I date. With that said, if you're wanting to know where I am at please feel free to ask, but be ready for the truth that is often not the fantasy that women seem to naturally develop and dream of.\nI am inclined to maintain friendship even if life partnership doesn't seem appropriate for either of us for those emotionally mature enough to do so. I have come across ~4 women whose continued contact has been too emotionally taxing to maintain, but it happens less as I've learned how to identify the early warning signs of such better with time to the point I now believe I will be able to avoid most of these people.\nI try to protect the heart of those I'm dating and I believe this intentionality, strategy, and restraint is helpful but I am open to communication and collaboration on everything. I request that you try your best to trust I am doing everything in my power to balance doing right by you and myself as anger, distrust, and criticism cuts me deeply, so any patience and compassion for my mistakes is greatly appreciated.\nAlso of note, I love to tackle important topics for compatibility and sustainability of the relationship as soon as those I'm dating are comfortable. The following is an example of a potential list:\nhttps://medium.com/@doctorbecky/45-things-to-ask-before-you-get-married-2cd2b61915a1\nwhich I tackle at the end of this webpage. Consider reading this summary of \"how not to die\" alone to help decide whether we are on the same page:\nhttps://ericsandroni.com/how-to-not-die-alone-summary/\n. I don't agree with all the points, but I think they are useful things to think about and appreciate when others are thinking about the same.\nI ballpark about two years of a relationship prior to my desire to starting to have kids, which I'd like to start as soon as my partner and I are comfortable.\nWhat were some reasons for the end of your past relationships?\nI certainly have weaknesses in relationships that I mention in sections further below and continue to try to improve upon them. This section simply describes who initiated the breakup and why.\n*The last two women I seriously dated are described above and we dated for about 3 months each.\n*ex-GF4 (6 months long): I can't talk about this one publicly per her request.\n*as I got to know ex-GF3 (6 months long) better, I felt her values, integrity, and emotional immaturity weren't what I wanted from my life partner and mother of my children.\n*ex-GF2 (1 year long) has also asked me not to talk about the relationship. She suggests \"\nWe are both learning how to be better, and I think people should have the opportunity to learn about you and make their own opinion. You can just say that we were not compatible if someone asks.\"\n*ex-GF1 (3 years long) was mentioned above in\nPast Relationship Positive Feedback\nand broke up with me. I believe I have worked on and changed many things that contributed to her decision, most notably that I didn't commit the time and energy to maintaining the relationship that a partner deserves because I didn't fully understand the importance of this concept and I was still much more concerned and invested in my occupational pursuits at that point. Ultimately she didn't feel loved and appreciated enough which I certainly regret, but believe I can better manage this now.\nWhy Start A War for the name of the website?\nIt's a song: ​\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y41xwsj7vIs\nEnding\nThanks for taking the time to read my profile and any help you provide. Private and public comments available on top right and bottom of this page respectively. Contact info link in top right. 💫\nI took out the dating blog/story section, so let me know and I can send it to you or consider bringing it back.\nEverything Below was Removed for Brevity:\nSurvey questions\nthat I'd find helpful in addition to the information provided in a standard online profile mentioned above:\n1. How willing and able (fertility planning and/or number of frozen eggs if over 33) would you be to have 3 more kids.\n2. What's your net worth and current and future earnings/cash flow expectations?\n3. What are your greatest accomplishments and skills?\n4. What are your future aspirations for your life and family?\n5. What athletic background do you have?\n6. What information do you believe is important for me or a prospective date to know.\nBonuses:\n7. Describe how your current dating and relationship aspirations are informed by your past dating and relationships. What are your most recent and significant relationships? What areas of relationships do you still struggle with and try to focus on? What would you describe as the cause of your recent breakups?\n8. Tell me about your family background.\n9. What are your thoughts on religion, politics, and finances in relationships.\n10. How do you like to fill your time and what are your interests?\n11. Who are the closest people in your life as far as family and friends?\nTag Line\nAre you looking for a man in finance, 6’3”, green eyes???\nSocial Media\nI like connecting with matches on LinkedIn to understand occupational and educational background. Occasionally, I find IG and Facebook useful when initially connecting because I don't feel the profile pictures that were chosen provide an adequate idea of what a person looks like. Once I decide I'm interested in investing time in a match and getting to know them I like being connected on social media because I find it helpful to stay in touch and I'm invested and curious about others successes and like to provide support. I often am hesitant to ask to connect because many women are careful with their privacy and anonymity, but please don't hesitate to let me know if you are alright with letting me see or connect with your social media as I'm generally interested in doing so when I'm building a connection.\nPickleball\nPickleball is my go to activity for networking and dating. It requires little coordination to enjoy and is an incredible networking tool through open play, which I feel all single people should be aware of. It's a viral cultural phenomenon, so it's incredibly timely and I just so happen to be a great tour guide and coach because of my background in coaching, education, and passion for it. Many women are nervous about trying, but not one has ever regretted it that I know of.\n​\nOpposite Sex Platonic Relationships:\nSome women prefer I don't maintain contact with ex-GF1 and other women who I've developed friendships with and sometimes dated, which I've always complied with when requested. But I'll admit, I don't think it's necessary nor do I require the same from my partner with their male friends and exes. I'm good at maintaining clear boundaries and have never cheated emotionally or physically on any partner (nor do I plan to) and don't require such boundaries for my partner as I'm inherently trusting of others to manage these things themselves as they best see fit.\nWhy don't you hire a matchmaker?\nI have looked in to it and am open to any and all suggestions, however I do question whether they would connect me with anyone better than who is available in the online community. One match suggested that they search LinkedIn and their pool might include people who don't join the apps. I talked to one matchmaker who starts at 50k and explained that it basically is head hunting for matches (and I'll note that I've heard many criticisms of head hunters as well). She suggested I should be focusing on dating rather than the search. Do you think an ideal match would be more responsive to someone else doing the search than me doing it on my own on the apps? I figured I'd do a better job, given all my experience and effort and it would be more practical for someone who doesn't have the system and time to execute. I haven't heard of any users of them that speak highly of them and read and meet many negative reviews of them. They also heavily target my demographic and many of the referrals I've received have been associated with referral bonuses if I sign. Some sources have suggested that many of the best match makers don't do it as a profession, but as their own passion. Overall, I think they make the most sense for those with plenty of money they are happy to spend and without the time and interest in navigating the dating world by themselves.\nWhy do I want 3 or more children?\nI think raising children will be very personally rewarding despite and because of all the work it will entail, even given the investments I plan to make in the difficult tasks of child rearing. Building strong and solid relationships with people, through family, friendship, mentorship, etc is very rewarding and so I'd like to pursue it especially with one of the deepest bonds that all of us have between child and parent. Although we leave legacies to the world with many things we do, one way is through the family and children with which we raise. Although, I'm proud of the influence I've had in this world (and hope to contribute more), I believe I can have even more with the children and family of which I'm a part. I think my partner and I will have and raise great children with the help of our families and communities. Ultimately, it is a combination of personal reward, meaning, and further contribution I hope to make.\n​\nWhat are my areas for improvement in relationships?\nI spend lots of time and energy on emotional intelligence, attachment, and communication for the benefit of myself and my future partner (although I find the skills useful in business, friendship, and other relationships). A Facebook friend, former medical school classmate, and life coach suggested I may have some avoidant dismissive tendencies despite my first GF adamantly reporting a secure attachment in our first relationship. Remember though that attachment styles change with time and changes in situations. However, that relationship had several important areas for improvement, including that she prioritized my needs and wants at the expense of her own, which did lead to resentment on her part and we had some codependency and opportunities for growth in improving our communication and emotional intelligence (particularly myself. It was my first relationship though!). Below are some aspects that I have worked on improving including better identifying and managing my own emotional states and those of others which I believe I have improved on enormously.\n•In an intimate relationship, I sometimes feel suffocated by demands, especially if my partner asks me how I am feeling. I have difficulty identifying and describing some of my emotion\ns\nand sometimes other people realize them before I do.\n•I sometimes prioritized my interests, career, and hobbies over my relationships.\n•I am happy to meet the practical needs of my loved ones, but I sometimes get uncomfortable and have difficulty when these same people need emotional support.\n•I am okay with asking others to meet my wants (i.e. friendships, sex life, physical intimacy), but not my needs (practical, financial, survival).\n•When my feelings are hurt, I sometimes retreat and process instead of reaching out and talking it through with whoever hurt me.\n•I sometimes have difficulty figuring out how to get close emotionally in dating and relationships.\n•I like constant and predictable environments under my control because it helps me self-regulate (in addition to exercise which is one of my main self-regulation tools).\n•I sometimes have difficulty opening up and being vulnerable.\n•Keystone Limiting Belief: I am unsafe\n•Other Limiting Beliefs: I am trapped, I am helpless, I am weak if vulnerable, I am powerless, “Why bother” belief, I am defective\n•Triggers:\n•Criticism/Shame\n•Conflict\n•Loss of independence/freedom\n•Commitments (e.g.: Both big romantic commitments as well as just overcommitting time, space, energy, etc.)\nAvoidant Attachment Nervous System Response\n•Stress Response: Predominantly Flight and/or Freeze Response\n•Setting very large and strong boundaries\n•Avoiding Conflict\n•Ignoring/dismissing\n•Frustration/irritation/impatience\n•Chronic low level anxiety\n•Stonewalling/Withdrawing/Distance\n•Disconnection/dissociation\n•Emotional Suppression/Numbing\n•Avoiding Vulnerability\n•Flaw findings of partners/deactivation\nI've done a lot of learning and reflecting to identify and address these tendencies when they rear their head. GF1 thinks my ADD explains the greatest difficulties she experienced in being a relationship with me, as possibly did GF2 and GF4. These things didn't seem to bother the last couple women I dated, which I believe is the result of greater self-awareness and improved communication I've developed.\nWhy include your net worth? Don't you think you'll attract the wrong people?\nI definitely think it will attract some of the wrong people and scare away some of the right people. However, ultimately these are things I find many women including many of my female friends want to know and for very good reasons. Most of them aren't given the information, but try to look for indications of competence and financial and social status. I'd rather just make it easy for women to figure out since some like to know and have continued to improve in my ability to screen the wrong women out as many other successful men and women learn to do. I also prefer to know the financial situation of women I date and so I see this as simply treating others as I myself prefer to be treated and\nopening up the channel for discussion that women might otherwise feel less inclined to approach without my precedent.\nWhat is the typical response to this website and approach?\nI'm not sure there is one, but the \"comments\" section on this site can give you a flavor.\nWhy didn't you reply?\n​I presume others prefer no response if I haven't been presented enough information to suspect I'd be interested romantically to avoid the sting that is often felt with perceived rejection, so if you do prefer confirmation or explanation of lack of interest, please let me know. I certainly am thankful for everyone's attention and interest and do often worry about the way with which people prefer to be communicated. I for my part love to know when people aren't interested and continue to train myself to redirect the emotional trigger of perceived rejection gracefully and appreciatively outwardly while continuing to experience the emotions inwardly.\nMy Tips:\nDating is not easy for many of us, but I believe the more we invest in improving our skills and abilities (such as emotional intelligence and communication) required for the process, the more likely we are to achieve any goals we have for our life in the realm and the skills are very useful for other areas of your life as well. What holds some people back is how difficult and discouraging the process can be (myself included), so consider finding collaborators, coaches, and mentors\nto keep you motivated\nin the process if your relationship goals are important to you. Resources that I've found helpful in improving myself have been using coaches, friends (but be careful trusting general opinions), mentoring others, writing/sharing who I am and what I'm looking for (and having people challenge me), following dating/relationship/life coaches on Reels so my short form media targets that content, and putting lots of time and energy in to personal improvement, dating, and relationship skills. It has been paying incredible dividends in my search and all aspects of my life. Good luck\n🍀 to everyone and let me know if can help and if you have discovered any pearls yourself.\n​\nThank You for Everyone's Help\nThank you to those who have and continue to help in my quest for building my network of incredible women and finding a life partner with referrals, sharing this website, providing advice, revisions, and more.\nMarriage Counseling Add-On Section\nI answered some of the marriage counseling questions from\nhttps://medium.com/@doctorbecky/45-things-to-ask-before-you-get-married-2cd2b61915a1\n:\nDo you keep your bank account in the black? Yes. What’s your attitude about debt? Fine. I have it on the house with a like 2.?? Interest. Are you okay if your partner wants to handle their money completely differently? I think so. It is hers. I have been in a position to give advice when desired, which has been the case for two girlfriends. Will you be transparent in allowing your spouse to know your finances and will they be transparent with you? I will and hope they will too. Will you combine money or keep separate accounts, each contributing to the household? I’m probably more inclined to keep separate accounts and suspect I will be the primary contributor of household expenses because of my wealth as that seems to have been the case in all my past relationships as there has always been a fairly large wealth disparity. I do plan on using a prenuptial agreement..\nSex. What are your sexual preferences? Are you mostly vanilla or do you like a lot of sprinkles and syrups? Fairly vanilla, but happy to accommodate to the preferences of my partner. What type of sexual relationship do you envision as ideal? Communication about our sexual desires, preferences, and frequency with willingness to collaborate to optimize for both of us. Do you have the maturity to be okay on those days, weeks or months your spouse doesn’t feel like it? Yeah. Easy for me. I have handled it myself most of my life. Can you be flexible over the lifespan as sexual interest ebbs and flows? Absolutely. Would you seek medical treatment and potentially take medications or undergo procedures if something physical came up that affect being sexual? Sure. No problem.\nBio family. If you marry, would your partner put you first, over their extended family members? Absolutely. Does their family practice appropriate boundaries and mind their own business? I think so. Would they be supportive of your relationship? Yes. What are your biological family’s expectations of you as a couple? We make our own rules and they would prefer to stay out of most of it. Are you willing to set firm boundaries with them if necessary? Sure.\nCareer. Will one or both of you have a career? Have you discussed career goals? I want to work to expand. Will you stay in balance with your work, avoiding workaholism? I’ll try my best. I may need my partner's help setting boundaries, however I've deprioritized most work until I find a partner, so dating, relationships, etc is where most of my time and energy go. Do you believe one person’s career is more important than the other? No. If one of you wants to quit work, to raise kids, go to school, take a break, would you be willing to support them? I think so. If you have children and must take them to the doctor, who will leave work to do so? I currently don’t have work, but figured we might have nannies as well. Who will take the day off to nurse a sick child? Flexible schedule now, so I can probably do it most of the time.\nWork ethic. If your family requires a two-person income to live a solid middle class lifestyle, are you willing to pull your weight to make it happen? Sure, but probably not needed. If either one of you lose your job, will you find something, anything, to help until you can find something new? Again, probably a non-issue.\nTidiness. Is one of you obsessive about cleanliness and everything having a place? Not me. Will you be able to lovingly live with a partner who is not that way? Would you inflict your tidy and cleanliness needs on them? If you are messy, are you willing to be more mindful of how that affects others? I have a tendency to messiness and disorganization and happy to get maids and do my best to contain myself.\nHolidays. Some people have strong family traditions. Would you be willing to spend every major holiday with either you or your partner’s family? I think I’m flexible. Only one partner through the holidays and she would spend it with mine most of the time, but I do whatever my partner tells me. Would you be willing to take turns, or would you prefer to have your own holiday, just the two of you? I’m fine with whatever, although I’ve never done an own holiday with a partner. What kind of birthday, holiday traditions are important to you? Thanksgiving and Christmas I typically do with my family. Are there any holiday or birthday traditions you reject? I don’t think so, although I don't usually celebrate birthdays or holidays on my own accord.\nSpiritual practice. Religious beliefs are highly personal. Does either one of you have a strong spiritual or religious stance? I am non-spiritual and agnostic and prefer to avoid religion or any investment in the metaphysical. Is it important for your spouse to practice the way you do? I have never been in a relationship with someone especially religious but I’d be open to it. Would you want to raise children in your religion? I’d defer to my wife’s wishes on this, but prefer to have to participate as little as possible. Is it okay with you if you practice religion or spirituality while your spouse does not? I’d prefer I’m not made to, but have accommodated girlfriends for special occasions like visiting one of their grandmothers and such.\nPets. Does one of you have, or want to have, pets? Anyone allergic to pets? Myself and my parents are allergic to cats and siblings and parents have always had dogs. I've never bothered with having a pet, but helped my one girlfriend who did have one. Are you both okay with having indoor pets? That’s fine. Would you let your pet sleep in your bed? I think so, as long as it doesn’t disturb my sleep too much. Do you believe in responsible pet ownership that includes medical care and not surrendering your animal for any reason? I believe in responsible medical care. I'm not sure what is meant by not surrendering your animal. My mother typically euthanized our dogs when practical to do so because of underlying illness if that's what is meant and got rid of her dog when I was born as it seemed to be unsafe around me. My mom was also very upset at my step grandmother whose dog bit my sister's face and blamed my sister for it. If you have pets, who will feed and take care of them? I’ll try to help like I did with my second girlfriend.\nPolitics. The nation has become viciously divided, and so have many couples and families who have different views on political issues. Do you have similar or opposing beliefs? I come from a progressive/liberal/democratic family and I'm the least political in my family by far. Do you require a potential partner to have the same political beliefs as you? No. Can you be fine with a partner who dislikes almost everything you believe in? I haven’t had to deal with that before, but my first girlfriends dad was a chiropractor and so she believed heavily on a pseudoscience called muscle testing and organized her food and water consumption in a very regimented fashion around it. She also had some views that considered anti-scientific such as vaccine skepticism. I would prefer partners who don't hold these anti-scientific beliefs, but I can deal with them as demonstrated in that past relationship. Definitely like to know the deal upfront though.\nSports. Does one of you like to watch or play sports anytime you can, including golf, football, tennis, soccer, hunting, fishing, etc. I do love to workout and/or play sports everyday. Do you believe you are balanced in your love of participating in or watching sports? I have become imbalanced in the past but think I have learned to become more balanced in relationships with time. If you are obsessed with watching or participating in sports, is your partner okay with that? Are you willing to compromise? I believe I am pretty good at compromising now.\nFirearms. What are your beliefs about firearms? Don’t think they are necessary. Would you have firearms in your home? Prefer not to, but my first girlfriend got a gun for her personal protection. Would they be loaded? I think hers was loaded. What safety precautions would you take? I think she left on the safety. Hopefully it’s locked if we had kids.\nMusic. Do you share similar taste in music? Would you insist on playing your music even if your spouse abhors it? What kind of music drives you crazy? Can you find music that both of you enjoy? Hasn’t been an issue yet. I don’t love some of my mom’s music and I deal with it.\nHealth. Do you believe in taking care of yourself? Yes. Do you do it? Yes. Do you get regular health maintenance like checkups, dentist visits, vaccinations? Most of the time. Do you care if your spouse does? I prefer she did. Do you think exercise and weight management is important? Yes. If you experience health problems would you do all you can to resolve them? Yes.\nAlcohol. Do you drink? Not really. If you do, do you do it in balance? Do you care if your partner drinks? No. If drinking becomes a problem in your life, would you get help? Yes, but I have never had issues with addiction.\nBirth Control. Do you believe both partners are responsible for birth control? Yes. As a spouse, would you be willing to use birth control? Yes. If you decide to not have any more children, would either of you be willing to take permanent measures to end fertility? Yes.\nBoundaries with exes. Do you believe it is okay to remain friends with ex and sometimes do things together? I have remained friendly with two ex-gfs, but we never do anything other than text or chat occasionally. I feel like I’m good with boundaries and trust worthy if I did do anything with them. Trust my partner to make the right decision for themself.\nCrazy exes. Crazy vindictive exes exist and can bring down a relationship that otherwise would have flourished. If your potential partner is constantly going back to court to battle and their former love enjoys making life miserable for them, you might think twice before signing up. I have one crazy ex-gf. We rarely communicate anymore.\nSaving. Do you believe in setting a certain amount of money aside for retirement? Yes Do you have a plan for that? Yes. Are you okay if you want to save and your spouse does not? I’d prefer a spouse that likes to save as well.\nWorry, anxiety and mental health. One of the biggest shocks I’ve experienced as a therapist is seeing how nervous, fearful, anxious, phobic, or paranoid so many people are. The constant obsessive thinking drains energy, breaks down health, and relationships. These things are highly fixable with trauma therapy and sometimes, medications. If you have this issue, would you be willing to do everything in your power to overcome it? Yes, I’ve had to overcome this thing before during acute stressors and developed many tools including medication.\nPersonality. One of the few things in life that can’t be changed. If you don’t like characteristics of your partner’s personality, decide if they are deal breakers. I am extroverted and a walking exclamation mark, my husband is introverted and loves quiet, and it works, mainly because he is incredibly accepting and tolerant. Can you be tolerant of your partner’s personality differences, or do you want them to be like you, or different than they are? Can you accept them as is, without hope for change? I’ve had partners that have difficulty accepting my ADD and some with difficulty with my obsessive compulsive personality traits around saving and frugality, but I’ve also learned how to become more flexible and communicate better with time.\nGrowth and evolution. The world is full of seekers and non-seekers. Which one are you? Some people are endlessly curious and love learning, growing, and being better. This is me. Others are fine with how they are. I have had numerous conversations with distraught spouses married to people who care nothing about evolving. Would this be important to you? I love evolving and I don’t think I’ve dated anyone who does like the same.\nEating out. Some people want to eat out almost every meal, and sometimes this means fast food. Is that okay with you? I rarely eat out, but would be open to it. What kind of meal traditions are important to you? None. Do you care about healthy nutrition? Healthy diet is important to me. Is it okay with you if your spouse does not? I’d prefer a spouse that cares about health. Never dated anyone who doesn’t care. Probably wouldn’t\nFood. What kinds of foods would you want to keep around the house? Who will be responsible for grocery shopping and cooking? You probably wouldn’t want to eat most of the food I make, but you’re certainly welcome to. Not a fan of grocery shopping for others, but I’ll do it.\nTV habits. In the age of streaming, enticing television is always available, and it can become addicting. Do you love to spend most free time, in the evening after work, watching TV? I try to avoid TV. Do you think television is a waste of time and should be minimized? Yes, I think TV is a waste of time and should be minimized. Would you like a TV-free household? I just don’t like a TV on frequently because I find it very distracting. If you do enjoy watching TV together, does that count as quality time? Yeah, that counts. Are you comfortable with your partner watching TV and knitting, painting, or playing on their phone or tablet? Preferably with ear buds, because as previously mentioned, I find it distracting.\nPhones, tablets, video games. Is your partner in love with their electronic devices? I spend a lot of time on my computer and phone, but try to respect people by putting it away when quality time is being had. Are you comfortable with the amount of time they spend on these plug-in time consumers? It’s not fair to get married to someone who has a phone glued to their hand and ask them to put it down so you can be comfortable. Work it out prior to marriage. I’ll probably need to learn when it needs to be put away.\nRetirement plans. A lot of people I know did not plan for the future and regret it today. If you want to have an adult marriage, you will both want to dedicate yourselves to putting back enough for your senior years. Don’t count on working until you die or inheriting a chunk from Grandmother. Live your lives as if your financial future depends on you, because often, it will.\nEmotional maturity. This is a biggie. One of the most common characteristics of emotional immaturity is blaming other people for your unhappiness. Short of things like getting punched in the nose unprovoked, blaming others for your plight in life is highly inappropriate. You are responsible for you and your happiness. People who are mature control and edit themselves and accept responsibility for how they feel. Adults are willing to delay gratification for a higher reward. They are respectful and conduct themselves in a way that’s conducive to getting along with people. They are solid and grounded. For me, this is a requirement to sign up for a lifetime with someone.\nAttachment style. It’s important to know your and your partner’s attachment styles, and to decide whether you are comfortable with them. If not, you have the option to work for change, but it’s a tough journey. Here’s what they are: 1. Avoidant — Keeps people at arm’s length. Often emotionally unavailable. Too much closeness and they pull away while complaining of feeling smothered. 2. Anxious. Anxiety-filled and desperately seek closeness. May feel insecure and need regular reassurance and contact. When paired with an avoidant, they play a game of trying to pull their love closer, only to find they stay for a moment, and pull away. 3. Secure attached. The healthiest attachment style, the secure attached person can give their partner all the space they need or come close, whatever is called for. 4. Disorganized. Unpredictable and volatile in relationships, experience feelings of both avoidant and anxious attachment. If it was me, I would always choose a secure attached partner. I have some secure and some avoidant tendencies.\nTemperament. Oh, the misery a moody person brings to another. A bad mood can ruin precious moments, and the sad thing is, it’s controllable. Are you and your partner capable of controlling your moods? If not, would you go to a physician and therapist to sort it out? It is each person’s responsibility to bring their best self to the marriage. Most partners would probably describe me as stable, although I have had some instability in times of significant career stress.\nSleep and energy levels. I was raised in a family where sleep was a precious thing, and it was always to be respected. If someone was tired, let them sleep. Other families are more regimented and perceive that sleeping late in the morning and taking naps is a sign of laziness and time-wasting. I personally disagree with this. What are your views on sleeping? Can you get up at the break of dawn and allow your spouse to sleep if they need with no negative repercussions? The healthy stance is to let people be who they are, practice self-care as they need, and to not control or judge them. When it comes to having enough energy to make it through a day, good sleep hygiene, nutrition, being mentally and emotionally healthy are all part of what creates it. Are you willing to arrange your life so that you have as much energy as you need to work and participate in family relationships? I’m a night owl and can get on weird sleep routines.\nExpectations. Many of my clients expect certain things and raise hell when disappointed. It is not appropriate for any adult to have expectations of another without the other person’s agreement. It’s important for a couple to negotiate expectations in the marriage. You will find many subjects to address as far as that goes right here on this list. Go over it, and mutually agree on what you can. You may not get everything you desire, and if you don’t, you must take care yourself as you would a child who is let down.\nLoyalty. Potentially more important than anything else on this list, do you have one another’s back? If someone speaks ill of your love, will you correct them? Will you protect them from your family if your family steps on toes? Will you drop what you’re doing to be there for them if something major befalls? This is one of the biggest bond builders, and knowing your love is solidly in your corner come what may is one of the best feelings there is. Make sure your partner has it. I think I’m good on this in relationships and have some ex-es that can vouch for this.\nFriendship. Would you still want to know and be close friends with your partner if they were a different gender? If your attraction is mainly physical, you’re putting your eggs in the wrong basket. It is friendship and the enjoyment of each other’s company that will carry you through to the finish line. All we need is a fondness that feels comfortable, warm, and fuzzy, that no one else but your partner can provide.\nPower differentials. Age, beauty, money, education, culture, religion, social background … all these dynamics have power. Marriage therapists know that the wider apart a couple is in power differentials, the more likely the relationship will falter. For example, you are young, they are old; you come from money, they’ve always been poor. You are beautiful, them not so much. He has a doctorate; you have a GED. You are Asian, they are African American. Any sort of discrepancies, differences in each person, will weigh against the relationship over the long term. Not always or in every case, but it should be considered.\nWork of marriage. Most people have heard that marriage is work, but they don’t know what that means. It means time, thoughtfulness, self-control, and sacrifice. The book The Five Love Languages (2) is the best book to explain what this means. Physical touch, words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, and gifts. Find out your partner’s love languages and practice them daily. Yes, I said daily. I struggled with this in my first couple relationships. Because of my ADD and OCPD I can get hyperfixated and neglectful, but I respond well to to feedback from my partner and have learned to communicate this.\nSensibilities. Some people are picky and bothered by a lot of things, and others are extremely tolerant of people and their environment. Which do you think is easiest to live with? I think I’m quite tolerant.\nSocial media. I can’t tell you how many clients complain about their spouse being addicted to their phone, tablet, and social media. And the video games! The question is, how much does your partner do it, and are they able to set these things aside and be there when you need them? If it’s a problem now, I’d take whether they are the person for you under serious consideration.\nDebt. My husband teasingly causes Amazon deliveries bankruptcy boxes. That’s funny, but credit cards and financial infidelity are a tremendous issue in marriages, and whether you plan to share cards or have one of your own, will you be transparent with how much unsecured debt you carry? Some spouses want zero credit card debt, would you be on board with that? What’s your philosophy of spending now, paying later? I try to always pay of my balance. I couldn’t handle a spouse who didn’t have decent saving and personal finance capabilities.\nVacations. Yes, some couples argue about vacations. Whether to take them, when to take them, how frugal, how fancy? Beach? Snow? The Grand Canyon? Burning Man? Others are homebodies and would prefer never to travel at all. Does your partner have any fears or phobias that prevent them from wanting to travel? What are your ideas and dreams about how family vacation time should be spent? I’m a home body and not in to fancy things, but I am happy to accommodate my partners wishes as well and find a balance. I’m also open to my partner traveling without me as they desire.\nVax or no vax? This may have to do with politics, but I have seen a couple who separated because one spouse wouldn’t wear a mask or get vaccinated during the pandemic, and the wife found it so disrespectful that she kicked her husband out. How would you handle such a situation? If you are against vaccinations, can you accept your spouse having a different opinion? Can you respect your partner’s decisions when they are different from yours? I have trouble with people that are in to conspiracy theories and anti-science. With that said, I almost married one and I found ways to deal with it. But I would love to find someone with normal critical reasoning and appropriate trust in science.\nFighting style. Criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling are predictors of divorce. In marriages that happily last the long term, the couples tend to laugh things off. Most couples I see are in the first category. I teach couples daily how to settle arguments calmly and respectfully, and how to get to the point where they can laugh things off. It’s a learned skill and you must pay a trauma therapist to teach you how. Knowing what I know, I would insist on that. I think I am pretty good at this stuff.\nBoundaries. Adults have free will to live as they choose, and no one has the right to control them. That’s why I want you to understand that your marriage partner comes, as is. Marriage will involve negotiation, compromise, and sometimes sacrifice. If you have met someone who is controlling and have to have things a certain way, then you need to think long and hard about how that’s going to feel day after day, year after year. We all have the right to make reasonable and respectful requests of our spouses, but they have the right to say no. Also, boundaries include restraining and editing yourself, with friends and family. Is your partner good at that? Do they hold things inside and resent? If so, think again, my friend. I work a lot on my emotional intelligence, regulation, and conflict resolution skills. Also, have addressed some of my OCPD that’s not ideal for relationships. I think I’m in a pretty good spot.\n60 Comments\nAuthor\nDillon Paul\nFeedback (optionally anonymous)\nName\n*\nFirst\nLast\nEmail\n*\n*\nIndicates required field\nComment\n*\nSubmit\nArchives\nJune 2024\nCategories\nAll\nRSS Feed\nPowered by\nCreate your own unique website with customizable templates.\nGet Started"

      "fullText": "﻿Last updated 20th October 2025\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, I’m Jack!\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am a single, straight 32-year-old man in Washington DC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking to find a woman for the long-term. Someone who is kind, intelligent, fun, open-minded, health-conscious, and interested in making the world better. Also in or close to DC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document has some more thoughts about me and what I’m looking for. If it seems like you might be interested, even if it’s not all a perfect match then do reach out (jack.malde@gmail.com, or on my social media) with some information about you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit more about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve always found it a bit tricky to write about myself, but here we go:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I grew up in London and moved to DC about 2.5 years ago to take a job at a think tank. I’m planning to stay in DC but will go back to London at least once a year to see my family. I’ve got some family scattered around the US too which is nice!\r\n* I’m a triple US/UK/Netherlands citizen (I know - a nice combo to have).\r\n* I’m a bit of a nerd at heart. I like reading about or listening to podcasts on philosophy, economics or science. I’m interested in meditation (but not great at doing it regularly…). I’m vegan for ethical reasons (well like 95% - I have my weak moments where I might nab a cookie if it’s right there). I even play a bit of online chess.\r\n* But on a less nerdy note I enjoy running and have run two marathons. I like music gigs/festivals and theatre (I’m into most genres but especially indie rock e.g. The National, BCNR). I like travelling and want to see more of the US. OK maybe some of those things are slightly nerdy too…\r\n* I’m working in economic policy but am still figuring out the best career path for me. I know I want to do a lot of good through my work, and am deeply interested in Effective Altruism and how we can think rationally about how to do the most good. I even write my own thoughts on the EA Forum.\r\n* Even though I feel like a zombie, I still insist on getting out of bed early. At the moment I’m trying 5:30am wake ups, although it’s often later on weekends. I just like getting on with the day, often starting with meditating or a morning run.\r\n* I am planning on having children, but will only do this if I genuinely believe that my partner and I will make a great parenting team and do a terrific job. I also can’t see myself raising children who eat meat.\r\n* I’m generally pretty happy, calm, kind, intelligent, organized. I can be funny, if you share my sense of humor, which can be a bit silly. I’m not easily offended.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for someone to share my life with. Someone to have fun with, to confide in and grow with. I’d like any relationship to be pretty balanced without one person being very reliant on the other person. I’m looking for someone for the long-term - I’d quite happily quit dating apps for good!\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t need someone exactly like me, but it would be nice if there are a few similarities based on what I mentioned in the previous section. This isn’t essential though, maybe we’d just get on really well with each other without being similar! I do think intelligence and kindness are hugely important in a partner though, and I would feel uncomfortable raising children who ate meat (mentioning in case that’s a deal breaker).\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical attractiveness is important to me. I like someone who frequently smiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nI lean towards being a bit introverted. I enjoy the quiet nights quite a bit, whether it be board games, movies, TV or chatting. I do like to go to parties, but I’m trying to drink less these days. So I’m not looking for a party animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a few likely dealbreakers. If you think veganism is stupid we probably won’t work. If you think veganism is admirable, then that’s great, even if you aren’t vegan yourself! I can’t see myself doing a long-distance relationship, so am only interested in those in DC, or close to DC. Other probable requirements include someone who doesn’t smoke cigarettes and someone who isn’t religious.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly though, I’m not 100% sure. I’ve never had a long-term relationship before and I’m not certain what type of person I would get on best with in a romantic sense. If you’ve made it this far and still feel positive about reaching out, please do so!\r\n\r\n\r\nMore photos of me"

My favorite hobby is tai chi push hands. It’s like a combination of jedi training, sumo wrestling, and ballroom dancing. Although I’ve competed in tournaments, one of my friends describes my push hands as “utterly without malice, full of love and healing.” I’m more interested in the soft, internal, and collaborative aspects these days. I practice taijiquan for health, self-defense, and because I love the playful movement and game of it.\r\nMovies/TV: I like smart or clever movies, fantasy, action, romance, and k/j/c-dramas - it’s more fun if I can learn a new language too. I also like watching something interesting together and then talking about it.\r\nOther Interests: Science, futurism, politics, public policy, interesting projects, painting, poetry, music, singing, dancing, mountains, water, relationships, psychology, Spiral Dynamics, psychic energy, geopolitics, economic trends, horticulture, enlightenment, travel, public health, languages, space, personal development, technology, cooking, and international relations.\r\nWriting/reading: I like to journal and read. I was a voracious reader as a child, and still read many books per year, but not as many as before. I usually read several articles per day on various topics (see other interests above). I would love to read books together and talk about them. I’ve written a book and plan to write more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship and Attachment Styles: \r\n\r\n\r\n* I have a generally positive outlook and a secure attachment style, which I have cultivated over time.\r\n* I would love to enter a long-term partnership with someone who is as interested in ongoing learning, personal growth, and relationship development.\r\n* I have experienced healthy ENM and relationships, and long-term monogamous ones. I could go in either direction. Whatever style we choose, I will honor it.\r\nOther quirks and random facts:\r\n* I like round geometric patterns, quiet spaces, and find moss soothing. \r\n* I was a featured artist at a poetry festival and part of an arts collective. \r\n* I’ve visited over 36 active volcanoes. \r\n* I pet a cheetah once. It rumbled like a lawnmower when it purred.\r\n* I’ve travelled solo in Asia, Central and South America, and Africa – but I much prefer travelling with people.  \r\n* I like to sing but am a bit shy about it.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWith some of my extended family, 10 years ago. (I’m 3rd from the right.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality Tests\r\n* Meyers-Briggs: INFP (More rarely, INTP.)\r\n* Enneagram 9 w 8: I find the internet’s description of 9s generally unsatisfying. But these quotes from Personality Types by Riso and Hudson describe where I am on the developmental scale of type 9 (on good days): \r\n   * “...healthy people of this subtype give the impression of strength and good nature, sensuality, and power.” p371\r\n   * “...very healthy Nines are an example to all the personality types of what it means to be at one with the self and at one with the world. They are an example of the profound unity which is possible for human beings – the unity of the self as well as the unity of the self and the other. They teach us of a self-possession and self-surrender so profound as to have mystical overtones. They are so effortlessly themselves and so completely receptive that very healthy Nines must reflect what human beings were like before the Fall into self-consciousness and alienation. They are a living reminder that, when all is said and done, we are each a gift to the other, just as the other is a gift to us. To be completely ourselves and yet fully related to the other is a mystery to be surrendered to in silence.” p 348. \r\n* Map of Human Consciousness: I’m interested in a partner who spends more time on the upper half of this diagram of David R. Hawkins's Map of Human Consciousness. We can resonate with different areas of this map from time to time, or under different circumstances. I’m actively in and striving for the upper reaches.   \r\nI’m pretty far down the rabbit hole in my exploration of non-dual consciousness and enlightenment. It’s not all roses (or lotuses) by any stretch of the imagination, but there’s a fundamental brilliance, ecstasy, joy, and love that bleeds through into everything in my world - even the hard stuff.\r\nDevelopmental Stage: somewhere between Transcendent Consciousness and Unity Consciousness. Jenny Wade wrote one of my favorite books, Changes of Mind, a Holonomic Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness. \r\n   * In her phrasing, I spend a lot of time in Unity Consciousness. This is a stage of experiencing self as One with all things manifest and unmanifest, accessing multiple dimensions of spiritual and psychic phenomena everyday concurrent with material “reality.”\r\n   * I also operate within the stage below it, Transcendent Consciousness, a stage of dissolution of ego, and increasing identification with all that is. Global range, holistic thinking, morphogenetic fields, and solving problems with a combination of data and intuition.\r\n   * In Suzanne Cook-Greuter's stages of ego development, I occupy Unitive Stage 6. You can read about it on pages 86 - 90 of her article here.\r\n   * Spiral Dynamics: Yellow, Turquoise, Coral (?) - see charts below for a summary of my world views. While I understand all the First Tier vMemes, and enjoy Yellow, I particularly love spending time with others who operate in the Turquoise to Coral ranges.  \r\nSource: http://www.calresco.org/wp/spiral.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chart below has only Yellow and Turquoise. Coral is not depicted on this chart. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSource and full chart here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/kentbye/288326085/in/photostream/ \r\nIf you want to do a deeper dive into these topics (which I find super interesting) you can read a more in-depth overview of Yellow’s nested hierarchies of complexity and systems thinking.\r\nAnd you can find out more about Turquoise’s holographic integration of life and self, technology and feelings, science and spirit.\r\nAs for Coral/Indigo, I couldn’t find an in-depth written description that I liked online, but here is a video with a great overview. \r\nThese are the spaces where I most often live.\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy Spiritual World – flowing between duality and non-duality (Oneness)\r\nAnd here’s the spiritual part of what I’m up to. It’s a huge part of my life path, so it gets its own section. I don’t need you to have a religion at all, and I won’t pressure you to be where I am with it, but I do need you to respect that I experience the world as a mystic, and it would be neat if you enjoy listening to me talk about it..\r\n      * I am very psychic (clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient, precognitive). \r\n      * I perceive the Light and Love that exists within all things. \r\n      * Sometimes I play with the light of the world, dancing with the flow of events in the downward current of manifestation at the intersection of dreams and reality. \r\n      * Within this flow, I often perceive things before they happen, and can sometimes shape the way they unfold.\r\n      * Right now there’s always a constant awareness of that infinite light, but I go back and forth between experiencing myself as utterly one with it, nothing of my personality there, and then back to experiencing myself as Serena-who-is-one-with-everything. So, still somewhat separate from it, or existing as a smaller self within that greater Self. But more and more, that distinction between self and Self is disappearing, or seems unimportant. Occasionally I experience that there is no difference.\r\n      * My awareness spans multiple dimensions, space-time, other worlds. I can perceive and communicate with entities in these spaces across a large range of energy frequencies. \r\n      * Minor miracles and uncanny coincidences are frequent events in my world. The improbable is probable in my life. \r\n      * I do energy healing work with friends and clients, mainly around energy psychology, spiritual development, trauma recovery, personal growth, clearing or upgrading energy anatomy, soul retrieval, past lives, future paths, and getting unstuck. \r\n      * I also attend to large scale things like clearing the traumatic residue of war, collaborating with friends to avert planetary destruction, helping to anchor divine light to aid large groups of people in leveling-up their state of consciousness and accelerate their spiritual awakening, or helping souls cross over after mass deaths.\r\n      * I also help staff a largish annual ceremony that sustains attendees’ annual personal development goals with an energy community in the Bay Area of California. A colleague and I are responsible for dreaming in the energies needed for the ceremony and helping to ground those energies into reality to help “juice” participants' future life changes. My intention is to support the personal awakening and growth of as many people as possible, so that we may change the world for the better. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are my flaws? Well, it depends on how you think of them, and I am generally kind to myself about them, but I can see how one or more of these would be deal breakers for some.\r\n      * Chronic health conditions: I have a well-managed autoimmune disorder (currently in full remission, expected lifespan = normal). Perimenopause is a challenge at the moment (insomnia, migraines), but HRT is helping. My current physical pace is slow and steady, except for having fast reflexes. If you want a partner to go running with you, I’m sorry, that is not me. We could go for walks though. I would love to walk and talk in beautiful places. I like gentle kayaking too. We could also do weight training, or tai chi. I’m open to finding some mild to moderate physical exercise we could do together. \r\n      * Keto: I’m a pretty good cook but I’ve been doing a keto-ish diet for migraines called the Stanton Migraine Protocol, so food is very low carb these days, with no sugars, so if you want to share a stack of wheat pancakes or to have a vegan partner, that is not me. (I was a raw vegan for a while, but it was too destructive for my particular physiology.) I’ve lost about 15 lbs so far and am more active than I was last year. It’s helping with the migraines too.\r\n      * Housekeeping, maintenance, and organization: With my health stuff, I tend to focus more on work, social time, relaxing, and spiritual things when I’m feeling well, so I am less good at these things, and pay someone to help me. But if I have someone doing chores with me, I’m happy to chat and clean, or do projects together. \r\n      * I can be stubborn – but this also makes me persistent, dedicated, and diligent. Mostly I am flexible and adaptable, but there are certain areas where I am immovable, usually having to do with deeply held values.\r\n      * Mental health: While generally happy and in good spirits, I struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time. The inflammation from the autoimmune disorder made it hard to maintain beneficial neurotransmitters. But now that the inflammation is controlled, my mental health is generally good, well managed and regulated, though I admit the current metacrisis was wreaking some havoc until I decided to shift gears and be more active in addressing it (both the world’s problems and my own). I have a good support network. I have been doing my work independently and with a therapist and other healers for decades, and I’ve made a lot of progress, perhaps beyond the range of what is normal. I think almost everyone would benefit from having a therapist or expanded care team. Thankfully, I’m mostly on the other side of past trauma and it’s rare that occasional remnants come up now, and they are easily cleared. I have become far more resilient and joyful. So, I don’t think it would be an issue in a relationship, but I wanted you to know, because it also speaks to my approach to difficult life situations and ability to resolve them well.\r\n      * Speed shifts: I can move slowly or quickly, depending on the circumstances. I will spend hours and hours researching and considering all the options. But when I decide it’s go-time, things can happen very quickly. It may look sudden, but it will generally be well-planned in advance over weeks or months, even years. These speed shifts can be disorienting if you’re someone who prefers an orderly life that rarely changs. \r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages \r\nI like languages. I just like to swim around, enjoying the Sprachgefühl, so I’m not fluent in most.\r\n      * English - fluent\r\n      * Spanish - nearly fluent\r\n      * Bikol - moderately proficient\r\n      * Tagalog - very basic\r\n      * Bahasa - a little - I can sing a song!\r\n      * German - 1 year in college\r\n      * French - a bit, from watching movies\r\n      * Korean - many basic phrases, from watching k-dramas\r\n      * Japanese - a smidgeon\r\n      * Mandarin - a teensy bit, mostly tai chi terms\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Professional World: \r\nMy professional reality is fairly mundane but kinda neat – I’m a middle manager of staff and operations for various humanitarian STEM projects and organizations, national and multinational. I got my start in this area as an executive assistant, where my skills often led to increasing management of operations and programs. Some have included things like green chemistry, next generation computing, non-linear electro-optics, biotechnology, sustainable agriculture, biofortification, genomics, space, medicine, and AI. I like the big picture. I also like details. I’ve worked in the non-profit, academic, and philanthropic sectors, and on public-private partnerships. I’ve co-managed a portfolio of international projects aimed at alleviating large scale poverty, the effects of climate change, and deaths from micronutrient deficiencies in the Global South. These days my job is smaller and more local, more routine and simple, which leaves me more time for hobbies, spiritual practices, and relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore pictures:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt my favorite tai chi event.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt Fuego volcano, Guatemala, Feb. 2024. It’s currently erupting!\r\n  \r\n\r\nLeaning against a really cool basalt column / Torii gate, 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact Info\r\nYou can email me at serenelotus75 [ a t ] gmail [ d o t ] com. Please tell me about yourself, what you’re looking for, and where you think we might (or might not) align for dating. Or just say hi if you’re curious about anything here. Feel free to send me your date-me doc link if you have one. Thanks, I look forward to connecting!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if I’m not your cup of tea, but you know someone who might be, please feel free to share this document with them. All the best, and I hope you have a wonderful life!"

      "fullText": "﻿Tab 1\r\n👋Hi, I’m David, looking for a long-term partner. Here’s me:\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n* Embodied and physical. Awareness of your body, and spend some time living in it. Dance, climbing, martial arts, etc.\r\n* Intelligent, independent minded. Enjoy discussion. Less swayed by social consensus.\r\n* Love nature. Hiking, camping, or just being outside.\r\n* Warm & caring. Touch, affection, silliness. Care towards others.\r\n* Sexually compatible. High libido, playful.\r\n* Ambitious, purpose driven. Achieving your goals is part of your identity.\r\n* Self-aware. Boundaries, desire for growth, introspection of eg your motivations.\r\n* Social. Enjoy hosting. You don’t need to be a massive extravert.\r\n* Open to kids.\r\n* Feminine.\r\n* Laughs at my jokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎮 Give yourself 0-2 points for each, 3-4 if you’re exceptional. If you score ≥ 18, then you get to go on a date with me. I heard that cocky funny still works even if you get annoyed.\r\nAbout me\r\nI’m 38, 5”8, living in London (open to the Bay Area). Probably monogamous.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent years working to solve AI reasoning before LLMs were big. Now moving to Anthropic to help AI go well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI host creative events, including a pancake party with pañata monster, and an ANT PARTY celebrating the final days of the human empire. I write at epsilonzero.substack.com. I enjoy making unconventional art, including 19 hours on a disassemblable cardboard troll bar for a friend's leaving party, and soon a big shiny 'Z'.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love and want kids. Flexible on parenting style, and I can afford a nanny whether or not you work.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made a flowchart. This is me, attributes (blue), things I do (pink):\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf interested, contact via this form or email with your first date preference: physical (e.g. Rowan Tenpin Bowling, Crazy Golf), co-creating art, or howling at the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy you might not want to date me?\r\n* My empathy is more analytic than reflexive, meaning I see multiple points of view. But if you’re with me, I’ve always got your back.\r\n* You don’t like mathematicians with cool glasses.\r\nPhotos\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis could be us.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently we look similar.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI occasionally go to burns.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI put this in to show off my climbing skills and definitely not my body"

      "fullText": "﻿Just a world traveler looking for a meaningful relationship\r\nThe Basics\r\nAge: 43\r\n\r\n\r\nGender: Male\r\n\r\n\r\nOrientation: Straight\r\n\r\n\r\nHeight: 6'2\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEthnicity: South Asian\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Berkeley, California\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupation: Principal Product Manager for Accessibility at an e-commerce company\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Status: Divorced\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages: English, Telugu (native), Hindi, Kannada, basic Spanish, basic Thai\r\nPhotos\r\n Kiran and India in Times Square. Kiran is a South Asian man with medium brown skin and close cut black hair. He wears a long sleeved button up collared shirt and dark jeans with Hokas. India is a golden retriever. He wears a guide dog harness and sits beside Kiran.  \r\n    Kiran and India in front of a brick building. Kiran wears a burgundy polo and jeans with Hokas. He smiles broadly toward the camera. India leans against Kiran's leg.      Kiran and India in front of the Ed Sullivan Theatre, having just attended the taping of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  \r\nJourney So Far\r\nHello world! - I was born in India, spent a bunch of years in the UK, and now call Berkeley home with my golden retriever guide dog, India. I travel to Seattle pretty regularly for work (1-2 weeks monthly), and through a mix of work and personal adventures, I've been fortunate enough to explore more than 30 countries over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\nI work as a Principal Product Manager for Accessibility at a large e-commerce company, making sure everyone can shop online regardless of ability. I did similar work at other big tech companies. Having access to tech changed my life massively as a blind person, so I'm pretty passionate about making that happen for others too.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been blind since birth, and it's just one part of who I am. I've figured out how to adapt and be independent - honestly, it's made my life an adventure. By the way, I did not name my guide dog “India” for my country of birth. It was just a coincidence. I’ll tell you the story when we talk! If you're curious about how blind folks navigate technology or daily life, don't hesitate to ask. Or check out \"The Tommy Edison Experience\" on YouTube -  that guy is hilarious.\r\nPassions & Interests\r\nMusic: I'll listen to almost anything with a good beat - Bollywood, reggae, Irish folk, Ed Sheeran (current favorite), Indian and western classical stuff... just please don't make me sit through heavy metal! Oh, and I just sing a lot, at home, in the shower or when the mood strikes me.\r\nReading: Total bookworm here. Growing up blind in India meant limited access to books, so now I'm making up for lost time. Huge Harry Potter fan, and currently obsessed with epic fantasies like Game of Thrones and anything by Brandon Sanderson. Sometimes I need a mental break and switch to something funny.\r\nTrains & Travel: Ok, I'll admit it - I'm a complete train nerd. Building an N-scale model railroad layout with a friend's help, and even treated myself to a sleeper cabin on the California Zephyr for my 40th birthday. I went for the experience but I was reliably informed by fellow passengers that the views of the rockies are amazing! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork in progress of a railroad tunnel through a rock cliff. Model of a red rock cliff on a table in a garage. The strata is visible through horizontal divots.  Train tracks come out of the tunnel on  both the right and the left.     A train with a locomotive and two cars emerges from the tunnel portal which is made of card stock. The tunnel  portal is flat and still under construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n A back view of the red rock cliff with train tracks extending to the right. The tracks bend back in a horseshoe. Green hills are visible on the other side of the table.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nI've been lucky enough to visit some incredible places - getting lost in Marrakech's medina with all its amazing smells and sounds, exploring the ancient temples at Angkor Wat, finally walking through Istanbul's Grand Bazaar after reading about it for years. Travel bucket list still includes Yellowstone, Caribbean islands, South America, and Australia/New Zealand. Oh, and a proper American road trip!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kiran and India before the Napa Valley Wine Train. \r\n     Kiran stands in front of the Galata tower in Istanbul, Turkey. \r\n\r\n\r\n Kiran on boat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kiran sits in a helicopter pilot seat. He grins as he fiddles with the controls.  \r\n     Kiran wades in calf-deep clear water before a small waterfall.    \r\n\r\n\r\nNeighborhood Explorer: I'm big on exploring neighborhoods on foot - whether it's discovering hidden food gems in the bay area or wandering a new city. Did a full-day food walking tour in Istanbul once, sampling street food along the way - absolute heaven! Closer to home, I also love things like hiking the Bay Trail or spending a day exploring a new spot like Angel Island.\r\nFood: Serious weak spot for good food - especially anything with creative spices. Thai cuisine is probably my favorite, but I'm game to try most things. Not really into bland food (British years taught me what that's like).\r\nCurrent Projects: Learning conversational Spanish (hope it goes better than my failed piano experiment!). My native language is an Indian language called Telugu, and I also speak two other Indian languages, Hindi and Kannada fairly well. Can order food in very basic Thai - useful skill when you love Thai food as much as I do!\r\nMy Approach to Life\r\nI'm definitely on the introverted side, but a good listener. Happy to chat about anything interesting but equally comfortable with quiet moments - not every silence needs to be filled, right?\r\nFriends would describe me as loyal, curious about everything, and open-minded. I try not to judge others - we've all got our own paths.\r\nI serve on the Board of Trustees for a national blindness non-profit, which feels like a way to give back. Sometimes I do podcasts and write blog posts about blindness awareness. Not trying to change the world single-handedly, but if I can help shift perspectives a bit, that's something.\r\n\"Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.\" - Dumbledore said it better than I could!\r\nWhat I'm Looking For\r\nLooking for something real and lasting. I want to find someone who's as curious about the world as I am - someone open-minded, kind, and who finds good conversation as enjoyable as comfortable silence.\r\nWant a partner who's up for adventures, both local (Bay Area has some great spots to discover) and eventually international when schedules allow. I travel for work pretty regularly, but I'm committed to building something solid with the right person.\r\nI'm a firm believer that relationships should expand our worlds, not shrink them. I'm hoping to find a partner to build a life with.\r\nDeal-Breakers\r\n• No smokers or heavy drugs \r\n• No judgmental or conservative people\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunication & Dating Style\r\nI'd rather meet in person after establishing some basic compatibility - that's when you really know if there's a connection. I'm pretty straightforward, and appreciate the same in my partner.\r\nLong-Term Vision\r\nI don't have children and have made the personal decision not to have them in the future. I respect others' choices regarding parenthood and am looking for someone with similar life goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've built a good life in the Bay Area but would consider relocating for the right relationship. Looking for a partnership where we both have room to grow individually while building something meaningful together.\r\n \r\nSo much world still to explore, so many experiences to share. Hope our paths cross soon!\r\nGet in Touch\r\nIf something here resonated with you, reach out through this form, or shoot me a DM on Instagram or email me at kirankaja12@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated March 2025"

I’m Abe, and I thought I’d share a bit about myself, in case I sound like the sort of person you’d like to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things I like to do:\r\n* Theater. I’ve been acting since preschool, and it’s my biggest hobby. I like everything from Shakespeare[1] to Rocky Horror[2], and I try to be in at least a couple community theater productions a year.\r\n* Engineering. Yes, my day job is as a software engineer, but there’s so much to engineering besides software. I have hobby projects in everything from electronics to architecture, and I try to apply an engineering mentality to a lot of everyday problem-solving.\r\n* Games. I play Dungeons & Dragons (usually running the game) and other tabletop roleplaying games, as well as board & card games such as Magic: the Gathering. I had a chess phase in middle school but was never very good at it.\r\n* Bicycling. I bike as a means of transportation, not so much as a sport, but I do enjoy it, and avoiding dependence on cars is important to me.\r\n* Crafts & home improvements. I’ve built a few pieces of furniture for myself, and done a number of repairs and upgrades around my house. I still contract out the big stuff, but I like having the option of doing things myself.\r\n* Reading. While the internet has somewhat supplanted physical books for me, I still consider myself an avid reader, mostly of fantasy and sci-fi. My preference is for optimistic and/or silly stories over the dark & gritty style that seems to dominate these days, so it should come as no surprise that Terry Pratchett’s Discworld is my favorite series.\r\n* And much more. I can find something to enjoy in practically any creative activity, from linguistics to cooking to politics. A couple of the skills I’m currently trying to learn are singing and videography.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic biographical details:\r\n* 29 years old ❖ male (albeit somewhat gender-apathetic) ❖ primarily attracted to women ❖ single ❖ open to mono- or polyamorous relationships, or just new friends ❖ 6 ft tall (1.82 m) ❖ vegetarian ❖ not religious ❖ doesn’t smoke, drink alcohol, or do any other recreational drugs ❖ fully vaccinated ❖ night owl\r\n* I live alone in Richmond, California (in the East Bay, just north of Berkeley). Not looking to move any time soon, but I might be open to having you move in if we get along well enough.\r\n* I work full-time as a software engineer at an aerospace startup, Astranis Space Technologies. We make communications satellites to bring internet access to underserved areas (and we might also be building the next Global Positioning Satellite constellation).\r\n* I grew up in Santa Cruz, but have also lived in Seattle, Nijmegen, and Santa Barbara.\r\n* I have Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in computer science from UC Santa Barbara (College of Creative Studies).\r\n* I usually vote Democratic, and consider my politics to be mostly progressive, though with some libertarian leanings.\r\n* I don’t currently have any pets, though I love them. My family had cats growing up—I am slightly allergic to them, but that won’t stop me. I’d love to meet any pets you have.\r\n* I’m autistic.[4] I got a diagnosis a few years ago, though in retrospect it should have been obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a relationship:\r\n* Fun conversations. I’ve got a lot of things I want to talk about, from interesting things I’ve learned to projects I’m working on to fundamental philosophical questions, but even better is to sit back and listen as you share something you’re passionate about.\r\n* Physical intimacy. This doesn’t have to mean sex (though that’s great too), but I want to cuddle, to hug, to hold hands. Even better if you initiate.\r\n* Shared activities. We could build something together, go on a bike ride or a hike, or just stay in and watch a movie. Lots of things are more fun as a couple, and it’s easier to go through with something high-effort but rewarding if you’re doing it with someone else.\r\n* Stability. Knowing that we can depend on each other, and that we’ll be there for one another. I don’t want either of us to doubt how the other feels.\r\n* I might be open to having kids, with the right person, but I’d be perfectly fine without as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my values:\r\n* Curiosity. Each new task is an opportunity to learn something. A surface-level understanding, like one might get from Wikipedia, is enough for a casual interest, but when something grabs my attention I want to get into as much detail as possible.\r\n* Charity. I haven’t formally taken the Giving What I Can pledge, but I do donate 10% of my gross earned income each year to effective charities (currently just Givewell).\r\n* Preparedness. My friends turn to me when they need a phone charger, a bandage, or a bobby pin. I’ve taken Wilderness First Aid training, keep a deep pantry, and motivate myself to exercise with the idea that I’ll need to be fit in an emergency.\r\n* Humor. It can take me a while to warm up enough to someone to make jokes around them, but once I do, I’m sure I can crack you up.\r\n* Predictability. While I’m definitely open to new experiences, I find it much easier to enjoy them if I’ve had a chance to plan and research in advance. Surprises are stressful.\r\n* Communication. Yes, it’s a cliché, but I really value being explicit in what you want. I’m not always great at picking up on social cues, so please tell me directly, and I’ll try to do the same for you.\r\n* Kindness. There are a lot of awful things in this world, but we should never be them. I strive to see the best in everyone, to never raise my voice in anger, and to genuinely care about people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out\r\nIf you think we might be a good fit, or just want to chat, text me at (831) 419-9368 or email me at abe.karplus@gmail.com. I hope to hear from you soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions[5]\r\n* Q: Is there a spot open in your D&D group?\r\nA: Yes, and if you’re interested (and interesting) enough, it might be yours.\r\n* Q: What’s your personality type / star sign / Hogwarts house?\r\nA: I don’t put much stock in any of these, but INTP / Pisces / mostly Ravenclaw but some Hufflepuff.\r\n* Q: You haven’t said much about the sort of person you’re looking for. Why not?\r\nA: I think I could be compatible with a wide range of people, and I don’t want someone wonderful to exclude themself just because they don’t exactly match whatever description I gave.\r\n* Q: What’s your favorite Shakespeare play?\r\nA: I don’t (yet) have an overall favorite, but my favorite of the comedies is Much Ado About Nothing, largely because Beatrice and Benedick feel like the only Shakespearean couple who actually are a good fit for each other, not just thrown together for the sake of the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis page was last updated 13 Mar 2025.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I’m currently in a production of Coriolanus with Bard Theatre of San Francisco.\r\n[2] The shadowcast I’m in, BLRHPS, performs about once a month, mostly in San Jose.\r\n[3] Photo by Haley Masch. Costume design by Becky Milanio Koupparis. All other photos on this page are self-portraits.\r\n[4] I prefer this phrasing over e.g. “person with autism”. It’s part of who I am, not a separable property. Consider how weird saying “I’m a person with height” sounds instead of “I’m tall”.\r\n[5] I haven’t necessarily been asked all of these, I just like the Q&A format.\r\n[6] No AI was used in the making of this page—all awkward phrasings in it are my own."

      "fullText": "﻿In as many words\r\n\r\n\r\nTo love and be loved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nA deeper understanding and a genuine human connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship which should last a lifetime, and children, who I would like to see grow old.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI've probably done all of my imbibing, but when I do, I tend to have a cigarette. I don't do drugs. I like walking and running, and I'm thankful for my health. I can drive, but don't. I'll be moving into a home I'll actually own sometime in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm learning to play the piano and hope to become quite proficient at it. I cook a lot, and don't mind vegetables in the slightest. I'm fascinated by physics, yet barely understand. I believe consciousness is a lot like a colour - entirely subjective.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan't survive without music: Floating Points, Róisín Murphy, Daniel Avery, HAIM, Kelly Lee Owens, HAAi, Ezra Collective, Lee Bong Geun, Mozart.\r\n\r\n\r\nReading: Tom Robbins, David Mitchell, Iain Reid, Phillip K. Dick, Cixin Liu, Haruki Murakami.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm: Wes Anderson. And his complementary polar, Roy Andersson. Luc Besson, Guillermo del Toro, Coen brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTV: Mad Men, The Office (only seen American), The Good Place, Gogglebox, Big Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman of the world. Who has a real flair - instruments, languages, knowledge, conversation. Who blossoms rather shies away. An assuredness in herself - and I certainly don't want to be in competition! I'd prefer it if we talked with one another, and that we did this more than we talked about one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot more important than all of that, is a load of love and care.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't exactly had an easy time in this world. I wouldn't want to dwell, but I've missed a lot of the joy and happiness. So to be reminded of such is a real treasure for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit more about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it difficult to do some of the social aspects - which everyone else seems to be able to do - such as, to keep on top/point with the collective discussion; or find the relative clause with the fulcrum in a conversation. I'd probably be a bit better at it if there weren't the games, though. I haven't been diagnosed with autism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a bit of a realist, swaying towards the negative, but idealistic. — An empire is only in a mind! — A pensive deliberator, holistic narrator, where the only aim is to make sense and better understand. Physics is literally everything…\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funniest part about physics is that it's not magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not that serious! I flunk every test, simply because I can… If I'm being told, I need to ask… I'm about as competitive as a wet sock... \r\n\r\n\r\nI hate conflict, but, even still, I could argue until the end of time - I just don't see the point! I don't hold any deep-seated beliefs - about this, or that. I think it's healthy to formulate an opinion, and especially, to care. I'm tired by the general discourse. Politics is literally everything…\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly when humankind brings to an end the endeavour for prosperity, and instead works for the good of humanity, shall we truly prosper and realise wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, as I see it, today...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen everyone is fooling everyone, everyone is a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams and aspirations\r\n\r\n\r\nA job is a job for me. When I dream about my ideal home, it'd be supportive and positive. Lots of time for one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship needs to be tender. I have endless patience, care and concern for the right woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nA side note\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are no more intelligent than, even our earliest ancestors, we simply know more. Our evolution benefits from cooperation, as much as competition, if not more so by cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel, if you spend enough time with a person, you get to know one another, becoming forgiving, inclined, adaptable, agreeable, aligned and assured by them. You grow around one another, in any relationship, community, team, job and life. I'd only hope that we grow together."

If you think we might be a good match, please send me an email at mikest@udel.edu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Info\r\n* Age: 31\r\n* Height: 6'0 (183 cm)\r\n* Looking for: Monogamous relationship, interested in women.\r\n* Location: Philadelphia, PA. Open to moving anywhere within the US, but probably not internationally. Open to a long-distance relationship in the short-term, as long as the plan is to eventually settle down in the same location.\r\n* GIANT RED FLAG: I was previously married and it didn’t work out, so we ended it on good terms. Completely understand if this is a dealbreaker for some people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer / Hobbies / Interests\r\n* I currently work as a computational biologist at a research lab at UPenn. Basically get paid to work on interesting problems all day, so it's pretty cool. But part of me kinda wants to be building something rather than doing purely academic research, so I may eventually try to switch over to biotech.\r\n* Outside of work, one of my favorite hobbies is teaching. For example:\r\n   * I have an educational Youtube channel with tutorial videos about computational biology and programming.\r\n   * I sometimes teach in-person classes at Fractal University, a cool community-based proto-university in NYC. (I’m also trying to start something similar in the Philly area.) \r\n   * Also, sometimes people ask me to teach Python-for-Biologists workshops, and I'm happy to do this for free. For example, I recently taught a 6-hour virtual workshop for a university in Pakistan that invited me. \r\n   * I’m partly doing this just for fun, but it’s also part of a broader interest in alternative, non-traditional education. I basically agree with all the usual criticisms of the current education system, but I also have this Chesterton’s-fence-esque belief that you shouldn't knock down an institution until you’ve successfully built something better to replace it (which might be harder than it sounds).\r\n* Besides teaching for fun, I also like learning for fun. I especially like to learn how things work from scratch (like neural nets, statistical tests, market economies, compilers, or computers).\r\n* I like a lot of the usual ACX / LessWrong / rationalist stuff, for example:\r\n   * Some public thinkers I find interesting (though don't 100% agree with all the time): Scott Alexander, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Julia Galef, Aella, Dwarkesh Patel, Bryan Caplan, Tyler Cowen, Robin Hanson, Sam Harris\r\n   * Some topics I find interesting: prediction markets, forecasting, machine learning, decision theory, probability brain teasers, meta-science\r\n* Other hobbies: \r\n   * running / fitness\r\n   * watching movies (especially horror / thrillers / mysteries)\r\n   * walking around (could be a hike or exploring a city)\r\n   * weekend roadtrips\r\n   * playing guitar. I used to play saxophone too, and kinda want to get back into that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeliefs and Values\r\n* Political views: Center-right. Classical liberalism, markets, civil liberties, freedom of speech, science, secularism, entrepreneurship, techno-optimism, etc. libertarian-ish, but closer to Tyler Cowen than Ron Paul. \r\n* Religious views: agnostic/atheist, but not hardcore about it. somewhat \"culturally Christian.\" open to raising kids in a religious tradition if it means a lot to you.\r\n* Vegetarian (it's fine if you're not though)\r\n* Things I agree with effective altruists about: malaria prevention, effective giving, animal welfare, etc.\r\n* Things I disagree with effective altruists about: AI risk/benefit\r\n* ^ I try not to be too preachy or argumentative about any of these things, and am certainly open to dating people who don't share these views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout You (Hopefully)\r\n* Someone who’s interested in a serious, monogamous relationship and eventually settling down together. I’m not really looking for casual dating or hookups.\r\n* Someone who’s interested in having kids. Ideally I’d like to have at least 2 kids (because it’s nice to have a sibling), and am open to having more if you’d like.\r\n* Someone who’s kind, gentle, caring, honest.\r\n* ^ I almost wrote “intelligent” here but that’s actually not the right word. Maybe “thoughtful” or “curious about the world.” I don’t really care how you score on an IQ test, but I’m looking for someone who enjoys learning new things, exploring new ideas, and engaging with different viewpoints in good faith. \r\n* Other than that, I’m not sure what else to write here. Part of me thinks it would be cool to find someone who shares the same interests as me so that we could nerd out together, maybe teach classes together, learn together, work on projects together. But another part of me thinks it would be cool to meet someone completely different from me, like an artist or poet, so that we could share our different worlds with each other.\r\n* If you think we might be a good match, please send me an email at mikest@udel.edu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Pics\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: this pic is kinda old (2019?). It’s from back when I used to be in the Coast Guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to see more of what I look like, there are a bunch of videos of me on Youtube"

      "fullText": "﻿Brad Levin’s Dating Profile[1]\r\nLast updated: Mar 2025\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nI’m a straight man, poly, 41, living in Sunnyvale, California, half the time with my 7 and 8 year-old children and the other half solo.\r\nWork\r\nI’m a product manager at Google in HR information systems, been there for 8 years; Yahoo and Silicon Valley Bank before that (check out LinkedIn for my deets).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nA few selections from recent years; more on Facebook. \r\nWhy date me?\r\n-Friends describe me as caring, a good listener, energetic, creative, fun, supportive, and reliable \r\n-Romantic partners have mentioned touch and my proactive communication about tough/vulnerable issues\r\n-Values alignment if effective altruism, fitness, family, and lifelong learning are important to you\r\n-We could go to musicals, concerts, performances, conferences, and travel together\r\nDating partner must haves\r\n-Bay area-local\r\n-Female\r\n-------------------------------------- Nice-to-haves section -------------------------------------- \r\nIf basics are enough for you, stop reading now and skip to the Connect with Me section below. If not, feel free to peruse these nice-to-haves: I’m sharing so the particularly curious have a more informed idea of me as a potential dating partner.\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nI’m mostly looking for a primary partner, but am open to other structures.  You can find more detail on my OKC and Plura profiles; including excerpts below. \r\nAlso: what I want may change! I’m open to the possibility of meeting someone great who has in mind a different type of relationship. I also recognize people often don’t know exactly what they want in a relationship, including me. \r\nChildren\r\nI don’t want to father additional children, but am open to dating a woman who already has them. \r\nI’m open to a long-term romantic partner taking an active role in my children’s lives, but I’m not seeking that involvement (I’ve been divorced several years and my parenting status quo is working well). \r\nDating radius\r\nIt's so juicy when the two people dating are proximal! Since I'm not willing to drive farther, I try hard to date folks who live within 20 or so minutes from me in Sunnyvale (or have an unusual situation, e.g. work nearby or don't mind driving to my place disproportionately).\r\nAge\r\n28–49 years old (though this isn’t a strict range)\r\nLiving together\r\nI’m open to and interested in cohabitating with a primary partner, but that’s not a dealbreaker. \r\nOutdoors\r\nMy favorite outdoor activity is tennis, though I also love swimming and frisbee and basketball and frequently run, walk, kayak, and hike outdoors.\r\nBooks\r\nCurrently reading:\r\n-Untamed by Glennon Doyle\r\n-Polysecure by Jessica Fern\r\n-What we owe the future, by William MacAskill\r\nMore Details\r\nPeople close to me have recognized that I’m especially: (i) curious—about the big picture and systems and ideas, (ii) highly organized, (iii) trustworthy, and (iv) sensitive. Myers-Briggs from years ago): ENTJ. Top 5 CliftonStrengths: Harmony, Discipline, Learner, Consistency, Achiever.\r\n🚩Red flags for primary partners 🚩:\r\n1. Pseudoscientific beliefs, e.g. in astrology, manifesting, crystals, non-physics “energy”\r\n2. Criticize often \r\n3. Perennially late and forgetful\r\nWhat’s most important to me; unlikely to change:\r\n* My commitment to parenting\r\n* Involvement in effective altruism (since 2011)\r\n* Staying healthy, e.g. through regular exercise, decent diet, and taking mental health seriously\r\n* Social involvement , e.g. hosting events with friends and community\r\n* Non-religious\r\n* Intellectual pursuits: consuming and discussing podcasts, books, articles, and news\r\nIdeal partner\r\nI completed a relationship workshop that resulted in clarity about what I'm curious/interested (but not in any way expecting) to experience in an anchor romantic partnership. I'll list below some of that clarity; however, due to some feedback I received from a couple female friends, I've now updated this intro paragraph to make sure nobody reads the below as a list of requirements or expectations of a potential partner (which it is definitely not). Please consider the below as predilections and preferences, rather than a checklist of must-haves!\r\nA) Acceptance of my non-monogamy.\r\nFor me to feel like I fully belong in the relationship, I've learned it's critical that my partner openly accepts me having multiple simultaneous romantic relationships, and that I retain the autonomy to pursue new ones.\r\nB) Attraction/chemistry.\r\nI am huge into touch, value sleeping together (in the literal sense), and love doing erotic stuff.\r\nC) Perception that we're close peers.\r\nThis one took a lot of work to develop/unwind/discover in the workshop, and though I've learned it's important for me I'm still not yet sure why. In any case, what does \"close peers\" mean for me? Here's my best articulation, in five points; many of the examples derive from experiences in my own life and illustrate similar life experiences or attributes I seek in a partner.\r\n\"Close peer\" #1: Overachiever. Doesn't much matter in what domain - maybe you're an elite gamer, or excel in fitness classes, or a director where you work, or finished your doctorate while founding a company, or pioneered a popular new form of tarot card therapy (yes I've encountered that latter 🤣).\r\n\"Close peer\" #2: Leader. This might look like you teaching the class, running the workshop, organizing the campaign, driving the process change. Or that you lead by following, e.g. influencing others to put a full effort into the workout, modeling an innovative collaborative learning approach in the classroom that other students adopt, taking the meditation lesson to heart, signing the Giving Pledge and posting it in your house for others to follow.\r\n\"Close peer\" #3: Wild. The freedom and power that comes from intentionally breaking a significant social rule, then thriving afterward. Perhaps you left a religion, risked your education by standing up for something unpopular, exited monogamy, or something comparably high-stakes that risked enduring family or social rejection or job loss.\r\n\"Close peer\" #4: Seasoned. The maturity that comes from enduring a few hard knocks. Maybe you grew up in a household that lacked food security, or your baby died, or you weathered a disability you found difficult, or a parent neglected you.\r\n\"Close peer\" #5: Mentally healthy. You regularly have more spoons than you need to make it through the day, and are more often than not positive and open and emotionally available.\r\n-Someone recently asked me to describe \"my tribe.\" I haven't found mine yet: but an overachieving altruist that wants to overachievingly altruist a bit harder as a result of their primary relationship, sounds like a kindred spirit to me.\r\nExpectations\r\n-I've learned that I expect roughly equal participation when it comes to the work of initiating, planning, and organizing. That means voicing the time and place and activity of proposed dates, initiating touch, proposing dinner plans, etc. should be shared roughly equally (rather than the male doing the disproportionate labor in these areas, as is the norm in heterosexual dating). This also applies to the vulnerable work of initiating the relationship conversations that are needed for a healthy relationship.\r\n-I've also learned that my communication style merits calling out, since I have a particular approach that I've found perturbs some, while prompting others to offer kudos. My approach is this: I try to match the communication mode to the importance of the subject. To illustrate, let's say you're texting me with concerns about where we ate dinner last night. I will try to elevate the mode of communication to something real-time such as a phone call, video chat, or in-person discussion. I might even (gasp!) call you in response to your text.\r\nIn general, the more that feelings are involved or the stakes are high, the more I'll advocate to elevate the mode of communication (text < call < vid chat < in person). My reasoning is: the communication modes higher up the chain offer richer understanding since they include some or all of tone, pace, the opportunity to clarify, more words, pauses (and their absence), facial cues, and the accountability of a real-time conversation. This means fewer assumptions and more information, which I believe improves the odds of the desired twins of communication: (1) understanding and (2) being understood.\r\nThe downside is this approach requires hopping on a call, which some find less comfortable than texting, and can require a modicum of scheduling or driving to the partner, which texting doesn't. Know that for subjects like relationship status and where concerns are involved, I expect the conversation to be real-time, and I will engage using that mode where feasible.\r\nConnect With Me\r\nIf you’d like to get to know me better or just have something to say to me after reading this, feel free to Facebook message or email me.\r\nShare With Someone\r\nLink to share easily: bit.ly/dateBrad\r\n________________\r\n[1] A hat tip to Gina, whose bit.ly/dategina provided much of the structure and ideas you see above (used w/permission).

      "fullText": "﻿Hello Internet!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Julie. I’m 39 years old (which honestly feels very old to type and not representative of how old I feel at all!). I moved to Sacramento a few years ago by way of Brooklyn and San Francisco before then. I have a 4 year old dog named Bailey (see pictures below). I work remotely for a startup in NYC where I am the Director of People Operations (like a more fun version of saying “HR.”) All of my immediate family lives here in Sac and I am really enjoying being close to them after years of living further away. This picture is of my sister (on the right) and I (in black on the left).  \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very happy and have a full life with deep relationships with my family members, long time friends, and colleagues, all who enrich my life. My friends and family would describe me as smart, funny, warm, deeply empathetic, and cheerful. I am very independent and am not creating this doc because I desperately need a man. I am here because I’d like to find someone who will bring something to our relationship -- and I will do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a democrat. I would like to date someone who shares similar political views. I don’t have children, and am not interested in having children, although I am more than fine dating someone who does have kids. I am a very proud auntie to several of my friend’s children. I’m godmother to my cousin’s son. \r\n  \r\n\r\nI travel a fair amount for either work or fun. My most recent international travel has been: India, Switzerland, and Mexico. (Picture is me with my friends/coworkers at a wedding in Mexico)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor fun, I enjoy hanging out with my dog, going on walks in new areas, and taking her to training classes. She may be 4, but she is stubborn! I enjoy going to trivia nights, trying new restaurants, watching classic movies, long walks, exploring new places, exercise, baseball games, bowling, cooking/baking, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeal Breakers for me and/or you:\r\n* I don’t smoke, and wouldn’t be compatible with a smoker.   \r\n* I drink occasionally, but not very much. \r\n* I work what I call “Lazy east coast hours” meaning I start work between 6 and 7 am. As a result, I don’t stay out late, and I'm in bed early. \r\n* I don’t drink coffee, but love the bliss tea at Temple. \r\n* I am not active or addicted to social media. I have an instagram that I have not posted on since circa 2019. I don’t have tiktok. I’m not influencing anything. \r\n* I spend most of my day working in front of the computer and don’t like to spend my time outside of work on my computer or phone. As a result, I am not the kind of person who texts back immediately. I get to it when I have time, unless of course it’s urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for:\r\n   * A man in a similar age range (probably 35-50) who’s looking to meet another person and really get to know her - ie, you’re dating with the intention of finding “your person.”  \r\n   * A man who’s passionate/enthusiastic about life.\r\n   * Someone who’s career driven\r\n   * Doesn’t smoke\r\n   * Not a heavy drinker\r\n   * Not a big partier (aren’t those days behind us?)\r\n   * Someone who cares about family\r\n   * Low ego/humble\r\n   * Kind\r\n   * Patient\r\n\r\n\r\nSound like you?

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me - Ja\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone inspired me to write this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt feels strange writing something like this for strangers to read, but it’s a bit better than a dating profile that lacks so much information and results in perhaps not the best decision making.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find any of this a tad interesting then please reach out and perhaps we can get to know each other in person.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doc is a work in progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGender: Male\r\nLocation: Watford, UK\r\nYear of birth: 1987\r\nHeight: 5ft 9\r\nEthnicity: East Asian\r\nSexual orientation: Straight - looking for a woman\r\nLocation: London, UK\r\nLanguages: English, Mandarin\r\nAttachment style : Fairly secure, tendency to be anxious.\r\nLove languages: Favourites are acts of service, physical touch, quality time. But to be fair, I respond well to all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in China and moved to the UK when I was little.\r\nWe moved around a few times in my childhood and I’d say it shaped me quite a lot. There are positives and negatives to this and I feel that slowly I’m experiencing more of the positives than I did as a child and young adult.\r\nAll of my education has been in the UK so I’m quite a mix of cultures, but I see that as an adult I’m probably more British (if I had to lean a particular way) than Chinese given my environment and social group. With that said, I always felt a bit of an outsider - quite introverted, very different home life compared to my peers at school, one life at home and a completely different life outside of home - things felt a bit disjointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife situation:\r\n* I work in marketing and recently went freelance (again) - it’s busy - I work from home\r\n* I’m a homeowner (and recent cat owner - yes, she’s very cute, and yes she’s occasionally a menace)\r\n* I can drive and have a car\r\n* I can get into all of central London in less than an hour\r\n* I don’t smoke or take drugs - I tend to be a minimalist when it comes to \r\n* I only drink socially and occasionally - recently I’ve been not drinking at all due to a meditation programme I’m preparing for (March 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m like\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat inspires me\r\n* People who care about others\r\n* People who work for something greater than themselves\r\n* People who are willing to surrender to life and allow\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not saying I aspire to be all of these things, but they certainly inspire me\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy\r\n* One-on-one conversations with my friends, and the occasional stranger.\r\n* Cooking and eating - especially if other people are involved.\r\n* Going on hikes, cycling, camping, going up mountains, road trips, natural environments.\r\n* I love the Scottish Highland, and Edinburgh (very happy childhood memories).\r\n* I’ve recently rehomed a cat called Mura - she’s cute and an occasional menace. So, now I’m a cat person in the making. I had a hamster as a kid but it didn’t really like me and I wasn’t too fond of him either so that doesn’t really count.  \r\n* I enjoy conversations about the future, technology, life, what we’ve learnt about ourselves, other people’s stories.        \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personality (at least my blind-spot ridden perspective of it)\r\n   * Ambivert - quite happy in my own space in peace and quiet, but totally down for being sociable with the right crowd. I tend to be quiet rather than needing to be vocal by default.\r\n   * I’m very close to a handful of friends. I feel blessed to have such friends and they are like family to me.\r\n   * I don’t enjoy small talk most of the time but when it’s about getting to know someone new then it can be fun too to begin with.\r\n   * I’m a dreamer. Perhaps I’m ADHD - I’m not sure. I daydream all the time (perhaps very compulsively) about everything. Business ideas, people and relationships, ways to improve the NHS, why my cat behaves the way she does, what a conversation meant several years ago, whether we can have a viable economy based on currency that has another dimension of value attached to it, about meditation and yoga practices, about the nature of birth and death, how people grow and develop, about why my circuit breaker tripped for several days but is now back up and working perfectly fine, if a curry sauce filled tofu ball would be good bit of food, …\r\n   * I’d say I’m quite spiritual but not in the usual sense of the word. I’m highly logical with an open mind. I don’t have beliefs. I’m purely in this life, with this body, with very limited perception of reality. But it is growing and I leave the door open.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValues\r\n   * Open-mindedness - to me this means not being bought into anything. Staying open to being shown something new or contrary to current perspective.\r\n   * Continuing to grow in awareness\r\n   * Moving towards doing what’s more right and relevant for the world - this is not to say do not respect personal wants, but just recognising that personal desires tend to be formed by the world we reside in and they are highly transient - and it relates to the point above. With growing awareness I recognise that my desires are a consequence of my physiology, emotions, and memories - and as I become more conscious in my actions then the interactions of those elements also change. So, my desires change when my consciousness changes. Moving towards choice of desire from compulsive desires.\r\n   * Rightness is debatable\r\n   * Authenticity - I do feel that everyone is already authentic, there is nothing about a being that isn’t - your actions and thoughts are not someone else's. I mean in the sense that we move towards growing awareness and express ourselves by our choice rather than by our compulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want in a relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have a companion to travel through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone to share with\r\n   * Food - I enjoy eating together, tasting new dishes (especially desserts )\r\n   * Maybe some hobbies and projects - but not a dealbreaker\r\n   * A home\r\n   * Ideas and thoughts\r\n   * What else?\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone to learn from and learn with.\r\n   * Intellectual curiosity - talking about concepts, situations, the future, history and bouncing ideas feels important to me.\r\n   * A drop of spiritual curiosity - some amount of thirst to know more of life, consciousness and what we/I don’t know.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who really wants me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone I really want to be with.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully, someone to have children with. So ideally aged between 25 and 35. But I’m not going to be strict on this - it’s just what seems to make sense given that desire.\r\nBut with that said, I’d rather live a happy life than have kids at great cost to wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical, emotional, and sexual intimacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utmost mutual trust that we’re in this together. Being on the same team.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalling out bullshit and being able to step in when needed. Not letting undesirable things just happen without being addressed. Again, same team - doing this together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities that I find attractive in a partner\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Feminine confidence\r\n   * Gentle temperament but not meekness\r\n   * Able to go with the flow as well as being adamant when needed\r\n   * A curiosity for life's mysteries\r\n   * Wittiness\r\n   * Intellectual intelligence to an extent\r\n   * Low maintenance and easy going nature - but still with a bit of fire\r\n   * Straightforwardness\r\n   * Adaptability (I may be projecting a bit here)\r\n   * Groundedness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome boundaries\r\n\r\n\r\nLong distance relationship - it’s a no for me. A LTR doesn’t feel real to me and seems like a dream life not real life. I know it can work for many people, but I don’t feel this is the situation I’d thrive in.\r\nPerhaps later on if there needs to be some distance due to short term work, looking after parents, etc then that’s fine - just doesn’t seem right to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like communication to be straightforward with no game playing. Don’t make it harder than it needs to be. I truly feel there are much better ways to use our energy than playing around with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we could have together\r\n   * A warm loving home and family where we nurture each other.\r\n   * Deep mutual trust that we are here for each other.\r\n   * Great intimacy - physically, emotionally, sexually, and any other way that comes to mind.\r\n   * Financial security and freedom - we can work on this together. So that we can pursue things other than careers and money motivated endeavours - do things that are more alive.\r\n   * Support each other in our pursuits. Even have some things that we pursue together.\r\n   * Have kids and grow into wonderful guides for them as they grow.\r\n   * Each of us puts effort into being the best for the other - then there will be no getting bored, things going stale, the flame dying out. Selfishly selfless route to endless passion and energy.\r\n   * Share in the responsibilities of life and home. As equally as possible. Recognising that it doesn’t necessarily mean the physical actions are completely equal. But we do what’s needed.\r\n   * A really fun time and fun life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said, that is my brain dump for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s meet!\r\n\r\n\r\njyue87 [at] gmail [dot] com"

I'm on the market, and if you're looking at this, then I guess you are too. This should help us navigate those awkward first steps.\nI'm looking for someone to live and love with long-term while we both support each other's goals. I've never been married and while I'd be happy with a lifetime partner, I don't know that marriage itself is the right setup for me. That said, I have been in a 5+ year relationship. In the meantime, let's just be nice to each other and test our compatibility. We can see if there's an intersect in what we're looking for and do what seems right in the meantime.\nMy ideal partner has obsessions and can't help but share them. She has clear goals and a plan to achieve them, even if they're hard as hell. (I'm talking to you, ambitious women other guys are afraid of.) She takes care of herself now, knowing our bodies get harder to maintain as we age. Also, no kids, religion, or perpetuating animal suffering through food choices. She wants to make a positive mark on the world.\nI take on challenging goals. I'm mostly through the manuscript of a nonfiction book on a technical topic. I've published in both academic journals and popular media. I've also grown two nonprofits from scratch. I set up the org and funding mechanism that helped a long-active male contraceptive to a Phase I human clinical trial. I also facilitated campaigns to get a better voting method implemented in two cities, which had never been used in government elections before. I've raised millions of dollars for causes I care about. I enjoy being active and have a ton of different hobbies.\nLocation-wise, I can live anywhere for my work and recently chose Philadelphia after referencing a simple heat table I put together factoring in cost of living, walkability, transit, and bikability. I actively do not like cars and choose not to own one. I do have a license and can drive though. I have to do this visiting Kentucky during the holidays.\nOther randomness. I care about financial independence. I budget for charitable giving and give publicly. I also love science and am rather methodical at most things I try my hand at.

      "fullText": "﻿January 2025\r\nAbout me\r\nI am 23, I live in Oxford, studied in my native Australia, and grew up mainly in India.[1] I feel moved by the plight of current people and non-human animals, but also find persuasive the basic longtermist argument that the future is big and important and changeable. So for now I am trying to help make the transition to AGI go well.\r\nYou can see some things about me on various places online, including the EA Forum, LinkedIn, Goodreads, Google Scholar, and my Substack subscriptions.\r\nThat is fairly cold and impersonal; it is perhaps more fun and interesting to get to know each other by talking. But for now, here are some less work-y things about me:\r\n* I like to read, play board games and ~any sport, hike and camp, talk about philosophy and physics and photosynthesis and occasionally non-alliterating things.\r\n* I am very honest and value open, frank, fairly direct communication with others. I tend to ask quite a few questions, mainly because I am curious to learn about other people’s experiences and ideas!\r\n* I am not very artsy; beyond the occasional poem (e.g. here, here), and some elegant mathematising if that counts, my creative output is meagre.\r\n* I have rather little familiarity with pop culture and I mostly do not regret this. But it means I wouldn’t be a very good conversationalist on such things.\r\nHere are some photos of me doing things I like. And this is what my[2] face looks like:\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nApart from demographic things (I have only ever been attracted to women, this seems very unlikely to change; being a somewhat similar age/life stage is helpful) and unsurprising things (one’s partner being kind and clever and caring and calm and courageous is always nice) I would like to be with someone who is:\r\n* Morally serious - the stakes are high; there is so much to protect; doing the right thing matters. I think I would struggle to deeply empathise with and respect someone who had a more blasé attitude to improving the world. It seems less important what exactly you care about and want to work on.[3]\r\n* Intellectually curious - talking about ideas is quite important to me, and it would be hard to spend lots of quality time with someone who isn’t interested in ideas. But what you study/studied, who your favourite philosophers are, what your favourite theorem is etc is less important.\r\nBeyond that, of course, it would be nice if we enjoyed some of the same activities, but I feel like that is more malleable.\r\nIt would clearly be nice to live near each other, but I am open to exploring a relationship with someone who currently lives far away.[4]\r\nI am open to ~any preference on whether to have kids, I have quite mixed thoughts.[5]\r\nYou can email me at oscardelaney0@gmail.com.\r\n________________\r\n[1] My parents were doing ‘global health and development’ work before it was cool in EA ;)\r\n[2] Is my past self really ‘me’? What is the relationship between ‘me’ and ‘my face’? Tricky questions!\r\n[3] I care quite a bit about EA as a project, and somewhat about EA as a community. It might be helpful if you do too, but I think the ‘morally serious’ frame of mind is the more important part.\r\n[4] I quite like living in Oxford, but would be open to moving for the right (work or romantic!) opportunity.\r\n[5] I like spending time with kids and would all else equal prefer to be a parent (and am generally pro-natalist!). But all else isn’t equal, e.g. if AGI comes this decade it could be a very tumultuous few years where I want to focus fairly hard on work without caring for young kids. But I don’t know."

      "fullText": "Skip to content\n💘\nDating Tanner\nGet Notion free\n💘\nDating Tanner\nHi, I’m Tanner — a curious, beard-bearing San Franciscan who loves laughter and adventure. Hoping more cute than cutting edge in a virtual “we bumped into each other in an electronic version of a cafe” sort of way. I laugh a lot, am usually dressed for an afternoon of relaxing and focus on goals and personal growth.\n💘 Shoot Your Shot?\nMessage me your favorite fun fact and let’s compare notes\n😊\nLet's talk\nor tanner.godarzi@gmail.com\n🤠 Dating Me Is Like\nHave you ever thought “I wish I could find a man with a great beard who makes me laugh, is emotionally self aware, resilient, knows how to communicate, has a zest for life and adventure then very conveniently lives in a delightful neighborhood that’s iconic of San Francisco” Just your luck - it’s me!\nAlways laughing and having a hearty time. I’ve been described as the connective, gooey tissue that brings people together (thanks?). Carrying a camera (sometimes film) to document my life and occasionally bumping into friends along the way. Continuously discovering and rabbit holing from urban planning’s effect on social interaction and familial development to Arabian pirates of the 17th century.\nWhat I’m into:\nExploring The Bay through photo walks, new restaurants, and hikes\nStaying centered with meditation, yoga, and reading\nWriting short reflections (and sometimes long rabbit holes)\nSharing adventures outdoors with people who appreciate curiosity and play\nI’m thankful to have a prosperous career in tech making a positive impact of people’s lives while setting myself and my family for long term success. I care deeply about the direct my moral compass points aiming to do the most good for people possible. Currently I’m at Vercel, doing just that, on Brand Marketing with a crew of adventurous and humble folks.\nThe full history is at my LinkedIn should you care to indulge.\n🍟 What My Friends Would Say About Me\n⭐ Jack “Convivial with refined tastes, strong loyalty, and great taste in memes”\n⭐ Tymn “He can’t be described in one sentence”\n⭐ Ala \"He's a sincerely nice guy, very social, who loves travel, metal music, and going down the rabbit hole on niche topics like cults and city planning.”\n⭐ Wheels “Tanner is like a cosmic gumbo. Smooth, nutritious, surprising, and a real treat.”\nAsk me about my cool friends\nALT\n💘  Shoot Your Shot?\n😊\nLet's talk\nor tanner.godarzi@gmail.com\n🤔 Some Basics About Me\nName: Tanner Godarzi (you can also call me Tan)\nAge: 33\nLocation: San Francisco, CA 🌁\nBackground: Half Persian and the greatest hits of Europe mixed in with some Spanish zest\nPersonality type: Extroverted with friends, contemplative and meditative elsewhere\nWork: Currently at Vercel building vercel.com. Previously, Engineering for Brand and Marketing at Notion (how meta)\nMusical tastes? Anything poolside at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs to driving industrial beats like Nine Inch Nails, cinematic and expansive scores from Godspeed You! Black Emperor to nostalgic hipster indulgences in Arcade Fire.\nInfluences? Many, but I consider Anthony Bourdain, Trent Reznor and Alex Calderwood as my heroes well. I’m huge fans of my friends and draw inspiration from the community I live in.\nAll things media? I prefer my news to come from strange visions in my dreams sandwiched between Ken Layne of Desert Oracle and financial news from Bloomberg. Otherwise, occasional art house film or 4 hour Youtube explainer on a mundane topic.\nWhat else? A mystery to continuously unravel over a glass of wine\n⭐ My Values\nI deeply value for myself and people I surround myself with a sense of community and curiosity about the world. Balancing sensitivity with durability. Finding moments of meditation for inner peace during the weird times we find ourselves in. Finding as much joy exploring far flung places like an out of the way cheese in Antibes as I would an unexpected run-in with a friend in the city.\nKindness carries the day. Let’s prove the doubters wrong.\n🔭 Who I’m Looking For\nSomeone intrigued to make it this far! I’m looking for someone to go on coffee dates and my soulmate — is that too much to ask?\nConcretely, I’m interested in women in my age group (Millenials) in San Francisco. But don’t let that dissuade you! I’d love to hear from you if you’re outside The Bay or on the cusp of the generation. I’m interested in a long term relationship and infinitely excited about the idea of kids with someone who’s health forward, ambitious and caring.\n💃🏻 Date Ideas\nFilm camera photo walk through San Francisco\nA deep game of We Are Not Really Strangers\nWine bar hopping\nHaha, what if we spent a weekend in Palm Springs\n🌐 Where I’m At On The Internet\nInstagram (@tannergodarzi)​\nTanner GodarziTanner Godarzi​\nTanner GodarziSo, You Want To Throw A Dinner Party​\nDinner With Friends​\nHowdy, I'm Tanner — a real person on the internet.​\nwww.linkedin.com​\n🏹\nShoot Your Shot\nName\nSocial Profile (Instagram etc)\nPhone\nEmail\nTell me a bit about you\nSubmit\nNever submit sensitive personal information, like passwords, through Notion Forms.\nReport abuse"

      "fullText": "﻿Email: tom.arrow42@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Keith\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\nWhy am I single?  \r\n* My work life (sea below) has taken me out of the country for significant periods. \r\n* I used to be insecure about expressing romantic attraction, although this has been worked through.\r\n* My face is not very expressive, and I seem much colder than I actually am to a lot of people. I convey strong emotion much more with verbal explanation than with any visual cue.\r\n* The places I’ve lived are not bustling with like-minded people. \r\n\r\n\r\nBasic info\r\n* 5’8”/173cm \r\n* Straight  \r\n* Ideally looking for a monogamous relationship, but open to casual dating\r\n* Want children in 5-15 years, but I don’t think this is a dealbreaker\r\n* Muscular build, lean but not shredded\r\n* Atheist\r\n* 27 years old, British\r\n* Non-smoker, rarely drink but not teetotal\r\n* First-class Chemistry degree\r\n* Vegan\r\n* ~£50k salary, own a flat in Glasgow with a small mortgage\r\n* Highly extraverted\r\n* Main love language is physical touch, followed by quality time  \r\n\r\n\r\nWork life\r\nI’ve decided against publishing this on the Internet. Feel free to enquire. \r\n  \r\n\r\nCharacter traits\r\n   * Discipline, drive, and executive function\r\n   * Very low in neuroticism and anxiety, with a stable mood (I’ve got graphs lol)\r\n   * When I’m sad, I solve this through reflection and talking about it; “cheering me up” isn’t a thing\r\n   * Regrettably low in some kinds of curiosity\r\n   * Direct style of communication  \r\n   * Hard to offend\r\n   * Aside from a few skeletal anomalies that haven’t meaningfully limited me, I have excellent health (as do most of my family)\r\n   * Probably too invested in some kind of general protagonist identity, and working on being warmer and more human\r\n   * I very much have “cognitive empathy”; I care about people/things, but don’t feel their emotions with them.\r\n   * I’m becoming more disagreeable and willing to challenge people as I age. I’d like to believe I keep this constructive and make sure not to leave others feeling attacked. If your tortilla policy is mental, or I think a key part of your philosophy is wrong, you’ll hear about it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDaily routines\r\n      * I am more of a morning person; staying up late into the night without a good reason is not a thing for me\r\n      * I reach full alertness and energy exactly 20 minutes after getting up\r\n      * I rarely suffer from low energy and nap only infrequently\r\n      * This is predicated on my daily rhythm giving me good sleep and nourishing food, I absolutely crash without these\r\n      * My meals are very big, and I hardly snack. \r\n      * I abhor “killing time” at home and prefer to spend time intentionally. This most frequently comes up in relationships around partners wanting to spend lots of time watching TV/film. If you want me to do this, it’s best to sell me on why that show in particular is worth a deliberate decision to watch it. Just putting something on as a low-effort way to spend an evening will not fly. \r\n      * Work out 3 days on, 1 day off.\r\n      * Each night, I record what I did that day in a “Memory Book” and have every single day for 7 years. Be prepared to feature!  \r\n\r\n\r\nRomance & the Bedroom  \r\n         * Pretty happy with vanilla stuff, but I have discovered a dominant side and would like to explore this more. \r\n         * I’m not that kinky\r\n         * I’m not sure I would have believed it if I’d read this a few months ago, but I’ve unlocked a part of my mind that experiences sex in ways very similar to women: erogenous zones and mind-splitting orgasms that last several seconds and aren’t related to ejaculation. \r\n         * High libido and I actively want near-daily sex, but my desire to go for multiple rounds can be greatly hampered by not having eaten enough or physical tiredness\r\n         * You’ll generally get a lot more out of me by starting early in the evening, or earlier in the day, with a coffee\r\n         * *friends mocking me for going to the Roomba recharge station*\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve had one relationship lasting a year, a handful of four-month relationships, and a fair number of short-term flings or one-off encounters. I’m in touch and on good terms with many of these people, and don’t hold grudges with any. None of these were “bad breakups”, and I have never fought with a romantic partner. My longest relationship was polyamorous for the second half. I feel we made this work, and it is something I could continue doing. That being said, it came with costs that at present I would prefer not to pay in a long-term relationship. If you’re poly and otherwise think we could be a match, please don’t rule it out on these grounds!\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to take relationships quickly and am comfortable living together earlier than most, I think. As I grow close with people, I can become an absolute Snuggle Bear, but this is dependent on chemistry. A friend with benefits, who I cherish but do not feel this chemistry with, instead described me as a “Roomba”...\r\n  \r\n\r\n________________\r\nShow, don’t tell\r\n  \r\n\r\nI host a lot of events for my friends. This one was a “Dating Discussion Forum”, to give people a platform to have a frank, open conversation about their experiences with dating.   \r\n\r\n\r\nWarhammer is my main hobby. Painting the miniatures and playing the game with friends occupies the nerdy part of my mind most of the time.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve taken up the gauntlet to bag all of the Munros. I’ve hiked barely a tenth of them so far. Appetite to go up a hill with me is appreciated!  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a specific smile that comes out when I drink specialty coffee.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI’m a bit functional when I cook for myself, but I love putting effort into cooking for others!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fitness is very important to me. I was the least fit child at my primary school, and through consistent effort since, have achieved a number of things I am truly proud of. On a bad day, I can do 6 muscle-ups. Earlier this year, I joined the 1000-pound club in powerlifting. Now that I’ve leaned down again, I’ll run a mile in comfortably under 7 minutes, and 100m in 16 seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\n         * I can do sin(x) functions in my head, and could teach you how \r\n         * Made Richard Dawkins laugh\r\n         * Estimated to eat 92.3kg of houmous per year\r\n         * Exchanged typewritten letters with a romantic interest whose name I never knew through unsuspecting Berlin baristas\r\nYou\r\nBasic info\r\nThere are very few unequivocal green and red flags for me, and many different ways I can be attracted to a person. Most of my red flags are fairly common: jealous, controlling, unable to accept they are at fault, and boring. I list ones specific to me below.  \r\nGreen flags/nice-to-haves:\r\n         * Large breasts\r\n         * Muscular/athletic figure\r\n         * Confidence/assertiveness\r\n         * Aged 20-33\r\n         * Self-initiated passion projects, ideally nerdy ones\r\n         * Clear and open communication styles \r\n         * Outdoorsy/not dependent on creature comforts\r\n         * Morally motivated, seeking to make the world better\r\n         * Has done really hard stuff\r\n         * High IQ and at least middling EQ\r\nRed flags:\r\n         * Actively religious or superstitious\r\n         * Not vegan and unwilling to discuss my ethics on this with an open mind\r\n         * Significant lack of interest in their health, fitness, and longevity\r\n  \r\n\r\nWork life\r\nI want to date people who impress me, and a big part of that will usually come from their career goals. Ambition is helpful, but at a minimum, I want a partner to know who they are and what they are working towards. The minutiae of this are not so important to me, and there are very few professions that constitute red flags. Essentially, I want to be impressed by a woman’s grit. Tell me how hard you’ve worked and what you can overcome! \r\n\r\n\r\nFinances  \r\nI’d like to think I am generous with friends and partners, and recognise that there are (dwindling) expectations on a man to spend money on a woman. That being said, I am far more excited to date someone who sees being a homeowner as a signal of good financial security and executive function than someone trying to marry rich. I intend to donate too much money for that to ever pay off. With that said, I don’t have any expectations for a partner’s income or financial situation, provided that they can take care of themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bedroom\r\nI would like for a partner to be of a similarly high sex drive and be committed to this remaining an exciting activity. Ideally, an empty field in the summer would be a perfectly acceptable opportunity to get it on. Eagerness to understand my weird tantric capabilities, and consensual power imbalance would be much appreciated! There’s not much more of a filter I want to apply here; the rest can be figured out with dating.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you feel like we could be a match, feel free to reach out by email!"

      "fullText": "﻿Overview\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI’m building a life of impact, intellectual curiosity, physical activity, and a growth orientation. I’d like a partner who values and shares these areas, if not the specifics in each area. I can seem hard on the outside, but I’m a romantic and I promise that there’s a warm, soft core.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere’s how excited I can get about ideas! (Very old.)\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nIn a castle in Spain, after picking a padlock to get there.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nI accidentally got a cat during covid. I’m lucky to have a lot of friends who look after her when I’m traveling.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nNot my child. But isn’t she cute?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe basics\r\n* Male, age 44, seeking female, age approximately 35 to late 40s, for a monogamous relationship akin to (or actually) marriage.\r\n* I live in San Francisco. More below.\r\n* I don’t need to have children. I’d be excited about it with the right person, in specific situations. See below.\r\n* Email: m@redheron.com\r\n* Facebook profile. I don’t post much, and less publicly, but you can see mutual friends at least. Twitter. I don’t post much there either. It’s a bit out of date, but you can also find me on OkCupid.\r\nMore detail\r\nImpact\r\n* I’m involved in nuclear fusion, because I believe that the world needs clean, cheap, abundant, safe energy in order to limit climate change and create abundance.\r\n* I’m passionate about structural improvements to our governance systems. I’m also working on a software project (writeup) to help people vote faster, with more information.\r\n* I spend a lot of my time on another software project -- a collaborative note taker, task manager, etc. (That sounds boring, but I promise that it’s not!)\r\nIntellectual curiosity\r\n* I love discussing things that we’ve read or heard, or pondering how something works, or listening to/watching something together and trying to figure it out. I especially love finding people who are experts in some random field but are patient enough to let me question them about what they are doing, why it makes sense and how it works. I especially especially love tag-teaming this quizzing with a friend.\r\nPhysical activity\r\n* I run, ski, back-country ski, snow camp, backpack and mountain bike. At the moment I’m working on running further. Have you thought about how far one can run in a day, and how much further it is than we can backpack?! Imagine setting up a base camp in a national park somewhere and then running all over the place for a few days. You could see so much!\r\n* I’m totally excited to try your sports. These are just the ones that I’ve gotten sucked into so far.\r\n* I’d like to learn to dance. I’m pretty terrible at it, and cuban salsa did not go well, even after a year of trying. The next experiment is fusion (dance, not energy, in this case).\r\n* I’ve done a lot of urban exploration. I don’t do as much now, but I’ve picked every lock in the Conservatory Flowers in Golden Gate Park and I still love climbing cranes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth orientation\r\n* I’m not in coaching or therapy at the moment, but I’ve gotten a ton from coaching in the past.\r\n* I’m all over the various growth books and recently read Good Inside and The Courage to be Disliked.\r\n* I strive to improve my close relationships and bring my best self to them; and to take feedback gratefully.\r\n* Don’t confuse this for woo. I’m a rational atheist who wants to take the good stuff from the touchy-feely hippies, but also keeps discovering that they have more good stuff than I thought. (Who knew that blindfolded contact improv could be so much fun?)\r\nSampling of things that I like talking about\r\n* The world\r\n   * What's the right way to address climate change? And population growth?\r\n   * If you could change something about how American democracy works, what would it be? Is western democracy on a decline? How can we fix it? (I think that America may be on the verge of what I call the “New American Consensus”, and with it an era of great accomplishments.)\r\n* Tech\r\n   * What would I do if I had good VR/AR hardware?\r\n   * How can software be better? How can we build it better? What would a debugger designed for functional programming look like? (IMO: very different, and very awesome.)\r\n   * How can we collaborate more effectively?\r\n   * How will the world change when SpaceX gets Starship working?\r\n* Other\r\n   * How can I be kinder, warmer and gentler, but still help groups to get things done?\r\n   * How can I get into somewhere I shouldn’t?\r\n   * How can I travel with less gear?\r\nWhere I live\r\n* I live in San Francisco.\r\n* I’ve been here for nearly 25 years and know a lot of wonderful people.\r\n* I live in a community of 4 buildings, one big shared garden, 15 adults and 6 children (more planned or on the way!), 3 hot tubs and lots of cats. We each have our own units, so we don’t have to agree on how clean our kitchens, bathrooms, etc are. It’s co-livinging for grownups and it’s great. You might love it too. 😀\r\n* I’m loath to leave SF permanently but I’m also really eager to find an amazing partner and am willing to look in many other places for her. Europe (especially Berlin) and New York tug at my heart. I recognize that I might get lured away from SF, but I’ll also try to lure you here. Maybe we can travel a lot.\r\nChildren\r\n* I used to be pretty strongly opposed to having children. I’d be married at least twice by now if it weren’t for that.\r\n* I still don’t need to have children, but now I can now see a path where I’d be excited to have children: with a partner who is highly aligned on values and goals, and in a community like the one that I live in, with lots of social contact built in, so that parenting isn’t as isolating.\r\n* The two biggest things that changed my mind about children are (1) seeing how different parenting is when done in community, and realizing that the future will be less awesome if a whole group of us opt out of having children."

I’m Emily, a 24-year-old woman looking for a monogamous male life partner. I live near Philadelphia, but am not settled yet.\nI center my life around close relationships and doing good for the world. My brain works in optimizey ways, but I also trust intuition, feel deeply, and love being playful.\nWhat’s noticeable about me in relationships is that I’m an intense person! I naturally go all in and move fast when aligned with something. I feel profoundly grateful to be alive, so I try to live with maximum agency.\nMy lifestyle is minimalist and utility based (though not robotic-y!), and this leads me to be very open-minded about how to get things done. I adore unconventional ideas (e.g. I sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor with no pillow), and highly value authenticity and creativity.\nUltimately, my favorite moments are the mundane moments just being present, especially with close friends. And I love when the people in my life balance me to be more spontaneous, accepting, and joyful for the sake of being joyful.\nwhat i’m doing with my life\nI’m concerned about existential risks like climate change and potentially AI. I’m especially concerned the US is heading towards authoritarianism and won’t be able to address these problems. To help, I travel across the country to win key elections and protect democracy. I love my job, though it requires a nomadic lifestyle. I’d consider finding a different job to make logistics work with my life partner.\nWhen I’m not working, I spend time in nature (I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail three years ago!), talk with friends and build community, read, journal, and experiment with life!\nwhat i’m looking for\nA transcendent kind of love. A best friend. Someone who feels warm and like home. I find my deepest friendships make me not fear death, so maybe something like that…\nOn a practical note, it’s challenging to know what makes people click! So err on the side of reaching out. :)\nsome logistics\nplease reach out!\nLife’s short, please take the chance! I made this because I want to be contacted! Let’s set up a low-stakes phone call and see if we vibe. :)\n💌\nMessage Me Here\nBounty: I’ll give $1,234 to the person who introduces me to my husband.\nBut- What if you’re my husband?\nhaha jk…\nunless…? 😳"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\n🧘‍♂️\nGeorge’s Date-Me Document\nGet Notion free\n🧘‍♂️\nGeorge’s Date-Me Document\nRetired future poker player, current nomadic uncle, aspiring intentional live-r.\nIn an even earlier lifetime, I was a data scientist and quit my corporate job to play poker. But then, I realized all I did was swap my corporate treadmill for a competitive-gaming exercise bike, and that I hadn't actually solved the incongruence of driving to the gym and taking the elevator to get on an exercise machine to work off all the processed foods I stress ate. So now, I’m walking outside instead, constantly checking how much longer it’ll be until I’ve reached my step goal for the day.\n(To be clear, this is all strictly a metaphor. I've never actually been motivated to consistently go to the gym; I have a very high metabolism that tricked me into thinking I was healthy when I wasn't. Also, my metaphors may need work. Help me please?)\n🔍 About Me\nName: George\nAge: 35\nHeight: 5’8\nLocation: Nomadic (with a temporary home base in the SF Bay Area)\nOccupation: Funemployed explorer (aka whatever I want)\nReligion: Agnostic but closer to spiritual\nI quit my corporate job in 2019 and spent the next few years studying (running programs / developing strategies / memorizing decision trees) and playing poker because I wanted to see how good I could be at something that more matched my skillsets. At the same time, after becoming aware to how much my achievement mindset had driven my life for so long and how I no longer wanted that, I’ve decided that poker will likely just be a way for me to offset costs going forward and not the primary focus of my life. So I've become interested in traveling (seeing the world, meeting cool people, having new experiences), and I was on an extended roadtrip for almost 2 years across the US (primarily through National Parks and secondarily through art museums—yes, my header picture is from Chihuli in Seattle). More recently, I was in Peru for a month and LOVED it, and I’m currently embarking on a Europe⇒Africa⇒SE Asia cruise.\nLonger term, I know that I'll likely want to be geographically flexible or nomadic. I'm not sure for how long I'll want to travel or if I eventually want to establish a more permanent home (forming a community of likeminded people does interest me intellectually). I'll very likely be interested in having children at some point, because I find children to be wonderful learning beings and I'd like to help with and be a part of that process, but as I've learned over the years, I never truly know what future George wants. No matter how convinced I am at any moment that past George was wrong but NOW present George is completely right, I know it's all a trick. I think.\n🕵️ What I Am Looking For\nRelationship Goals:\nOpen to both monogamy and nonmonogamy: I’ve traditionally only been in monogamous romantic relationships but I’ve grown to appreciate the nonduality of relationships (i.e. a spectrum from acquaintances to more platonic friendships to primary life partner) and realize that our love isn’t finite. Ultimately, I do expect to be monogamish (if not monogamous), as my energy and interests tend to hyperfixate more than those of most polyamorous people do\nChildren: Yes please! And hopefully more than 1 (I was an only child)! I ultimately would like to be a stay-at-home parent and would be thrilled if my partner would want to as well, especially for the early years of the children’s lives\nPlatonic connections: open and excited about connecting with people even if it doesn’t lead to “my one true soulmate” (/whatever the nonmonogamous version of that is)\nIdeal Partner:\nMore motivated by her own desires than those of other people and of society\nChaotic good: rules are only guidelines and I’d hope that kindness and care for other beings trumps all. But also, some such guidelines hopefully are more important than others (i.e. radical honesty with each other and with our children is near the top)\nAdventurous: more inspired by new experiences than by comfortable routines\nNeverending mutual teasing (including of ourselves). For example, my college application essay was about the tribulations of growing up short (I was robbed of a storied NBA career by these struggles)\nToni Stark (if she exists) is my ideal\nVery ADHD conversations: as you can probably already tell by my liberal use of parentheses, I get distracted easily in my writing, and I can confirm that conversing with me is a similarly disjointed experience\nValues:\nCuriosity and open-mindedness: relatedly, an understanding that the absence of evidence does not mean the evidence of absence\nAuthenticity and honesty (both with oneself and with other people)\nPlatinum Rule >>> Golden Rule: Treat others the way THEY would like to be treated. Abiding by the Golden Rule places your expectations onto other people, and that's a common source of conflict in society\n💭 I Spend a Lot of Time Thinking About\nThe balance between self-acceptance and self-improvement\nThe Dunning–Kruger effect and, in particular, how it applies to understanding myself\nParenting and education: I have extremely contrarian views on these topics, ranging from wanting many humans of varying ages contributing to childcare (so not just a nuclear family, and definitely not just a nanny while the parents are obsessing over their careers) to believing that traditional schooling is a huge misprioritization of what’s actually important for kids to learn\nEnergy work, spirituality, healing, plant medicine, and altered states of consciousness—and how they all are interconnected for me\nThe Midwit Meme: One of the most helpful developments growing up weird has been the realization that the modal (/most popular) opinion is by definition not the most informed one\nUnderstanding my edge: This isn't meant at all in a cut-throat competitive manner, but it's more like, if I have a disagreement with an opinion, I'll want to identify why my opinion has merit, what other people are missing, etc. Usually, this means I'll default to those who I think know more than me and not deviate much from these priors based on my own limited experiences, but sometimes, this means I'll have extremely contrarian opinions. (See my poorly executed exercise analogy as an example)\nMisaligned incentives: For example, the healthcare industry (and in particular, big pharma) doesn't get paid for treating diseases; they get paid for managing the symptoms. Understanding this is essential to understanding the difference between lifespan and healthspan\nThe many different ways society perpetuates the status of the American aristocracy and how money in politics takes power away from the people\nHow oftentimes (especially after thinking about the prior two points), I just want to leave society and live on a farm with the important people in my life\nThe teachings of Thomas Bayes, William of Ockham, and Robert J. Hanlon: For example, it's extremely probable Epstein didn't kill himself\n🔥 Favorites\nHobbies 🛶:  deep conversations about anything; being out in nature (especially activities that involves boat-like apparatuses because I don't exactly float in the water); basketball; board/card games\nBooks 📚:  Anxious People; My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry; Civilized to Death; Sex at Dawn; Antifragile; The Black Swan; The Scout Mindset; The Biggest Bluff; The Untethered Soul; The Highly Sensitive Person; Nonviolent Communication\nTV Shows 📺:  The Good Place; Crazy Ex-Girlfriend; Sex Education; Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt; Atypical; As We See It; Modern Love; Ted Lasso; Strange Planet (basically anything that makes me both laugh and cry, although it's not difficult to do either)\nFood 😋: All of it but especially sushi. One of my in-progress goals is to eat less meat (and probably animal products in general), but giving up seafood would be the most difficult part\nBoard/card games 🃏: Codenames. It's accessible for non board-game-fanatics and quick enough to not be a multi-hour ordeal. Historically, I've been extremely into more complex strategy games (i.e. Agricola), but my enthusiasm for repetitively grinding these games to try to perfect a strategy has definitely waned. Besides, is there a hunter-gatherer version of Agricola? Accumulating resources in an attempt to grow indefinitely just doesn't get me going like it used to…\nI love all water activities\nBest show ever!\nFind someone who looks at you like…\n👀 Fun (no, really!) Facts About Me!\nI'm passionate about learning in general (especially about how/what/why people think) but am even more passionate about sharing everything I learn with other people (but having to tone it down because no, my friends don't always want to read 500-word essays on obscure niche topics, since no one is as excited about the brain's default mode network, the viability of gift economies, or basketball analytics as me. But in the one-in-a-million chance that you are... you know what to do...)\nI both practice time-restricted eating (usually a 6-7 hour window) and eat 60+ pieces of sushi at AYCE sushi. I’m looking to do a longer fast at some point, but that calling hasn't arrived just yet\nI love sharing stories, but I'm also an especially confusing story-teller. There's often really no logical/linear order to my tales. In addition, my sentences will often have way too many clauses, because I get distracted way too easily while simultaneously maintaining the desire to finish my original thought\nI once memorized 75 digits of Pi in 1 week during a high school math class simply because I was bored (and the 75 digits were taped to the wall), and I could probably still do it now if I were given an hour to prepare. On the other hand, if I get introduced to more than 1 person at a time at a social gathering, I won't be able to remember a single name. I've been known to refer to people by descriptors until it becomes too cumbersome to say \"my friend's sister's boyfriend\" repeatedly in a story. Especially if he also has a sister.\nOne could probably play bingo with the catch phrases I routinely utilize. Some of the words one might include on said bingo card: “incentivized”, “societal”, “status goals”, “evolved”, “midwit”, “right-tailed”/”left-tailed”, “zero-sum”, “subconsciously”, “threshold”, “confidence-level”, “update [one's] priors”.\n📱 Let’s Connect\n💌 georgesdatemedoc@gmail.com"

\r\n\r\n\r\nover the Salisbury steak I hated:\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are we eating tonight?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this streaming\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom a photo on my phone.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMore than tackle football\r\nduring fifth-grade recess\r\nwith real Nerf football\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI grimace, but not\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom this trip\r\n\r\n\r\nto a memory’s lane\r\n\r\n\r\nof pre-teen products and uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wince with a wont\r\n\r\n\r\nfor a time when I engaged\r\n\r\n\r\nmore wholly in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot virtually\r\n\r\n\r\nor electro-socially.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat pink football was lost\r\n\r\n\r\nin the open cesspool \r\n\r\n\r\nin the front yard,\r\n\r\n\r\na sewage maw in the earth,\r\n\r\n\r\ncovered by

      "fullText": "﻿Sam’s Date Me (or Be My Platonic Lifemate) Doc\r\nCreated Jan. 2025\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLife is more vibrant when shared: Emotional reactions are heightened when another person is in the room. Experiences are richer when you see them through someone else’s eyes as well as your own. Ideas are enhanced when they volley between two brains. And we need companionship to feel safe and soothed. So I’m looking for someone(s), romantic or platonic, with whom I can share this brief and miraculous existence. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m easily influenced by the mood and energy of those around me, so I’m looking for someone who brings out the person I want to be. If you are compassionate, curious, encouraging, extraverted (or at least prone to Doing Stuff), and enthusiastic, read on. \r\n\r\n\r\nVision\r\nIn my ideal life, periods of fairly regimented, healthy routine are punctuated by wild adventures. \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the week, and some weekend days, I anticipate following my morning routine (including meditation), going to work, going to the gym (I lift weights daily, even though I’m bad at it), and having a couple of remaining hours to engage in activities that are both self-improving and genuinely fun, as energy permits (at home, like reading, studying languages, or chatting, or out, like taking a dance class, seeing a play, or going for a hike). I’d love to share these activities with someone. I’m a fan of Cal Newport’s philosophy and techniques for creating structure that allows for productivity without pushing oneself. I would like my home (whether rented or owned) to be attractive, neat, and quiet; I care about aesthetics, and I’m easily distracted by clutter or unpredictable interruptions. I enjoy cohabiting, but I don’t want to be influenced by unhealthy habits like poor sleep or media addiction, so unless the cohabitant(s) is/are conscientious and wellness-oriented, I’d rather live alone. This routine is valuable to me not out of some kind of moralizing asceticism—and in fact, I don’t view it as ascetic—but because it’s the structure and peace I need to do the kind of work that excites me while staying well and relaxed. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut life is for the alive, my dear (as Mrs. Lovett would say), so weekends and vacations are for experiencing what the world has to offer. I easily feel delight and awe in the wacky things that man and nature have created, and I’m novelty-oriented, so I’m not all that particular about what I do for recreation. I am, however, especially interested in travel, as well as entertaining at home by hosting themed parties and game nights. Although during my daily life I prefer to be relatively frugal, I don’t mind spending money on the experiences I value (and on maintaining my well-being), whether that’s play tickets or Michelin starred tasting menus. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you see yourself as compatible with at least one of these elements of my vision? I’m open to a cohabiting partner, an adventure buddy, or both. I’m game for romantic or platonic … but it would be really neat to fall in limerence. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interests of transparency, I’ll admit that my life currently doesn’t reflect this vision as well as I would like. Even though I look reasonably successful on paper (e.g., have lots of grants and publications, worked at a “big three” consulting firm, etc.), I’ve struggled to find my groove since the beginning of the pandemic, which coincided with me finishing my postdoc and starting my “real grown-up job.” Health, relationships, and non-ideal housing have all been an impediment, and I’ve been experimenting to find out what works better. Some major changes are in the works for the next six months, including moving and launching the career that aligns with my strengths and passion. It’s perhaps immature to believe that a romantic relationship can “fix” a person, but I don’t think that’s quite what I’m looking for; I am hoping, though, that an infusion of new and positive energy, and a supporter of my routines, will serve as a nudge in the right direction. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nI would describe myself as resourceful, curious, irreverent, passionate, and idealistic. Superpowers: Generating ideas, perspective-taking, offering reassurance, designing solutions, evaluating the trustworthiness of research evidence (i.e., detecting BS). Weaknesses: Attentional control, trusting my decisions/trusting the process, managing energy, patience, singing. \r\n\r\n\r\nStats\r\nLocation: Seattle, WA for ~two years starting mid-2025 (doing a second postdoc), with some flexibility to work from elsewhere at times; I am open to long-distance, including an arrangement where I fly to you for a month at a time and for long weekends, but be aware that I don’t like communicating via email or text\r\nEducation: PhD\r\nAge: 37\r\nGender: AFAB, nonbinary-ish\r\nSexual orientation: Androphilic; open to cis men, trans men, masc-leaning nonbinary, and maybe even a butch lesbian or two (for romantic partners—open to all genders for friendship!)\r\nRelationship style: Prefer kitchen table poly\r\nKids: None and don’t want any; may be open to serving as a fourth or fifth “parent” to a partner’s kids\r\nReligion: Respectful atheist with Buddhist sympathies \r\nPolitics: Pragmatic, favoring left-leaning goals but not necessarily left-leaning means; “Can’t-we-all-just-get-along”-ism; “They-should-put-me-in-charge”-ism 🙃\r\nSubstances: No alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis (though I don’t object if others use them wisely); rare psychedelics for therapeutic purposes \r\nNeurotype: Probably more allistic than average in the rationalist and EA communities, but more autistic than the general population; neuro-piquant, if you will\r\n\r\n\r\nBeliefs and values\r\n(I don’t expect you to share all of these beliefs; diversity of thought is useful! I’m just offering them as information about me.)\r\n* The world would be saved if everyone practiced perspective-taking and compassion and everyone made decisions using cost-effectiveness analysis with the best available evidence as inputs. (In other words, all you need is love and science.)\r\n* Physicalism is true, or at least, there’s no reason to believe otherwise; everything is made of matter and there is probably no parallel spirit world or soulstuff. Spiritual practices and rituals, however, can be worthwhile. \r\n* Capitalism has pros and cons. Markets are magical mechanisms, and I’m skeptical that there are other ways of allocating resources that would be comparably effective, but I’d really like to see markets (and governments) totally redesigned in a way that incentivizes wellbeing-maximization rather than promoting insecurity-generating competition, concentration of wealth, pointless and addictive consumption, etc. I haven’t formally studied econ or political science, so that’s kinda where my hopes end. I am curious about these topics, though. \r\n* Most forms of entertainment media and social media are bad for our brains and trick us into thinking they’re worthwhile, in an analogous process to that promoted by addictive substances. They’re too stimulating and too instantly-gratifying. This is true of other products as well, like processed foods. \r\n* Science rules, but it’s often performed suboptimally. Fixing this is my career mission—one that I’ve thought about for years and have finally started to pursue. \r\n* Aside from physical pain/discomfort, insecurity (about status, lovability, etc.) is the core source of most suffering. If people felt “good enough” and psychologically safe, they’d be much less defensive, more able to accept others’ perspectives, care for others, etc. In other words, feeling interpersonally secure is intrinsically as well as instrumentally good. \r\n* Emotion is good. Life should be interesting. I want to cry more and laugh more. \r\n* It’s fun to be critical, but it’s also fun to appreciate mediocre art and suspend disbelief.\r\n* Probably some other stuff, but you’ve already spent long enough reading my stream-of-consciousness manifesto, so let’s move on. \r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies and interests\r\nThe items on this list range from “stuff I think about every day” to “stuff I do once a month” to “stuff I aspire to try.” \r\n* Metascience\r\n* Psychology, economics, philosophy\r\n* Effective Altruism (as a question about how to do the most good, not as a fixed set of “approved” cause areas; my favorite objective function is different from most EAs’)\r\n* Travel\r\n* Creative writing\r\n* Reading\r\n* Language learning (did French in school, learned some ASL a few years ago, now beginning Japanese)\r\n* Designing party games\r\n* Performing arts, but not live music (I get antsy sitting there when there’s no visual stimulation or plot)\r\n* Thrift shopping\r\n* Dancing (I’m told I’m a good dancer at weddings—I just make it up as I go along)\r\n* Baking and other one-off “arts ‘n’ crafts” type activities\r\n* Outdoor walks/hikes, with the caveat that I’m cold-sensitive\r\n* Psychedelics\r\n* Buddhism, meditation; curious about relational meditation practices\r\n* Lotsa other stuff too—teach me about your hobbies! \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout you \r\nI’ve already articulated much of what I want; here’s all of it in one place. Yes, I know these lists aren’t grammatically parallel. Forgive me. \r\n\r\n\r\nQualities I’m seeking: \r\n* Compassionate, warm, and encouraging\r\n* Curious and intellectually engaged\r\n* Extraverted and/or active; “yes and” attitude\r\n* Communicative about own mental state\r\n* Has own hobbies and interests\r\n* Has a vision/direction for life (does not need to be a traditional career), preferably one that includes reducing the world’s suffering\r\n* Enthusiastic about at least some portion of my proposed lifestyle, or already practices it\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities about which I care less than most people: \r\n* Height (short kings yes please … but also tall kings)\r\n* Body type (I’ve dated hefty bears and wispy dudes I could beat at arm wrestling)\r\n* Age (27-57 should work)\r\n* Race (no preference)\r\n* Religion (you do you, given a reasonable level of skepticism/critical thinking; I love ritual)\r\n* Sexual compatibility (I think it’s more strategic to optimize for other stuff ‘cause I have no problem with you getting these needs met elsewhere if we’re not a fit)\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers: \r\n* Cynicism\r\n* Frequent or persistent low mood/low energy\r\n* Meanness or disdain towards neurodivergent people, trans people, sex workers, or fat people … actually, let’s make that meanness or disdain towards anyone! \r\n* Dogmatic beliefs, especially political beliefs in the vein of “the ‘other’ is an unforgivable bad guy”\r\n* For cohabitants\r\n   * Preferring to keep the space cold\r\n   * Clutter\r\n   * Noise (e.g., practicing instruments audibly)\r\n   * Most dogs\r\n   * Poor sleep habits\r\n   * Addiction, including behavioral addictions; however, being in recovery is a plus\r\n   * Requiring a vegan-only kitchen (I’m pro-vegan, but I have been medically advised that it’s a bad idea for me, so I’m pescatarian at home)\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus qualities: \r\n* Can (and wants to) teach me new things, work on projects together, or study together\r\n* Romaaaantic\r\n* Decisive, dominant, and/or confident without being arrogant or judgmental\r\n* Rich enough to help finance my scientific ventures and/or buy me presents (hey, a person can dream)\r\n* Open to relocating, especially somewhere that doesn’t get too cold\r\n\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\nIf you think we might be a match, email me at my first name dot my last name (which is Bernecker) at the Google internet mail. (I hope that’s obfuscated enough to fool robots while remaining intelligible to humans.) Please tell me what you’re seeking, highlight a few things in this doc that made you think we’d be a good fit, and mention any concerns about our compatibility."

      "fullText": "﻿Dave Kasten’s Date-me Doc\r\nHi, I’m Dave Kasten!  I’m mainly writing this date-me doc in search of a primary/anchor partner to build a life and have kids with, but if you’re awesome and think we might be a good fit in a secondary/casual partnership, I’d love to talk to you, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basics[1]:\r\n* Man\r\n* 39\r\n* Jewish (And I need my partner to respect that I am, but I don’t need them to be).  \r\n   * I go to Shabbat services a couple times a month, and I host a Shabbat or other Jewish-holiday-related dinner at my home once a month-ish.  I don’t keep kosher and I use electricity on Shabbat. (I’d be willing to explore shomer shabbos / shomer kashrut if you’re Jewish and it’s meaningful for you that your partner be as well.)\r\n* Ambiamorous.  Ideally looking for polyamorous relationships these days, but have been in big, important monogamous relationships too in my life.  Open to either.\r\n* Never married, childless.\r\n* Wants to be married, wants kids (Preferably biologically related to me, but mainly it’s about having a relationship with a kid/kids where they fundamentally see me as a dad).\r\n* Recovering McKinsey consultant, works in AI policy.  Very solid financial health. \r\n* Lives in Washington, D.C., but would move for the right set of circumstances.\r\n* Has Substack, will travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m like:\r\n* Extroverted, energetic, a great plus-one to a party where you don’t know anyone. An incredible wedding date for introverts; I’m your wingman.  On your typical Friday night cocktails, Saturday wedding, Sunday morning brunch story arc, I’ll have fully-established inside jokes with 5 of your friends by the time we’re packing up the car to head to the airport on Sunday afternoon. \r\n* Friends, colleagues, and past partners generally tell me that they think that I’m one of the most optimistic people they’ve ever met. (This usually surprises me, I seem to be unable to update on it.  Maybe what I see as my cynicism just helps me mourn the bad news earlier and privately and move past it faster?)\r\n* I’m deeply intellectually curious; my friends once told me that the most common way I begin a conversation is, “So, it turns out” and then me infodumping at them.  I also sometimes do this before bed.  I hope you consider this adorable.\r\n* My best friend considers me the literal most-invested-in-their-friends person he’s ever met.  My wedding toast for him was 9 minutes long and the best thing I’ve ever written.  (Video available upon request.)\r\n* I love kids; I am writing this doc the morning after running around with all my friends’ kids at our friend group’s holiday party for a few hours.[2] I’m also proud of my signature “making moose antlers out of my hands” move that for some reason most toddlers think is the funniest thing they’ve ever seen.\r\n* I go to therapy; have sorted out a lot of my own bullshit, but still working on it.\r\n* A good chef, but much more motivated to cook a big meal for a partner or friends, I tend to be pretty basic when cooking for myself.  \r\n   * As of Sept 2025, I’m starting to learn how to bake things, too!  My bagels passed the “my shabbat dinner liked them the next morning” test.\r\n      * Uh, to be clear, I mean that I sent them home as goodie bags.  It’s not like I seduced my entire shabbat dinner and served them breakfast the next morning.\r\n* Exceptional bartender and I love sharing cocktail nerdery with others.\r\n* Enthusiastic but bad dancer; working on the latter part.  Particularly into blues and fusion.  Competently incompetent at East Coast Swing.\r\n* Surprisingly good at putting together furniture and household repairs.\r\n* Fan of Survivor (even though someone needs to take away Jeff Probst’s game theory textbook), Star Trek: Lower Decks, Person of Interest, The Good Place. The Truman Show may be one of the greatest movies ever; so is Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Spy Game is the best spy movie. \r\n* Some favorite books: Seeing Like A State by Jim Scott, The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, The Scholomance series by Naomi Novik, The Laundry Files spy novel series and Merchant Princes fantasy/revolutionary series by Charlie Stross, Bureaucracy by James Q. Wilson.\r\n* I’m not wealthy by tech industry standards, but by any other industry’s standards my retirement accounts are doing well and I expect that will continue to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you have a flag?” – Eddie Izzard:\r\n* I was in one really big relationship for 13 years that ended about 2 years ago.  In some ways, you might think of some of my baggage as looking more like “divorced” than “never married.”\r\n* I’m mostly estranged from my biological family due to their past bad behavior; my best friend’s family is sort of a second family to me.  I am really proud of the found family I have, but am very unlikely to have support from biological family when it comes to babysitting, etc. one day. \r\n* I had one bad anxiety/depressive period in my life about 5 years ago; a combo of antidepressants, doing the work in therapy, and major life changes have made this much less of a part of my life.  I’m not ashamed of you knowing about the time my brain tried to kill me, but I think you should know there’s some hopefully-low-but-nonzero chance it could happen again.\r\n* Infrequently have Midwestern guy hangups that make me slower to communicate emotions on embarrassing things than I’d like (though this is much less of a thing for me than a few years ago).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a primary partner:\r\n* [Dies in embarrassment]\r\n* [Okay, I’m back.]\r\n* Is a woman or relatively femme-coded nonbinary.[3]\r\n* Wants kids (bio or adopted), ideally wants marriage.\r\n* Has traditions that matter to them (Jewish or otherwise).\r\n* Romantic and relationship dynamics:\r\n   * If monogamous, has a strong sex drive.\r\n   * If polyamorous, there’s more flexibility here but I’d still want to have some flavor of meaningfully-sexually-intimate relationship.\r\n   * A truly asexual child-rearing partnership would be challenging for me unless casual nonsexual physical contact (like cuddling on the couch or spooning while sleeping in the same bed) was part of our dynamic. I think it’s an essential emotional carrier wave for me.\r\n* Is curious about the world; has something they’re passionate about, whether or not it’s the same things I’m passionate about.\r\n* Listens, asks questions, calls me out on my bullshit, but also fundamentally wants to find a way to be on the same team.\r\n* Loves jokes, makes callbacks in conversation to earlier parts of the conversation, plays with words and ideas. \r\n* Someone with main character energy about them, someone who takes stands and stands up for themselves.\r\n* Someone who actually tries to woo me and desires me, and who I feel the same about and treat the same way.  Someone who wants to build a shared life together that grows out of who we are now individually, but is bigger than that.[4]  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I hope we’d be like together:\r\n* Build a home that’s warm and joyful, where we give each other freedom and trust, and have the security of knowing we’re on the same team.\r\n* Craft a life where we incorporate and create rituals and traditions that matter to us.  Mine are usually Jewish, yours don’t have to be.\r\n* Carve out time explicitly for date nights and time together, plan ahead for when each of our careers and lives get busy, stay connected even when the demands of our commitments strain at us. \r\n* Fight fairly and kindly with each other when we have conflict (any relationship does). \r\n* Travel, at least once a year, to somewhere new.  Have at least 50% of our vacations involve lounging somewhere warm for a bit by the waterside.\r\n* Share burdens fairly and equally (I grew up in a home where my dad was a stay-at-home parent for about half of my childhood, so being deeply committed to household tasks feels much more normative to me than for most straight men I know)\r\n* Have a kid or two, raise them in a home that feels happy and safe, where they’re protected just enough that they can take risks and skin their knees and be daring, knowing that we’re there to catch them if they truly fall, but letting them stand on their own two feet and make their own choices and feel real freedom and agency. \r\n* Challah and dancing to goofy music in the kitchen, warm dinners, curling up on the couch listening to the rain fall.  The whole thing that makes it worth it to be alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to contact me:\r\nEmail: dave [dot] kasten [at] gmail [dot] com.  Thanks!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] Yes, I am aware the sum total of these adds up to a bit of a cliche.  At least I don’t live in Berkeley 😀.\r\n[2] The children decided that their glowsticks were magic wands that could make me become dead, alive, or a spooky giant monster, and flickered this state accordingly every 45 seconds or so.  I got good at comedic pratfall death scenes.\r\n[3] I don’t love my way of describing this!  If you have better ways of describing what you think I’m saying here, let me know.  \r\n[4] This might seem like a, “duh” requirement but I’ve had some bad and bruising experiences in DC with women who are basically just auditioning me for the job requisition of “Jewish husband” and expect anyone given that job to twist themselves into a pretzel to fit into their hypothetical wife’s existing life as-is."

I used to once, I don’t anymore; would love to get back into it without doing the creepy do-dance-classes-to-find-dates thing that so many guys seem to do?\nDog/Cat mom - I have lived with both, don’t currently have my own, pets are great\nBetter memory/aesthetic sense than me? :)\nProbable no’s:\nVery actively religious/political - I don’t mind it but you’ll be unhappy w my disinterest\nDefault sarcastic/cynical - I lean earnestcringe\nAuthoritarian/Statist - I value individual freedom/liberty with limits, dislike govt overreach\nCrypto/web3 - I’m not anti-crypto, but have been quite turned off by vapid vibey crypto girls. iykyk.\nOpen to living at least part time in Singapore - I do want spend time with my parents and amazing incredible sister who someday I hope you have the fortune to know as well as I do.\nhit me up!\nif you’re pickin’ up what i’m puttin’ down, find me on text or twitter or email!

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me Doc - Aaron Boddy\r\nAt a glance…\r\nLast updated: 27th December 2024\r\nName\r\n\tAaron Boddy (he/him)\r\n\t  \tAge\r\n\t32\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tLiverpool, UK\r\n(But spend a lot of time in London)\r\n\tInterested in\r\n\tWomen, aged ~27-37\r\n\tWhat I do\r\n\tCo-founder of an animal welfare NGO\r\n\tGet in touch\r\n\tRelationship setup\r\n\tI’m polyamorous, I have a transmasc husband (who I live with) and a cis girlfriend (who lives on a different continent).\r\n\tLooking for…\r\n\t…people to play games with, talk about ways to improve the world, and make each other laugh :)\r\nMore specifically, I’m looking for a partner based in the UK to spend weekends with—someone who I really vibe with, where we can support and inspire each other to grow.\r\n\tWhat does my life look like?\r\n\tI am very much a home-bod(d)y. \r\nI live in Liverpool with my nesting partner (it’s a 4-bed flat so we each have our own bedroom and home office). I love being at home surrounded by people I love and my things.\r\nThough my work does require me to travel quite a lot (I’m very fortunate that I get to go to interesting places and meet interesting people), and as a result I’ve started to enjoy being out of the house more and more.\r\n\tWhat could our life look like?\r\n\tA mix of cozy weekends and shared adventures. Whether we’re hanging out at home, playing games, or watching something fun, or heading out to explore new places, I imagine us having a relationship full of laughter, great conversations, and mutual support. We’d inspire each other to grow, share our passions, and make space for what truly matters to us, all while enjoying the everyday moments that make life special.\r\n\tHere’s a paragraph about me written by my husband: \r\n\tI’ve honestly never met anybody else like him. \r\nPensive, methodical, and startlingly intelligent; he has a very unique approach to life which I really admire. \r\nHe’s very quiet, gentle, and sensitive. He gets quite distressed by conflict, and he’s deeply passionate about the things he cares about. He’s incredibly kind, generous, and thoughtful, and he’s probably the most patient person I know. \r\nOh, he’s also incredibly silly and mischievous (when he gets to know you).\r\n\tHere’s a paragraph about me written by my girlfriend:\r\n\tPros: Aaron is extremely dependable and honest. I feel like I can tell him anything and he won’t judge me for it, but will also not jump to be agreeable with me (an autistic superpower!). Out of all my partners, he is the one I feel that I can share my deepest thoughts with. I know that if he says he will do something, he does. He’s pretty decent at physical directions, tech stuff, and organizational management, which is a huge + for me because I get to benefit off his help in these domains. \r\nCons: He is more talkative with people that he has already met a couple times before and generally prefers for other people to initiate/lead conversations. If you are bringing him to a social event where he doesn’t know others well, then you should try not to leave him to his own devices. Aaron also hasn’t dated many people in his life and therefore may not have the smoothest way to rizz you up. He is also a little bit clumsy, but is currently on a workout plan so that might change in the future. And he is allergic to cats (apparently), but with enough advance planning, he can be around cats for an extended period of time.\r\nOther considerations: I really value the impact-oriented life that he leads so the optimal UK girlfriend he gets should ideally actively support him in this way of life rather than be a distraction from it. I would be disappointed if he was derailed from the goal of reducing suffering as much as possible/practical in this world. \r\n\tAbout Me\r\n* Effective Altruism - I co-founded a charity called Shrimp Welfare Project (SWP) after going through the Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program. We focus on reducing the suffering of the billions of farmed shrimps. My work at SWP is probably the thing I’m proudest of in my life to date.\r\n“Shrimp welfare” can sound odd at first, but the pitch is surprisingly simple: \r\n* 230 billion shrimps are alive on farms at any moment, more than any other animal.\r\n* The evidence suggests they’re sentient and can suffer.\r\n* They often suffer through routine practices such as having their eyes cut off (to induce spawning) and suffocating to death at the end of their lives.\r\nCo-founding SWP was motivated by my deep desire to reduce suffering as much as possible, and it’s been a rewarding journey balancing pragmatism with ambitious goals. The work connects deeply with my values around compassion, effectiveness, and finding innovative solutions to neglected problems.\r\n* Autistic (self-diagnosed) - In 2023 it was mentioned to me that I might be on the autism spectrum. The more I looked into this the more it seemed to ring true, so I typically identify as being autistic (though I haven’t gone through a formal diagnosis). \r\nOne way in which this manifests is that I (currently) have an eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). It basically means I have a very limited diet of preferred foods, and the thought of eating other foods triggers a physiological fight-or-flight response.\r\n* Polyamorous - I’m in a polyamorous relationship currently, so you might hear me in one sentence talk about my husband, and in another sentence talking about my girlfriend. I’m married to a non-binary trans-guy (who is also in a relationship with a trans-woman). And I also have a cis-girlfriend.\r\nI consider myself to be straight (which is a little confusing as I’m married to a trans-guy). We dated for ~5 years before he came out as trans, and have found our romantic relationship still works well despite it no longer being sexual - which itself isn’t such a big deal when polyamorous. \r\nI think the definition of Relationship Anarchy appeals most to me, with all relationships just growing into whatever suits them best. That said, I find terms like \"nesting partner\" (for my husband) or \"Comet\" (for my girlfriend in America) helpful for explaining the dynamics.\r\nHobbies and Interests\r\n* Making & Creating: Projects and activities I enjoy to try and mindfully unwind.\r\n   * Animation: I love animated movies (my degree is in computer animation), particularly Pixar. I’m also writing a musical with my metamour about animation, which has been great fun.\r\n   * Musical Instruments: I enjoy picking up piano, ukulele, or drums in phases—mainly for the fun of seeing quick progress. Right now, I’m in a piano phase, though I often cycle back to the others.\r\n   * Construction Sets: Building LEGO (or Nanoblocks) is my go-to for unwinding. I have a desk setup in the living room to work on sets while watching TV with my nesting partner.\r\n* Media: Like most people an avid consumer of media… \r\n   * Reading: Generally non-fiction, my favourite book is Sapiens. I also love candid autobiographies like Strong Female Character, or I’m Glad my Mom Died. My Goodreads is here, if you’re curious.\r\n   * Music: The Beatles are my favourite band, and I love vintage covers (e.g., Postmodern Jukebox).\r\n   * Comedy: Game-changing shows such as Nanette, Inside, and Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999.\r\n   * TV & Film: Shows like The Good Place, Fleabag, and movies like The Cornetto Trilogy. I also enjoy so-bad-it’s-good films and ambitious narratives from Charlie Kaufman or Richard Linklater.\r\n   * Games: I love story-driven single-player games (The Last of Us series) and 100%-ing open-world games while listening to audiobooks. My favourite board game is Gloomhaven.\r\nWhat I’m Looking For\r\n* Relationship Style - I’m looking for a partner based in the UK to share romance and intimacy with. I deeply value my relationship with my nesting partner (we have a strong bond but not a sexual relationship) and my \"Comet\" girlfriend (though we only see each other every few months). So it feels strange to say as someone with two partners, but I sleep alone most nights, which surprisingly enough, is starting to feel quite lonely… \r\nWhat I feel I’m missing is a local-ish girlfriend (while I’m based in Liverpool, my idea of \"local\" is pretty flexible and would include most UK cities - especially London, where I spend a lot of time anyway). \r\nI’d love a relationship that fits a more traditional rhythm: seeing each other regularly, spending weekends together, or staying with each other for longer stretches when it works for us.\r\n* Good Vibes & Value Alignment - I’d love to connect with someone who feels like they just \"get it.\" A partner who resonates with sides of me like effective altruism or animal welfare. Sharing a passion for doing good and meaningful work would make our connection even stronger.\r\n* Love, Support & Growth - I’m seeking a relationship where we can genuinely care for and support one another. I want us to be partners in helping each other grow into our best selves, with plenty of encouragement and kindness along the way.\r\nMore Photos\r\n  \t  \r\n\r\nWelcome to More Photos…\r\n\t  Me and my girlfriend on the Brooklyn Bridge\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nMe and a friend in front of a shrimp-y column\r\n\t  Getting married!\r\n\t  Hanoi Train Street (after Asia Farm Animal Day)\r\n\t  Me and my now-husband, \r\nback when we first started dating in 2015\r\n\t  \r\nEnjoying a vegan cookie ice cream sandwich\r\n\t  In India during our team’s annual “Shrimposium” \r\n\t  \t  Getting my copy of Animal Liberation Now signed by Peter Singer!

      "fullText": "Skip to content\n❤️\nDate José\nGet Notion free\n❤️\nDate José\nI am looking for someone to date and eventually marry!\nUltimately finding someone is very simple: It’s just about being mutually attracted and excited about the possibility of building a life together (though you can also reach out for a less intense relationship!). The core requirements for that are:\nWe must be good communicators (Which in turn requires emotional competency, self-awareness, kindness, curiosity, and intelligence)\nWe must be mutually attracted (I’m straight)\nAnd we must vibe\nI hope you can judge communication from my writings and the kinds of things I do; attraction from my pictures. The vibe has to be experienced but unlike pictures, that doesn’t scale. So this document tries to convey my vibe through an explanation of my values, my life, and some anecdotes.\nMe on the internet\nShow; don’t tell, as they say:\nTwitterJosé Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente (@ArtirKel) on X​\nInstagram (@jlriconf)​\nJose Luis RiconNintil​\nAbout me\nI was born in Spain (Madrid) in 1992, then grew up in the Canary Islands to a height of 5’10’’. Eventually I went to college for too long, earning two masters degrees in mechanical engineering and aerospace dynamics.\nMy early career ambitions of doing actual rocket science got derailed by Life, and ended up in a series of jobs that started in the shop floor of an electric car company, an ended up in my current role as Head of Theory at Retro Biosciences. In between I worked at an AI startup that got acquired by Twitter and was offered a job to blog on the internet for 2 years by a bay area benefactor, which also got me my first O1 visa to come to the US. I’ve been a resident of San Francisco for 4 years and intend to continue residing in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future.\nThis is indeed my official pic from work, see it at retro.bio/team\nALT\nTo some people I’m most known as the blogger behind nintil.com, where I’ve written about all sorts of things for over a decade, from the economic history of the USSR to Alzheimer’s Disease to technological progress and metascience to AI risk. If my current life arc goes well, my next proudest achievement will be to have made a meaningful dent on human aging.\nValues\nWhat makes a person them? One could gesture at memories, the way they look, the things they like. Maybe people don’t really exist, if one has ripped deep from the Parfitian bong. I find some truth to the idea that people are to some extent their values. I definitely think so for myself: I identify with my values, the most stable part of who I am. What do you care about? How do you behave in the world? Here are my own\nTruth-seeking: I want to understand the world and those around me, including myself. This is probably the first value I ever consciously endorsed. My first answer to “what is the point of it all” was this, perhaps oddly as many people tend to reach for ‘happiness’, ‘understanding’.\nHonesty and transparency: I really try to only speak truths and to not decline questions about myself, my motivations, or my thoughts (unless there are concerns about other people’s privacy, promises I’ve made, NDAs, etc). I once stood in front of an audience exposed to arbitrary questions about what most would consider very personal matters and I answered them all.\nReliability: I do what I say. I keep my promises, am not late to things. I keep most of my tasks in my calendar and have good awareness of what’s happening and what has to happen next.\nIntegrity: I strive to be consistent in my actions across contexts. No matter what I’m doing, the same principles apply. If I’m being hypocritical I appreciate if I’m called out on it so I can be better aligned with what deep down I value.\nSelf-improvement: Though I’m pretty great, I believe I can be even better and I appreciate when others help me, even when I don’t ask for it. Unsolicited advice is hereby declared solicited!\nBenevolent perspective: Sometimes people make other people feel bad for a variety of reasons. I think people are, deep down, good. When they are not, they are mistaken in some or another way. This leads me to react with curiosity, pity, and sadness (accordingly, case by case) instead of anger and hate. I don’t always act like this for I too am a fallible human but I try! This doesn’t mean I’m naive about people. Some people can’t be trusted, they say one thing and do anther or are manipulative!\nPolitics: though I don’t think about politics that much in my day to day life, the labels libertarian, classical libertarian, or even anarchist of some flavor would fit me; you can read more in my blog about my views.\nWhat my life looks like\nI live in San Francisco and I really like the Bay Area. I don’t envision moving anywhere else, particularly as long as I work at my current job. If forced to choose another place (other than the Bay Area), that would be New York.\nI’m the Head of Theory at Retro Biosciences, a company that aims to extend healthy human lifespan by 10 years. I work on strategy and vision-setting for the whole company.\nSometimes after work I have time for some social occasions but I try to have those happening on the weekends. I have a car so nowhere in the bay feels too far.\nI go to sauna+cold plunge for ~2 hours every week to unwind and reset for the next week\nI go dancing often, either solo (ecstatic dance) or partnered (fusion dance typically). From time to time it is the case that I’m the first person starting a dance floor. I do contact improv from time to time and I wouldn’t be surprised if I get into tango at some point.\nFood remains a passion of mine, it truly is one of the existential joys in life! I like going for dinners and fine dining and occasionally cook. I started hosting dinners for friends this year and would want to host social gatherings in the future\nI am very social. There are people out there that probably think of me as their local Partiful dealer.\nI go to festivals sometimes; in 2024 I went to vibeclipse, vibecamp, and burning man\nBut I’m still an introvert at heart. I like staying in cozymaxxing, drinking tea and reading\nThis year I picked up meditation and circling and various attempts at embodiment practices. I haven’t jhana’d yet but trying!\nI do less travel than I used to but I could imagine getting back into it in the future. There is a world out there to explore!\nI work out at home. I started building a minigym in my room and would like to expand it if I had more space. Sometimes I go to more class-type workouts like Barry’s.\nI still read and write in my blog, but less than I used to. Now I do a lot of reading and writing at work so that need gets met there.\nIf I were to write a section like this 5 years ago I’d say that my life looks like working, going to nice restaurants, occasionally visiting European countries on the weekends, playing videogames, watching anime, reading, and writing in my blog and not feature much in terms of in person social activities. Maybe 5 years from now I’ll be making art, practicing BJJ, and starting my own company.\nPotential incompatibilities\nSome things that could lead to disagreements or conflicts\nI like order. Though I have gotten better at this, a space that’s messy and unkempt makes me feel bad and slightly judgmental towards whoever is responsible for that space in a “sigh ,don’t you like nice things, why are you letting entropy win, make things nice”.\nRelated to the above, as I want to keep my promises and commitments, sometimes I can’t be fully present if I know there’s something happening after the current activity. This comes handy at work (making sure a meeting doesn’t rabbithole pointlessly nor it skips agenda items) but it’s annoying when eg. cuddling (not having to think ‘have we cuddled for long enough?’ is nice). My solution to this is using timers.\nI can be stubborn sometimes. Often my view of the world is that I am right and everything I do is the correct action, with high confidence. But I also change my mind quickly. Truly strong beliefs, weakly held. I strive to not be too annoying about this. Fighting me is worth it though, as it will refine my understanding of a topic and eventually I do change my mind on things.\nMy curiosity about people can come across as judgmental. Whether you do something unusual or like vanilla ice cream, I might be asking questions of the type “why do you like that?” which can feel like I’m rejecting your experience or I’m wishing you to change. I know why I ask these questions and there is indeed a mixture of genuine curiosity and “I want you to change”\nSometimes I’m told I’m very “in my head” and “disembodied”. Trying to understand better what that means and be more of a being in the world at the moment.\nI get overwhelmed if I’m in a room with lots of conversations around me for long enough. “Wait but how are you in the top 0.1% of SF party enjoyers, you might ask” My current reconciliation of social events and this is to arrive exactly on time and leave once the noise is unbearable. So for me the peak forms of social hangouts are either small group conversations or ragers where there’s only dancing and music but not much talking.\nWhat I’m looking for\nThis is not a job description, take these as a broad direction, you don’t have to be perfect along all of these dimensions!\nAesthetics: I like nice things (art, fine dining, nicely decorated rooms, etc) and ideally you should too. But I don’t have enough taste as others do to make this happen for me. Help me make our lives beautiful, or let’s hire an interior designer to help us lol.\nGood self-aware communication. Someone that understands themselves deeply and is willing to extend that deep understanding to me. Let’s build little models of each other in our minds :)\nA growth partner: I see a relationship as something where we grow together. I’ll help you grow but won’t try to fix you and I expect you will do the same with me.\nA balanced way of being: You see the appeal of both cold and warm cultures, you can zoom into narrow problems and also take the high level view. Same for guess and ask cultures: you see the point of asking directly for what you want as well as looking out for what others might need.\nSomeone to do things together with: Anything in my list above, plus maybe something from your own list? Ultimately, with the right person, many activities can become enjoyable, from drinking tea and reading, assembling lego flowers together to going to burning man.\nMonogamish-to-poly: Reading Esther Perel left me convinced that pure monogamy is not for me (or people like me). When I think “will one person even be enough” part of me says yeah if they are the right person! Another part says probably not! But people change, and if I commit all-in to monogamy now (even with the right person) I see myself with a high enough risk of being unhappy in the future, tied by my values of honesty and commitment, so I want to leave that door open. You could be asymmetrically monogamous or you could be very poly, as long as we still are transparent with each other (per values above)\nKids. I am not yet sure if I want them. I am open to that, but not in the next 2 years. I expect I’ll end up wanting kids though.\nAssorted José facts\nI’m funny sometimes. I also say strange things that make sense at least to me. José Luis Ricón Fernández de la PuenteJosé Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente on Twitter / X​\nThere are a couple of podcasts where I yap about various topics of interest\nThe previous iteration of this date-me doc was featured in the NYT!\nI’m surprisingly good at table football (but I rarely have the chance to play)\nFor my 30th birthday I ran a small art exhibition of my greatest tweets at the SF Commons. Great cakes were procured. People don’t maxx out on good cakes enough.\nI was once invited to a conference in the US. As a visitor the TSA office asked me what brought me to the US. I said “to make science great again”. The officer lol’d and let me into the country.\nI might be the person about whom the most Manifold Markets have been made ManifoldHome​\nDiet: I eat animals sometimes (you don’t have to agree on this). That said, I don’t think one has to eat animals to be healthy, so I’m happy with being mostly vegetarian or vegan-ish at home, and spending my animal points on nicely cooked steak.\nPictures\nJose’s paella, known as SF’s best paella\nALT\nMe & my roommate Angie at the launch of Scout Dixon West’s perfumes. Angie is really based and she’ll assess your culture fit during the onsite.\nALT\nThat night I had two parties to attend; one was a Disney x 50 shades of grey, the other one a regular halloween party. I opted for a Spanish Inquisitor costume that could morph (with the hat and the mask) into Masquerade Jaffar for the second party.\nALT\nI will look at you with the same loving intensity I'm giving this teacup\nALT\nThis one could illustrate the dictionary entry for cozymaxxing couldn’t it\nALT\nBonus: pictures me pointing at things\nNext steps\nThree options await you:\nIf I’m not for you, then you you can go on with your life!\nIf you do like me and perhaps would like to date me but you are like not fully convinced or think I should be the one making the first move, then you can opt to show interest under the usual plausible deniability rules.

      "fullText": "﻿Should you date Kelechi?    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat is this? \r\nIf you didn’t land here from a Date Me directory, you might be wondering what this is. Here’s a NYT Article that explains the idea. I think of it as a custom dating profile that’s not tied to a specific app.\r\nWhat I look for in romantic relationships\r\nIntimacy — Do I feel safe with you? Do we communicate well?— 2) collaboration —  Do we get energized by similar pursuits? Do we have fun together? Do we work well together? I’m looking, in short, for a mix of a playmate, a confidante, and a collaborator. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, my significant other and I would design our lives around compelling joint adventures. Maybe we spend one week painting a mural, another two weeks figuring out how to raise chickens, then two months fixing up a RV for a cross-country road trip. To me, a life well spent is one filled with creation and worthy pursuits. A life where your experiences teach you a lot about yourself and the world, and you leave some beautiful things behind you. If you know someone who has a similar view, please share this with them. If you are that person and you’d like to meet me, fill out this form or reach out directly at knwankwoala2@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This doc is much longer than it needs to be. Don’t be threatened! Read as little or as much as you like, grabbing the parts that are most intriguing to you. No need to read everything before hitting me up. Dating is better with a bit of mystery. \r\nBasics\r\nI'm a sparsely tattooed, Nigerian-American, cis-male. I am 26 years old, 5’9”, and I live just outside New York City. I am currently working on pivoting to software engineering from marketing analytics/research. I would describe myself as an extraverted introvert NOT an introverted extravert. I'm poly-oriented but currently unpartnered. I'm like to have kids at some point, but I’m not looking to have any in the next few years. In the long term, I imagine myself living somewhere with easy access to nature and outdoor recreation. I’m not particularly tied to any place or region, though I am quite fond of New York. I don’t smoke. I drink occasionally. I imagine I lived a past life as an octopus or an orca. \r\nAbout Me\r\nCurious, Adventurous, Eclectic\r\nMy default orientation to most activities is I'm down if you're down. I tend to crave highly intense sensory experiences. Activities like sky-diving, skiing, and motorcycle riding really appeal to me, and I tend to feel most myself moving fast downhill. I'll do anything once, and I’m the kind of friend where if you do something silly, I probably will do something sillier to make you laugh. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s a short but non-exhaustive list of the kinds of things that sound fun to me but might be polarizing to others. \r\n      * Creating and maintaining an ant farm\r\n      * Beekeeping\r\n      * Learning falconry\r\n      * Building your own log cabin in the woods\r\n      * Living on a sailboat\r\n      * Doing a triathlon\r\n      * Owning ferrets\r\n      * Getting my pilot’s license\r\n      * Breaking the world record for the largest blanket fort\r\n      * Murder mystery parties\r\n      * Designing my own pants\r\n      * Screen printing shirts\r\n      * Learning to weld\r\n      * Circling\r\n      * Sensory deprivation tank\r\n      * Climbing a mountain\r\nIntellectual & Philosophical\r\nMy primary orientation to life is analytical. I desire to think clearly, and it’s important to me to be with someone who also values what I’d call “intellectual hygiene”. I want to date someone who helps me to be a better thinker and a better truthseeker. Stress test my claims; point out when I'm getting sloppy and judge me for it. Keep me accountable. I know that all sounds fairly serious, but I’m hoping that means we can discuss “big” topics in a more generative and joyful way. You can, in principle, convince me of anything.\r\nGrowth-Minded\r\nI have a healthy amount of ambition, but most of it is directed at self-improvement rather than status. I care less and less about winning a trophy and more about fostering new capabilities in myself, being able to create and do new things. My version of happiness, in short, is eudaimonia, continually striving to develop your own idiosyncratic excellence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t expect my partner to be exactly as ambitious, but I think a certain amount of restlessness will be needed. More will be appreciated. If striving disconcerts you, we may not be a good match. \r\nPlayful, Whimsical, Enthusiastic \r\nI love, love games, of pretty much all kinds. I’m not good at them, but I love them. I think there’s something about the clearly defined rules and conditions my mind likes, especially when it comes to social games like Mafia. Chess and I are well-acquainted. I’m a big fan of improv. DnD is a core passion of mine. I’m competitive in games, meaning I won’t go easy on you, but I’m collaborative too. I think I’m really good at being deadly serious about silly things. I’m decidedly at my social best in a one on one conversation or an activity based hang. \r\nQuietly Romantic, Style-Conscious, Sensitive \r\nUnlike a lot of rat/EA-adjacent folks, I’m more word-cell than shape-rotator. My mental homebase has always been the verbal, and with that comes a kind of deep, gut-feeling appreciation for style. I think what it is is that my world-building and sense-creating muscles have grown (overly?) strong over a childhood of heavy reading. My feelings are quite sensitive to ideas, and so I’ve become fascinated by how art manages to provoke those feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can always interest me in an in-depth discussion of a book, a movie, or a poem. I think it’s hot when people identify how they think the stylistic features of an art piece are or are not functioning. Some of my favorite books, The Art of Cruelty by Maggie Nelson, Touching Feeling by Eve Sedgwick, or Feel Free by Zadie Smith are just that, really detailed and thoughtful accounts of the human response to art. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of my own art practice, I write poetry from time to time and would like to eventually publish some essays and short stories. I draw at the level of a talented 13 year old. I’m not musical in any way, but I’m really into listening to it. I’ll wax poetic on MF Doom as easily as Panic! At The Disco. Fashion-wise, I have often been told I have good style, but I guess that’s up for you to decide. \r\nGrounded, Cozy, Soft, Systematic\r\nI know, I know. I’ve talked a lot about striving and adventure, but to be honest, I’m also an creature of comfort. A lot of my striving takes the form of personal projects, which I try to get  done in cozy environments — my office, a cute coffee shop, a nice library. I really like the feeling of being in a room where everything has its place. I’m particularly partial to gothic, japandi, and rustic/log cabin interior design. I’m fond of Tudor houses. \r\n\r\n\r\nI love cuddling. One of my favorite things to do is to nap in a comfortable bed with someone else. Physical touch is definitely one of my biggest love languages. \r\nMiscellaneous Info \r\nLikes\r\n* Perfectly ripe avocados\r\n* Journaling in the morning with a cup of coffee by a medium-small body of water\r\n* Adrienne Lenker lyrics\r\n* Runner’s high\r\n* When you surprise yourself using a word you just learned in a conversation\r\n* Malapropisms\r\n* Adventure Time\r\n* Fauvism\r\n* Brennan Lee Mulligan\r\n* Tabletop role playing games\r\n* Imagining the tenth dimension\r\n* The poetry of Terence Hayes\r\n* Bluets by Maggie Nelson\r\n* Etymology\r\n* Seeing a bird I've never seen before\r\n* Poussin’s paintings\r\n* Studying at research libraries like the State Library of New South Wales or The Reading Room at Brody\r\n* Formal/Genre experiments\r\n* This hotblack music video about good and evil\r\n* Short stories\r\n* The monologue at the end of Childish Gambino's Camp\r\n* The Binding of Isaac (the game, not the biblical story)\r\n* The films of Yorgos Lanthimos\r\n* Indie websites\r\n* On being the right size\r\n* Micheal Cera\r\n* Fiona Apple\r\n* Rapping the entirety of an Earl Sweatshirt verse perfectly\r\n* People Watching\r\n* The look of shaved hair on a barbershop floor\r\n* Tilda Swinton\r\n* Self-referential lists \r\nThings you would think I'd like but I somehow don't\r\n* Really big crowds\r\n* Concerts/live-music events\r\n* Zoos\r\n* Star Trek\r\n* Rock climbing (pretty neutral towards it honestly)\r\n* Letterboxd\r\n* Marvel Comics\r\n* Basketball\r\nThings you would think I don’t like but I really do\r\n* Public speaking\r\n* Carly Rae Jepsen\r\n* Celine Dion\r\n* The Sound of Music\r\n* Disney movies\r\n* McDonald’s Sausage EggMcMuffins \r\nSigns We Should Date\r\n* You have a favorite philosopher\r\n* You read Walden and thought wow I wish I could do something like that\r\n* You have good, if unfounded, feelings about 70's era hippies\r\n* You are currently reading a book \r\n* You love to discuss movies after you finish them\r\n* You like board games\r\n* Someone has accused you of having autism\r\nMy 🚩\r\n* I'm still really close with my best friend who happens to be my ex.\r\n* I tend to be pretty independent & self-centered. I can occasionally come off as cold. I’m getting better at being more proactively community/other oriented. \r\n* I'm not very conscientious at all — all of my executive functioning is hard won and I suspect they will disappoint you if you are naturally Type A\r\n* My cat sleeps in the bed with me, which I objectively think is gross but I subjectively don't want it any other way.\r\n* I can occasionally be pretty introverted. Hopefully you don't mind staying at home a couple weekends in a row? We’ll do something big to make up for it. \r\n* I have a big family and they are pretty traditional and boisterous. Even I think they can be abrasive. They mean well, though. \r\n* I sleep a lot\r\n* I’m not a great texter. Please call or email me!!\r\n* I tend towards rugged minimalism. I’m a big saver. I hate spending on frivolous things. \r\n* I’m an atheist and more intolerant than I’d like to be towards sincere believers. \r\n* I read Infinite Jest and liked it.\r\n* Big overthinker, intermittently in need of social reassurance \r\n* My humor tends to be bawdy and gross or absurdist and over-intellectual. I watched too much Adult Swim as a kid. \r\n\r\n\r\nFriend Reviews\r\n“Kelechi is the perfect balance of intellectual, witty, comical, great sex and sincere.” — My best friend/ex \r\n\r\n\r\nTBD\r\nAbout You\r\nTBD\r\nA Day in Our Life\r\nTBD\r\nCall to Action\r\nAfter reading all that, if you think we could be a good match (or you have a friend who might be), fill out my form, email me at knwankwoala2@gmail.com, walk up to me on the street and say “Come with me, Mr. President”, throw pebbles at my window, write me a poem, or send me a document like this of your own! (If you're not sure what to say, tell me about a favorite book or a thought that’s been on your mind.) If you’re uncertain, err on the side of getting in touch. I would say I don’t bite, but I do. ;)"

      "fullText": "﻿Daniel Filan’s date-me doc\r\n  \r\nLast edited 2025-10-12, best viewed on desktop\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! I’m Daniel Filan! Here are some basic things about me:\r\n* Man\r\n* 5’8”, ~145 lb\r\n* Born March 1994\r\n* Berkeley, CA\r\n* Poly\r\nI’m looking for\r\n* A woman\r\n* … to (eventually) be in a committed relationship with\r\n* … that ideally leads to having kids.\r\nInterested? Email df@danielfilan.com, or reach out some other way (e.g. via twitter). Want to know more? Read on.\r\nWhat I’m like\r\nI work in the field of AI research—specifically, research that aims to reduce the chance that AI takes over the world. At the moment I’m helping run a research internship program, managing the interns and other people who manage the interns. I also make a podcast where I interview people in the field about their research.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, my main hobby is learning Latin. Other present and past hobbies include contra dancing, learning about the history of Christianity, and watching anime. I also try to do cardio exercise at least three times a week, and enjoy taking long walks (I recently walked 17 miles diagonally across San Francisco).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had to describe my general vibe, I would say that I’m academic-shaped. The thing I am best at is studying, and if I may flatter myself, I think I would make a good 60-year-old whose job was to be generally erudite and warm.\r\nTestimonials\r\nI’m bad at describing myself, so here are some friends’ descriptions of me:\r\n\r\n\r\nAsya Bergal (excerpts below, full testimonial here, bolding original):\r\nDaniel is very (intentionally) funny, at least to me and a lot of people whose sense of humor isn’t too far from mine. IMO the best thing about Daniel is a mixture of being generative, funny, and low-ego that reliably makes me joyful (often laughing) and at ease when I’m around him. I think he fosters this feeling to a really unusual extent among people I know, and I suspect the optimal long-term partner for   Daniel will be someone who really likes that feeling and wants to live in it forever.\r\n* [...] several individuals from different parts of my social network have unpromptedly expressed to me that they find Daniel very good to be around, including one who I think of as extremely judgmental and perceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEli Tyre:\r\nDaniel Filan is among the top 10 highest integrity people that I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:\r\nDaniel is interesting to talk to, he knows many things. I usually get a bit anxious around new people but did not feel that way when talking to Daniel - he seems nonjudgmental and is also occasionally funny :p\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Steidley:\r\nDaniel is a fantastically passionate guy. He’s always interested in some new topic and learning everything about it. He’s funny. He’s cheerful. He’s a delight. It’s extremely rare to find him in a bad mood. \r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel stands up for what he believes in, but also admits his mistakes quickly and completely. He’s terrifically smart.\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nAt a high level: intimate, reliable, and comfortable companionship that helps me grow in unexpected ways and can serve as a foundation for the rest of my life. But I think that’s pretty generic. So here are traits someone could have that I think predict I would get on well with them:\r\n* Being analytical\r\n* Being ambitious but also (at least somewhat) pro-social\r\n* Being curious and open-minded\r\n* Favouring bluntness and honesty, while trying to maintain tact\r\nCompatibility\r\nHere are some things about me that will maybe help you predict whether we’re compatible. Note that apart from location + children, these aren’t asks of you, they’re facts about me.\r\n* As mentioned above, I think I want kids. I’m not dead set on them, but they seem pretty cool, and in general I’ve observed that my positive affect towards babies and children has grown a lot in the past 5 or so years.\r\n* I live in the SF Bay Area. Moving for a relationship is not totally out of the question, but the bar for doing so is quite high.\r\n* I’m currently in a polyamorous relationship that I like with someone who is not currently interested in having children. Due to wanting children, I’m looking for another partner to be in a primary/committed role with.\r\n   * I don’t have much experience with polyamory, and so don’t feel very settled in a poly ‘style’ and could imagine changing what I want things to look like.\r\n* I’m asexual. I enjoy physical contact, but having sex doesn’t feel desirable to me.\r\n* I’m vegan, and disapprove of the consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy. I’m OK with being close with people who aren’t vegan, but I could imagine tension about how to raise any children, or if you think that non-human animal welfare obviously doesn’t matter.\r\n* I don’t really drink alcohol or take other recreational intoxicants (which is to say: I do such things less than once a month, but not never).\r\n* I am very politically libertarian.\r\n* I’m active in the LessWrong and Effective Altruism communities, altho I would say I’m more of a LessWronger than an Effective Altruist.\r\n* I sneeze extremely loudly—loud enough that I have one friend who is genuinely seriously bothered by it (but not so loud that I have more than one such friend (well, as far as I know)).\r\n   * If you don’t have misophonia, I think this will probably not be a deal-breaker.\r\n* I don’t believe in God. I’m interested in the phenomenon of religion, but don’t recommend practicing it.\r\nMore photos of me\r\n  \r\n I am normal and can be trusted with babies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘Fun’ facts about me\r\n* I grew up in Australia. My accent is predominantly general American, but retains a few Australian characteristics (e.g. the way I say “no”).\r\n* The caption on the previous page, while funny, is literally true: I am extremely bad at purposely smiling in photos.\r\n   * I’ve been told that when I smile in real life, I smile like Keira Knightley.\r\n* I can, in my head, approximately calculate the factorials of large numbers, but it takes me an unimpressive amount of time.\r\n   * You can too by memorizing Stirling’s approximation and a few base-ten logarithms.\r\n* Wiktionary uses a sentence I originally wrote (but did not add there) to illustrate the use of the word “scrutable”.\r\n* I came up with what I believe is the worst unparalleled misalignment yet found—specifically, it was used by the creator of the art form as an example of the epitome of un-funniness and torturedness.\r\n   * It’s Los Angeles // newspaper comics.\r\n* The reason I got around to actually writing this date me doc is that I told someone I would pay them $200 if I didn’t publish one by a certain date. The reason I did that is that I told the same person I would pay them $100 if, by a certain date, I didn’t arrange to make a deal to pay them >$100 if I didn’t publish a date-me doc by a     certain date."

I live in Brooklyn, NYC. I’m playful, reflective, and caring; I’m Uncle Hussein and godparent to two kids I love, I have an amazing cat, I do community work, etc; just a normal, stand-up guy with zero skeletons in the closet and absolutely no aspirations to start a personality cult or anything weird like that.\nThe sort of person I am\nOn bad days I think I’m a good person because I’m funny and clever.\nOn good days I think I’m a good person because I’m open-hearted, playful, and kind.\nOn the best days I don’t think about whether I’m a good person at all.\nI recently combined a list of goals and the things I like to do, and they seemed to fall into four values: connection, curiosity, beauty, and vitality.\nIf you are sick I will make soup and bring it to you. It’s an important way I show love.\nSome things I like to do:\nDance, in particular 5Rhythms (free movement / expressive / ecstatic dance);\nOutdoorsy / light-active stuff: climbing, walking, fair-weather sailing, easy cycling (no lycra);\nGrow food - I built raised beds in my garden, and love the fresh tomatoes I get from it;\nDIY and making stuff - I’ve made plenty of the things in my house, including furniture and drapery;\nCooking, restaurants, cocktails (though I rarely drink these days);\nAny classical music concert featuring an angsty Russian Romantic composer;\nI worked in tech for 15+ years and one thing it is easy to do is separate oneself from people unlike you. To work and live and play in communities of people very similar to you, or to have the “diversity” you experience look like skin color and sexuality and gender id but not wealth or class or education. It is deeply, vitally important to me to\nnot\ndo this, to stay connected to and in touch and aware of the way others live. We may be better off but we are not better. I will not separate myself from humanity.\nMy vice is hookah. If I had one at home I’d instantly die of lung cancer, so I don’t. But I keep finding that the best people I know are down to go to a hookah bar. Doesn’t have to be you, but it’s an easy way to get a 🤩 face from me.\nI want one of these. This one is someone else's, but I love her anyway.\nThe sort of future I want\nI believe a life of weeping-with-happiness contentment is possible, and I want it.\n[Update: since writing that, I have wept with happiness.]\nI would like to co-create a life - location, partner, friends, community (which I see as another word for “family”) - at a more sustainable pace, where exploration and flourishing is nurtured. I value making sure people are fed: I’ve volunteered making meals for chronically sick people, and also helped run a mutual aid food drive for two years. I want to spend more of my time tackling food insecurity and I’ve got Big Plans to do so.\nI’ve still got more travelling in me: more time in Japan, interior China, a return to Istanbul, and Iran are all on my bucket list. I seem to be converging on India from both directions.\nSomeone giving me feedback on this page once told me I come across as having main character energy. It’s true! And I’m looking for a co-star: someone who burns brightly, knows it, and wants to be with me because they love my light; a relationship where we reinforce and lift each other, ever-growing.\nI think I’d make an amazing trophy husband, which is only a joke if you’re not rich.\nI want children, and I want to be active in raising them. I grew up in London and miss it enormously, but it’s not time for me to move back\nyet\n; but I do think it’d be a wonderful place to live it’s time for me to trade my main character energy into being a supporting character in my kids’ lives. If we get serious, expect me to seriously float this idea. In the meantime, I’ll be back for regular visits: London is a place where I breathe out, find ease and peace.\nSpirituality\nI used to be allergic to the word until a friend pointed out “dude, you have a spirit, it’s the thing that makes you you”, and then I was fine.\nThe condensed version of my spiritual biography: I grew up Muslim, but quit in my early twenties because I felt like I couldn’t do it well enough. I came close to falling down the New Atheism rabbithole, but dodged it; in my late twenties I began a quest for capital-M Meaning, which I finally found after lots of therapy and years of Zen practice.\nBuddhism has been important to me for approaching a decade. Buddhist philosophy and psychology is very much a part of who I am, how I think, and how I like to relate to the world. An example: when getting US citizenship, I asked for a waiver to the Oath of Allegiance on the grounds of not wanting to support the military, even though being 38 means there’s basically no chance I’ll get drafted.\nIt’s important to me that my partner has their own self-development practice - something that helps them be freer, kinder, and more open. It by no means has to be Buddhist flavoured.\nPotential dealbreakers\nI’m happy to talk about any of these if you’d like to know more.\nI would like to have children (at least one), preferably biological.\nThe kind of relationship I want is rock-solid: lots of communication, exquisite attunement. I think such a relationship could unfold into something monogam\nish\n: if there is nothing that can threaten the relationship, there’s room for fun and sparkles. But to say that the relationship needs to feel very secure first is an understatement; getting that right is the only priority.\nI pair better with someone who also has good executive function skills. Being able to trust a partner to get things done makes me feel taken care of, and gives me a profound feeling of relief and safety.\nI am politically far to the left. That said, I have largely disengaged with US politics and treat it solely as a spectacle. These days I am more of an anarchist, by which I mean I believe that community building and mutual aid is worthwhile and morally necessary.\nIf you think Israel’s occupation and treatment of Palestine is in any way conscionable or justifiable, I am not the person for you.\nI’m an only child, and have minimal to no contact with both of my parents. My family is thus entirely chosen. If you’re close to yours, I would love to become part of it.\nI have\na (really, really, really amazing) cat\n. If you viscerally hate cats, or have overwhelming allergies, that’d make it hard.\nI am vegetarian, with very occasional and intentional exceptions. I don’t mind whether you are or not. I do enjoy cooking, and will want to cook for you, so if you’ll feel slighted by me not putting meat on your plate then… eh, I dunno.\nWhat next?\nThis is the end of the text-heavy part. Thank you for sticking around!\nThere are a few places you can go from here:\nLook at\npictures of my cat\nLook at\nan assortment of pictures and videos from my life\nIf you’re interested, or have something to say, email me:\nhello@thiswebsite\nThanks, and I hope you find what you’re looking for too. ❤\n[back to top]\nMade with\nGitHub Pages\nand\nReverie"

      "fullText": "﻿Date me[1] 🦝\r\n\r\n\r\nVersión en español\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick details & trivia\r\nAge: 34\r\nLocation: Barcelona, Spain\r\nLooking for: a relationship based on mutual compatibility and connection (with man or woman)\r\nPersonality type (Myers-Briggs): INFP-T\r\nZodiac sign: Virgo\r\nFavorite dish: chicken curry\r\nFavorite movie: Pocahontas\r\nFavorite series: Sense8 & Game of Thrones\r\nBest thing about me: I have empathy and care about others\r\nWorst thing about me: I am always hesitant and scared of making mistakes so I end up not doing many things that I’d like to do\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nHello, (whoever is reading this)!👋 I am an introverted and shy girl trying to meet new people over here. I generally have a hard time starting off conversations, but I can be friendly and nice once I manage to get over the initial awkwardness. I appreciate quality time spent together, deep conversations and shared laughter, especially if they are over a cup of tea or good food. \r\nI decided to create this file because the idea of Date Me Docs seemed old-schoolish in a cute, nerdy way (in other words, quite appealing, especially in contrast to the shallowness of dating apps). Why not? Maybe the right person for me might be out there reading this doc right now. \r\nHere are some random facts you may want to know about me:\r\n* I am a bit childish: I use colorful fineliners when I write in hand and add many emojis when I type; and I like doing stuff like watching animated movies, singing karaoke and wearing costumes on Carnival 🤪\r\n* I am in the autism spectrum (feel free to ask if you want to know more).\r\n* I have a driving license but it’s been years since I last drove a car.\r\n* I struggle with time management, but I hate it when someone is late.\r\n* I have moved 5 times over the last 6-7 years.\r\n* I can say “I love you” in 18 different languages 😏\r\n* I LOVE eating ramen and sushi (in case you don’t have any date ideas… 🤭)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy no picture?\r\nTwo words: privacy concerns. I do not feel very keen on the idea of my picture being available online for anyone to see. However, I will be happy to share my picture with you privately if you reach me out. For now, I can broadly say that I am Caucasian, a brunette, small-sized (short and thin) and that I wear glasses. So I would look something (very approximately) like this avatar:\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hobbies\r\n* Books. I love reading and immersing myself in a good story. I wouldn’t say that I stick to a particular genre, but I like historical fiction and fantasy most of all. Just let me know if you want any recommendations 😉\r\n* Languages. Apart from English, I can speak Catalan, Spanish and Russian. Now I am learning Turkish too and I also have some basic knowledge of Hindi and Italian. So if you speak any of these languages, we might as well have a language exchange 😉\r\n* Movies. Yes, I know, that’s typical, but who doesn’t love lying on the sofa with a blanket and watching a good (or not so good) movie? Btw, Disney/Pixar movies are among my favorites 😊\r\n* Going to the theater, museums… anything cultural.\r\n*  Writing. I am not going to share my texts with anyone for now, but I can say I am working on a historical-romantic novel that might (or might not) be completed some day.\r\n* Traveling. Yes, I know this is controversial and I myself have some mixed feelings about this one because of how everything nowadays seems to revolve around taking selfies and posting how cool you are on Instagram. However, I still like to explore different places and cultures, and it would be great if we could have that passion in common. Some countries on my bucket list: Laos, Cambodia, Morocco, Iceland, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Peru, Bolivia, Uzbekistan 😏\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nEssentially, I’m looking for someone I can have a mid-to-long-term, caring and nurturing relationship with. I am not interested in long-distance, open or polyamorous relationships (yup, I am a traditional girl), so we might not be well-suited for each other if you don’t live close to Barcelona or are looking for that kind of thing.\r\nWhat I ask for in a partner:\r\n\r\n1. You must be an honest, humble and wholesome person. Yes, that is a strict must, but I think it’s the bare minimum you can ask from a human being.\r\n2. Having an open mind. While I have my own political views and values, and it would be great if we align on those, we will not always agree on everything, and that is perfectly fine as long as we respect each other’s views. Of course, I draw the line at homophobia, racism, fascism and any sort of bigotry or discrimination.\r\n3. Being independent. And by that I mean that both you and I can make plans on our own (we do not have to always do everything together) and that you are able to make your own decisions and have your own thoughts besides what your friends, parents, etc. might tell you. Oh, and being able to do basic tasks like doing laundry, washing dishes or making a simple meal.\r\n4. Having some sort of intellectual curiosity. I am generally a quiet person, but I do like to talk about things I’m interested in and to have deep conversations about life, society, geopolitics, psychology, etc. And if you have a particular hobby or interest or enjoy a specific activity, please do share it with me! I love learning new things 😊\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I value in a relationship\r\nI strongly believe that you need to be (best) friends with the person you’re dating. While attraction is a necessary ingredient in a relationship, especially at the beginning, I would never consider dating someone I don’t trust or someone who is not genuinely interested in hearing how my day went. So… let’s build that trust and that connection together, shall we?\r\nIf you feel like talking to me, you can drop me a line either on my email, Facebook or Telegram.\r\n________________\r\n[1] Only if you want, of course!"

Now, I’m a research scientist on\nGoogle DeepMind’s\nscalable alignment team in San Francisco. In this document, I’ll overview what the intervening time has made of me, as a person.\nI’m hoping to meet a wonderful woman to be\nmy best fr\niend\nfor many years.\n(And by “best friend”, I mean “wife.”)\nAbout me\nI’m kind, conscientious, and ready to admit mistakes—maybe I’m\ntoo\nready, to be honest! Speaking of “honest”, I’m also an extremely honest person. I haven’t always lived as ethically or as honestly as I would now have preferred, and I’m surely going to make more mistakes, but\ngod damn\nif I’m not going to live this one life well.\nI am pretty goofy if I trust and feel comfy around someone. I think I’d jive well with someone more spontaneous and daring, since I tend to be more planned and conservative. Well, I’m\nusually\nmore conservative:\nIf I make a commitment to you, I keep it, and I’m not particularly afraid of commitments. I’m someone you can rely on.\n1\nOne of my friends described me as “not the kind of person who will put up with [unethical] conspiracies.”\nAt my thesis defense in 2022.\nOn the other hand, I do love a good\nethical\nconspiracy. I once hatched an elaborate “welcome back” party for a partner who was coming back from overseas. I rounded up 18 of her friends and hid them in my apartment so they could all jump out at her.\nProfessional life\nI’m hard-working. In 2017, in the second year of\nmy computer science\nPhD,\nI found out about the\nAI alignment prob\nlem.\nHowever, I lacked the skills to contribute to this hilariously neglected super-problem. That lack didn’t really matter to me—I thought that the world needed something from me, and I wasn’t going to\nnot even try\n.\nI might not be good at something at first, but I don’t quit! In the second year of my PhD I wasn’t comfortable proving mathematical theorems. By the end of my fourth year, I had proved 281 new theorems.\nPersonal life\nHawaiian waterfalls! 🏝️\nThat said, I’ve become a bit less research-focused recently. Somewhat relatedly, I’d become somewhat more anxious than I’d like. At the end of 2023, I realized that I just… wasn’t enjoying my life? Since then, I’ve focused on meditation, intentionality, gratitude, and actually taking breaks.\nWhen I was younger, I wasn’t social. These days, I love meeting new people! I’m an\nambivert\n: sometimes socializing is energizing, but sometimes it’s draining. I have a lot of friends who are precious to me, and I wish I could give each of them the time they each deserve. Sometimes I even look out over a city and wonder at the residents:\nPart of me wishes I could meet and deeply understand each and every person here. Each pinpoint of light is shining for a\nreason\n, it was put there\nby another person\n.\nSo, I care a lot about people—both in the abstract and personally. I’ve never yelled at anyone in my life (except, you know, I probably did as a young kid, but I don’t remember that well).  I’m also a vegan who cares about animals.\nWhat I like doing\nI like doing a lot of things!\nDancing\nI like salsa and waltz. I’m learning West Coast Swing. I can vibe with almost anything, though!\nAI-fueled house parties\nI like bringing a ton of my friends together in my\n2br\napartment. To commemorate such an occasion, I personalize a name tag for each of them! The tag has their name and then a picture of them. Only, the picture is tailored to the theme of the party:\nThe\ngigachad\nhouse party\n: MidJourney v3 interpolating my image with gigachad’s in order to create a “gigachad Alex” to go on the name tag.\n(a) Alex\n(b) Gigachad\n(c) Gigachad Alex\nThe\nhouse\nhouse party\n: Each of my friends has their own spirit and vibe! I made them houses which capture their\nessences\n.\n(a) Tolkienesque\n(b) Grimdark\n(c) Mario\nDesign & art\nI\ndesigned this webs\nite,\nfor example!\nWhile I don’t draw anymore, I’ve really gone through phases here! For example, in order to communicate research insights which were dear to me, I wrote and illustrated a series of blog posts called\nReframing Imp\nact:\nWriting\nMeditation\nI used to say “no, isn’t this just learning how to wirehead and evoke fake happiness for no reason?”. Then I got really, really sad, so I said “screw it.” I made the right choice, though I’m still not particularly skilled.\nReading textbooks\nYes\nthis\nis\na\nreal\nt\nhing\nI\ndo\nfor\nfun\nsometi\nmes.\nHow compatible are we?\nPossible dealbreakers\nI probably (70%) will want kids within the next 5 years.\nI’ve historically been polyamorous but I’m open to monogamy. I find it natural to form romantic attachments with multiple people and am not very jealous. I talk regularly with my former partner Emma—I want my friendship with her to stay strong.\nI currently live in Berkeley. I’m open to (but disprefer) a long-distance relationship if there’s a good chance we end up in the same location, assuming the relationship is great! In particular, cities like New York and London are more workable (as DeepMind has offices there I could work out of).\nWhat I’m like in a relationship\nI’m a positive presence. When my friends self-deprecate, I often scold them for insulting my friend (i.e. themselves).\nAs of November 2024, my\nattachment s\ntyle\nleans “anxious-preoccupied.” However, over the past few years, my style was “secure.” I find it easy to date anxious folks because I like supporting my partners through reassurance and praise.\nMy\nlove lang\nuage\nis “quality time” and “physical touch”, closely followed by “words of affirmation.” I want to find a life\npartner\n—a mutually supportive and committed relationship. I want to do things together.\nWhat I appreciate in a partner\nThis isn’t a list of\ndemands\nor anything, just ingredients for a good relationship with me:\nTrustworthiness, high empathy, and emotional maturity\nIntellect / wits / sharpness\nWe can talk for hours about nothing\nConfidence is hot\nBeing good at\nstem\nis also hot\nNon-avoidant attachment style\nThe kind of girl\n2\nwho would have refused to obey in\nthe Milgram experi\nment\nSpontaneous and medium-adventurous, but not to the point where you’re trying to backflip out of a plane while naked even though it’s 10:30 p.m. and we have an early morning the next day…\nSome dispositional\nje ne sais quoi\nwhich makes me feel at ease.\nIf this sounds like a nice potential connection, I’d love to:\nTake you dancing\n, or\nSpend a lazy Sunday morning watching the stream run by the\nHidden Café,\nor\nHave a sunset picnic and eat blueberries.\nThis could be us!\nOK, I’ve written enough! Get to know me if you want to know more.\nLet’s get in touch?\n☙\n❧\nFootnotes\nI mean, I’m not\nperfectly\nreliable. I’m just a hum—I mean, I’m just a trout! For example, there recently was a situation where I may have simply forgotten what someone had requested two years prior. But I think I am overall highly reliable—both in terms of faithfulness and in terms of logistics.\n⤴\nAka\n, ethical in the “I’ll actually stand up in real life” way and not just ethical in the “I’ll talk for hours about the nature of goodness” way.\n⤴"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi there,\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the basics: I’m Arun. 31 years old, living in India, and by day, I’m the person behind the Instagram posts and Facebook ads for a school. It’s a job that lets me play with colors, stories, and the occasional dad joke though I’m slowly learning to trade pixels for words. Not the flashy kind, but the ones that linger, like the last line of a poem you can’t forget.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m a lot like my favorite comfort food: dal rice. Simple, warm, maybe a little unassuming at first glance. But stick around, and you’ll find tiny surprises a crackle of cumin, a hint of ginger the kind of details that make you smile when you notice them. Mornings here are slow, evenings quieter still. You’ll often find me tucked into a corner with a book, rewatching that scene in One Piece where Luffy sets fire to the World Government’s flag (you know the one), or knitting a muffler I’ll probably gift to someone before winter ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve never been the loudest voice in the room. Grief has a way of teaching you the weight of silence, and I’ve learned to carry mine gently. But if you let me, I’ll listen to your stories, your fears, the way you take your coffee. (Yes, I’ll remember it. Even if you don’t.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy heart lives in stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaruki Murakami’s worlds, where loneliness feels like an old friend. The dog eared pages of library books, where strangers leave fragments of themselves in underlined sentences. I’m even writing my own novel In the Quiet of Words about two people who fall in love through notes tucked between chapters. It’s bittersweet, like most things I adore.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnime? Oh, absolutely. Give me a character with scars and a stubborn heart (20th Century Boys, anyone?), and I’ll give you a 2 AM essay on why their journey matters. And don’t get me started on Made in Abyss its beauty and brutality wreck me every time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I’m not lost in fiction, I’m knitting. It started as therapy, really. Just me, some yarn, and a podcast murmuring in the background. Now, every stitch feels like a prayer for peace, for patience, for the friend who’ll wear the lopsided scarf I made.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, and I cook. Nothing fancy, just soul food. A good dal rice, shared under a ceiling fan’s lazy whir, is my love language.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork? It’s a dance of spreadsheets and creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m building something meaningful at the school crafting stories that connect with parents, students, dreamers. Someday, I’d love to lead a tiny team of big hearted weirdos who believe marketing can be kind and clever.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut my secret ambition? To write. Not for clicks, but for the quiet hearts who find solace in sentences. My novel’s a mosaic of all I’ve felt love that aches, loss that lingers, and the stubborn hope that broken things still glow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who sees the world softly the way rain taps a rhythm on windows, how old Hindi comedies (Hera Pheri, hello!) can make you snort laugh even when the jokes shouldn’t land. Someone who’s okay with slow dances, deep talks, and silences that don’t need filling.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to love Murakami or anime (though I’ll geek out if you do). Just bring curiosity, kindness, and a heart that believes libraries are the closest thing to magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom confessions:\r\n\r\n\r\nI cried once while knitting. The “why” is a story I’ll tell you over chai.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ll pack snacks for our trips sweet, salty, and a charger for your dying phone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy idea of romance? Leaving a book on your desk because a paragraph made me think of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any of this resonates, let’s swap stories. I’ll bring the dal rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n— Arun\r\n\r\n\r\n(P.S. If you read this far, tell me your favorite comfort food. I’m taking notes.)"

I love `vpternlog` and `vgf2p8affineqb`.\r\n* Location: Vancouver WA/Portland Oregon, but long term flexible, preferably west coast\r\n* 28 years old, 5ft 9in/175cm, 135lb/60kg.\r\n* Affiliations with which I probably have disagreements, but are likely still useful to understand me: Effective Altruism, LessWrong, Rationalist, SSC/ACX, Episcopalian flavored atheist, Biocosmist-immortalism \r\n* Hobbies: reading, writing, cooking, wood working, photography, walking in the forest\r\n* Media: Mushishi, Haibane Renmei, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou, Nichijou, Madoka, To the Stars, Planecrash, HPMoR, Unsong\r\n* Enjoys snuggles, long walks in the forest, and long intellectual discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up in a house with a few thousand books in a forest. My parents mostly home schooled me, and I read inordinate quantities of books growing up. Having spent the last ~decade of my life focused on career advancement and saving money, I am now in a position to turn my attention to the next few decades/remainder of my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy cooking, and will happily make you good food. While I am reluctant to be strictly vegan due to health concerns, I am happy to optimize in an animal suffering reducing direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in a long term monogom-ish relationship, but am poly compatible if needed. Given an interest in, and non-zero hope of, living to see the sun burn down, I am somewhat reluctant to commit to anything for the rest of my life, but for the right person, I would be happy to commit to stay together for the next 100 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested in raising children\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren are important. I think my parents did a good job of raising me, but I want to do even better. If we end up having children, I strongly want to be a ~full time parent for at least the first ~decade of my children's life. While I am undecided on exact optimal schooling arrangement, I do feel strongly that pure public school is significantly sub-optimal.\r\nRetroactive matchmaking reward (If you yourself are not interested in dating me, but know someone who you think would be a good fit for me):\r\nI place significant value on a long term stable relationship. If I end up in a multi-year close romantic relationship primarily as a result of your intervention, I will pay you no less than $10,000. (Likely more, depending on details.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\n* Enjoys cuddling and long intellectual conversations\r\n* Wants to make the world a better place\r\n* Is OK listening to occasional info dumps about cool things I am learning\r\n* Likes to infodump about the cool things you are learning\r\n* Is interested in spending a significant part of the next few decades raising children together with me, and trying to make the world better in whatever small ways we can.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think you may be a good match, wish to introduce a potential match, or want to talk for some other reason, please feel free to contact me. I expect to respond within 3 days. If I have not, please feel free to resend or try another channel.\r\n* email: am8ryllis@gmail.com\r\n* Discord: @am8ryllis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nEndorsements (from https://manifold.love/Amaryllis )\r\nWithODEConstraints:\r\nTechnically minded and can smile incredibly brightly when caught off guard by a genuine compliment. She has cute custom cat ears.\r\nIzzy (former girlfriend):\r\nThis is my girlfriend who I love very much! She is a very good listener, very non judgmental and open minded, and is overall a very unique and cool person.\r\nAlyssa (former girlfriend):\r\nHas lots of cool projects-in-progress in lots of interesting domains, including but not limited to code-related ones, and pretty consistently happy to infodump about them. Cooks good food. Has read and watched lots of interesting books and anime, and fun to chat with about those. Good at rubber-ducking when pursuing projects of my own. In general, is both enjoyable and ~productive to interact with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information and pictures:\r\nFirst date options:\r\n* Go for a walk in a park together\r\n* Visit my place and I cook you tasty food.\r\n* Visit your place and you cook whatever food you like. (I will eat most anything.)\r\n* Hike in the forest together\r\n* Ride segways together around the local park\r\n* Watch some mutually enjoyable film together.\r\n* Probably a variety of other mutually enjoyable activities!\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe cat ears are optional, but I am quite fond of goats."

A connection wherein both parties are committed to growth and practicing the art of love on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have periodically taken career breaks to globe-trot and spend time in awe-inspiring natural landscapes; and would love to continue to do so with my mate. This would require that you be in a similarly financially stable position as me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you give my brain a boner, the rest of my body can follow. Hit me up if you wanna skip the small talk[2] in favor of meaningful conversations on the trail, at the beach, or in bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour character matters to me. Your height genuinely doesn’t.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact Me\r\nIf you’re thinking to yourself, “I bet the most direct way to get into her pants is by filling out a form,” then you’re damn right.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could probably beat you at\r\nPun competitions\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 things I could never do without\r\n1. Snuggles! Preferably with humans and doggos, but a highly affectionate cat will do in a pinch 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nIf I were a cephalopod, I'd be a cuddle-fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Feeling wonderment and smallness in gorgeous natural settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Vegan meals. A way to my heart and other parts is through my belly. (You don’t necessarily have to be vegan yourself, though.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Laughing so hard it starts to hurt, and inducing said laughter in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy underground improv performance at BART Basel\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The pursuit of self-improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The type of intimate connection wherein one feels fully seen, valued, appreciated, held, and empowered to become the best version of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing people notice about me\r\nI’m a total nerd. And a total dork. And totally love it.\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can call me Babe-raham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nA day in our life\r\nNote: While this is cribbed from my days right now, I'm very much interested in collaborating with my partner, and would love your input on what you'd like our life together to look like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaking up to you caressing my body. Time and space seem to disappear as our bodies entwine; there’s only us; our souls dancing together in the ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an ongoing competition between us of who can make the other laugh harder. I thought I'd already defeated you before we even started making breakfast, but by the end of the meal we’re clearly tied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopping in the car to hit the trailhead. You start playing a lecture from one of The Great Courses, and I periodically pause the recording to discuss what we’re learning together.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting up with our friends for a hike through a beautiful location. You’ve brought gloves for everyone so we can pick up litter we spot along the trail. We take goofy pictures. The group conversations alternate between being silly/funny and profound/vulnerable/informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining our friends for an epic post-hike meal. Food always tastes better when shared and after your body has worked for it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHeading home for a quick rinse/make out session in the shower before we split up to do our own thing for the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nI eventually head back into our bedroom for my nightly wind-down ritual of putting my phone to bed, silently reading, writing in my journal, meditating, brushing my teeth, and changing into cozy pajamas.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually you wrap up whatever cool thing you were doing and crawl into bed as well, and we snuggle while exchanging gratitudes and setting intentions for the next day. As we drift off to sleep our limbs are once again interdigitated, and the world feels like a calm and serene and lovely place.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I could also be open to a polyamorous lifestyle, but am not looking to date poly men who already have primary partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Let's instead talk about: relationship goals, commitments, how to better the world, passions, philosophies, lies we’ve told, science, psychology, the quantified self, enlightenment, paradoxes, projects we could work on together, embarrassing stories, epiphanies, bucket list items, lessons learned from previous relationships and other experiences, patriarchy, your personal definition of \"god\", economics, culture, why you're optimistic about the future, hermeneutics, animal intelligence, history, escaping the rat race, traditions, the most impactful book you've ever read, role models, habits, the awe of the cosmos, the awe of humanity’s place within the cosmos, rituals, friendships, altered states, sexuality, what makes you want to jump out of bed in the morning and take on the day, consciousness, social cohesion, anything in my profile, anything in your profile, and whatever else fascinates us."

      "fullText": "﻿Date Charlie  \r\nHey, thanks for stopping by! I’m Charlie, and I’m looking for a deep connection with a man, hopefully in the Bay Area, with an eye to finding my life partner. If you’re interested, please reach out! You can message me, get a mutual friend to intro us, email me, or use this link. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nI come across as perceptive, caring, attuned, ambitious, and sincere. \r\nHere’s how some of my friends describe me:\r\nSasha Chapin: “I think of Charlie as a graceful mover, both in physical space and in conversational space — he is a striking presence that improves the energy of a room.”\r\nCatherio: “Perceptive, caring, attuned.”\r\nMax Heitmann (ex-bf): “Charlie is his own person, probably the most himself of anyone I know. That person is sincere, curious, determined, and loving.”\r\nNora Ammann: “Charlie is thoughtful, caring and attuned, as well as spirited, curious and courageous. He is a good and loyal friend.”\r\nJohn Salvatier: “Unrelentingly present.”\r\n  \r\n\r\nRelationship style\r\nI lean monogamous, though I have a few years of experience with poly / open relationships, which I’m open to exploring with the right person. I think I’ll want children in the future, but likely not within the next 5 years.\r\nInterests\r\nI spend a significant part of my life on self-discovery, introspecting, and deepening my relationships with others. I did some Serious Meditation a few years back, and had some profound experiences. I now spend a good chunk of my time on relational practices—which often looks like having very present, authentic, conversations. Relational practices bring more truth and love to my relationships and my self-expression, and nourish me massively. \r\n  \r\n\r\nI like running events! I host dance parties and run regular relational practices; I’ve run a Relateful (circling) immersion with Jordan Allen, a Coherence Psychology retreat with Malcolm Ocean, and many CFAR and CFAR-adjacent workshops. \r\nBesides that, I love to dance west coast swing (see me dancing here), lift heavy things with perfect form (see me lifting here), hang out with my friends’ kids, and cry at Jacob Collier videos.\r\nCareer stuff: I’m Chief of Staff at Palisade Research, where we’re trying to build awareness of AI risks among policymakers. Previously, I worked as an instructor for the Center For Applied Rationality. And before that, I did a master’s at Oxford, and developed Bayesian ML models to estimate the effectiveness of interventions against COVID. Tyler Cowen described my paper as ‘The best mask-wearing study so far?’.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nI’m usually more attracted to people who are more:\r\n* Emotionally attuned: You’re in touch with yourself and listen deeply to others. You care a lot about communicating authentically.\r\n* Vibrantly interested in stuff: You’re intellectually lively, sharp/analytical, and curious. \r\n* Extroverted / energetic.\r\n* Playful!\r\n* Grounded: You’re steady in yourself, and in touch with your masculine energy.\r\n* Cute / sweet.\r\nAbout us\r\nSpending time with each other nourishes us, brings us closer to ourselves, and reminds us what life is about. \r\nI’d be especially happy if our relationship had:\r\n* Deep listening. Over time, we come to know each other, and how we relate to one another, more and more deeply. \r\n* Alive, attuned, and perhaps wildly kinky, sex (I’m switch). Also, attuned touch; cuddling.\r\n* We’re entangled with what matters most to each of us. We mutually support each other’s interests, and sometimes even participate / collaborate / build together.\r\n* Fun: We go on adventures, nature or otherwise. We share music. We dance together, messy and silly, gentle and sensual. We play. We laugh lots. We cuddle up with an excellent movie or a trashy TV show.\r\nIf you’re interested, please reach out! You can message me, get a mutual friend to intro us, email me, or use this link."

I’m a 28-year-old male Machine Learning Engineer living in Rhode Island and I’m looking for a long-term relationship.\nSummary\nI’m a straight, nerdy guy and I love to spend my weekend working out, attending local live music events, or hanging out with friends or family.\nThough I’m a bit introverted at first, once I feel comfortable, I open up and enjoy good conversations. I love traveling, learning about history and culture, reading Japanese comics, and fitness.  I’m currently learning Japanese in my free time and am close to reaching a 1,000-day streak on Duolingo.\nMy life philosophy is to live peacefully and happily while minimizing the suffering of others. I enjoy nerd culture and memes but I dislike jump-scare horror movies, bad/lazy storytelling, materialistic individuals, and “grind culture”.\nI grew up in Pawtucket, Rhode Island with a family of interesting characters. I was a bit of a black sheep growing up but I’m still close with my family. My family deeply values their Ghanaian culture, and I’ve learned to appreciate it over the years. Although I didn’t grow up speaking Twi, Ghana’s native language, I’ve picked up bits and pieces, and love how the language carries pieces of the culture. My friends and family describe me as Blunt, Straightforward, Loyal, and Practical.\nSome visuals\nGolden Hour while halfway up Mt. Inari in Kyoto, my favorite city in the world.\nIn the cockpit of a World War 1-era plane at the Great War Flying Museum near Toronto.\nSelfie with one of the super-friendly deers of Nara, Japan.\nI truly felt at peace while solo traveling through Japan\nWorking out is my favorite pastime. It helps relax me and I love the process of improving myself.\nWhat I’m looking for\nI’m looking for a woman interested in a long-term monogamous relationship. We’d be a good match if you:\nEnjoy anime or manga, love movies, or appreciate a good story.\nAre interested in Japanese culture, especially if you’re learning or know the Japanese language.\nLikes working out, especially weightlifting.\nValue your career and family.\nLove to travel and is okay with a partner who travels for work (you can travel with!).\nEnjoy a variety of music (rock, indie, rap, etc.).\nI’m looking for a “power couple” dynamic, where we are both able to stand on our own but are even better together and can catch each other when one of us slips. Open to marriage and children in the future. In a few years, I’d love to have a condo outside of Boston- closer to my job but not too far away from friends and family in Rhode Island.\nInterested?\nIf you think we’ll get along I would love to hear from you! Contact me via email (\n1nate146@gmail.com\n) or on Instagram (@natemen96) with a mention about the Date me doc!"

As for me, I'm a bit of a gentle giant at 6'8\" and 300 pounds. I'm proud to represent Baylor on the offensive line. When I'm not on the gridiron, you can find me diving into the worlds of Transformers, Marvel, and Star Wars. And though my golf game might need a little work, I love hitting the links whenever I can. As for music, I've got a pretty eclectic taste. Lately, I've been jamming to a lot of grunge rock and country, but I also have a soft spot for those classic 2000s pop hits.\"\r\n\"I’m looking for a woman in her early 20s, ideally a bit taller than 5’7”. I’ve always had a thing for freckles and brunettes, and I’m drawn to someone with a sharp wit who can keep up with my dry humor and oddball jokes. Music is a big part of my life, so I’d love to find someone who shares my tastes. While I might be a football fanatic, I’m totally cool with someone who doesn’t follow the game, as long as they can appreciate a good touchdown or a clutch field goal.\"\r\n“I really love living in the South and hope to stay here for a long time. I’d also love to start a family around the age of 29 or 30. That way, I’ll still be young and active enough to play with my kids when they’re growing up. My dad had me when he was 40, and it was tough for him to keep up with me and my brothers. So, I’m hoping for a different experience.” \r\n\"I'm looking for someone who can appreciate my weirdness and share in the joy of life's simple pleasures.\"\r\nSelf-Disclosure: 've been trying to be more honest about myself recently, providing details that go beyond the fundamentals. Talking about my passion of sci-fi, such as Transformers, Marvel, and Star Wars, as well as my problems on the golf course, helps people understand who I am. It's more than just listing statistics; it's about revealing the aspects of myself that make me unique, such as my strange music choice and my desire to have a family someday. By being more honest, I hope potential partners may look beyond what I do and gain insight into my life.\"\r\nSelf-Esteem: When I composed this document, I felt compelled to be true and honest with myself. I mostly discussed my talents and weaknesses. and about my unusual characteristics. I would say I am not afraid to disclose that I am a larger guy, that I play offensive line, and that I am content with my height and weight. I also discuss my strange and eccentric interests, as well as how I am seeking for someone who shares my dumb sense of humor. I think it's incredibly vital to have confidence in yourself. \r\nSelf-Monitoring: I tried to be myself while still being aware of how I came across. I wanted to appear open and pleasant, so I kept my language light and conversational. I chatted about things I like, hoping to meet someone who shared my interests. I also listed topics that are significant to me, such as where I'm from and my goals for the future. I wanted to attract someone who was a good fit for me without feeling compelled to change who I am.\""

      "fullText": "Skip to content\nYou’re almost there — sign up to start building in Notion today.\nSign up or login\n🦆\nDate Kaushik Donthi (Me)\nShare\n🦆\nDate Kaushik Donthi (Me)\nTable of contents\nProblem statement\nGoals\nNon-goals\nProposed solution\nInterests and Hobbies\nValues\nPictures\nSuccess Criteria\nImplementation and rollout plan\nProblem statement\nI decided to use one of the Engineering solution templates from Notion, so my problem is figuring out how to use this without making people think I need a group of overpaid college graduates to fix me.\nBut really, my goal is to find a loving, rewarding relationship with a female I am interested in and for whom I am willing to sacrifice the time necessary to build a relationship. Someone who is kind, intelligent, silly, curious, courageous, and empathetic. And very importantly, someone who is emotionally mature enough to realize the kind of work and sacrifices that a relationship entails.\nI am pretty flexible about the actual location, since my job is usually remote. Buttt I am a sucker for good weather - I’ve lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and in Malaga, Spain for a little bit so I am not going to pretend that living in Norway would be perfect for me. But love transcends all, right? 😛 I’ll try to use some of the existing fields in this template that I find are surprisingly appropriate or just funny.\nGoals\nIdeally - find someone who is compatible with me in a relationship sense by showing them this document and some pictures of me, at which point they will fall hopelessly in love.\nNon-goals\nMeeting more guys. Just kidding! If you think we would be two cubes in an ice tray, regardless of what your gender is, then totally message me and we can haaanggg. See “Implementation and Rollout Plan” for contact details.\nProposed solution\nMeet a lot more girls with the openness to a relationship or just a friendship depending on how we feel about each other. I see either as a win, but I want to be clear that my intention going into a meeting is 80% to date and 20% to be friends. To be clear, I love having a relationship that has the foundation of a friendship. But I am not sure how this is possible unless we read this doc, signed a binding contract to be friends, erased our memories, and then one day felt that we could be more.\nI think it’s easier going from “Ah I don’t see this working out as a relationship, but we can totally drink boba like every 5 weeks” rather than “Hey we drink boba like every 5 weeks, but I want to see you again tomorrow.”\nInterests and Hobbies\nProgramming - I am a software engineer who has worked for blockchain companies (trading and gaming-related) and I am extremely grateful that I truly enjoy my work! I love building things with an end customer in mind and I find it awesome that solving cool problems can make peoples’ lives better. Somehow, I think the universe was beautifully designed that way.\nMath/Physics\nI kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world\nI have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation\nI used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\nStrategy Games\nReally Like\nCatan (I love the 1v1 version of Colonist, I was ranked Diamond two seasons ago and btw the username is from Looking for Alaska by John Green haha)\nSecret Hitler\nSoccer\nLove/Hate\nChess\nTennis (love watching it though)\nHate\nUno (is this even strategy?)\nLosing (in honesty, I can get pretty competitive sometimes haha)\nBeing active\nRunning\nSwimming Way Too Deep in the Ocean (SWTDO)\nRowing\nComedy\nImprov (for me, humor compatibility in a relationship is huge and if I can do a bit with you, that is a huge plus)\nConan O’Brien <3\nValues\nHonesty\nI am the kind of person who tries to say what is on his mind in a compassionate, caring way towards myself and others\nI think short-term discomfort is worth long-term growth\nI really resonate with the quote from the Kite Runner, “That's the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.” It just means to me that if we both trust ourselves to be honest, we can assume good intention and it just makes things soooooo much easier (and we can also move much faster haha!)\nGentleness/Kindness\nI don’t feel like a man needs to be “assertive” or “dominant”; I think being gentle and kind is strong in it’s own way\nI think being kind and loving and holding someone’s heart with care are so much more important and I want to be with someone who values the care I give to them\nFighting Well\nI think in a relationship fights are inevitable, but I think healthy relationships fight well\nPhysical violence is not okay, as are demeaning comments\nWe try to argue our points to the best of our knowledge and acknowledge good points from the other side\nWe are both mentally healthy enough that we do our best to make it work but have the power to walk away at any time\nHealth\nI have become much healthier over the last 7 or 8 years and I would love to meet someone who also cares about what they put in their body\nI love to exercise on a regular basis, whether it is swimming, running, rowing, or playing soccer\nI don’t expect my partner to be interested in the same activities (I guess this goes for really everything I’ve said so far haha)\nAlso pretty into meditation, although my view on its importance has changed a lot over the past few years\nSelfish Altruism with a Mix of Loving Without Expectation\nI think it is important to figure out what brings you joy and how you can use that to bring joy to others\nBare altruism is rarely a good long-term goal - how many vegetarians/vegans have you met who did it for the sake of the world but gave up because of how futile they felt their attempts were in making a dent in the animal consumption problem?\nFor me, becoming almost fully vegetarian/vegan was a decision inspired by my getting healthier and looking better\nBut I think loving yourself allows you to love others best :); and loving without expectation is the best way to show up in life and in a relationship - that love doesn’t have any promises; you just have to be grateful for every moment, and enjoy every single moment\nCuriosity/Playfulness\nI love being just fun and silly and weird and my humor can be dirty sometimes with people I feel comfortable with, and I hope to find someone I can play with for the rest of my life\nI think that the universe is somehow inherently playful - it does without any purpose and it rewards joy and spreading happiness\nI think everything is connected from chess to physics to swimming to flowers and I love to find and think about these connections\nBelief/Confidence/Ambition\nI truly believe that the universe works with you on goals you really believe in and that the universe responds when you ask it for something and put a full-hearted effort into it\nI think working towards goals that ignite us is what we live for and it’s important to me that my partner is decently ambitious as well\nPhysical Connection\nPhysical touch is one of my love languages, so I would ideally like to be with someone who also likes that :)\nI think sex to me is a part of expressing love in a relationship, and while it shouldn’t be at the forefront of what’s going on, I think it’s important that there is good physical compatibility\nI don’t think about sex that much at all, unfortunately, so I can tend to be bad at initiating; however, this is something I am happy to work on\nPictures\nAnd here are some (silly) pictures of me! I guess if I had to describe myself, I am a 5’ 10.5’’ guy who tends to be kind of skinnier/toned side. A lot of these are in Europe (I lived in Spain for a bit last year!) and I switch a lot between having and not having a beard, so I’ll include pictures of both 🙂\nI didn’t even get to go to the top :,) But maybe we can?\nALT\nYeah I guess you could say I get a lot of kudos\nALT\nWhat’s up with my posture lmao\nALT\nDon’t show this to my mom (I’m a momma’s boy if you couldn’t tell)\nALT\nJust for balance, a picture my mom probably likes\nALT\nSuccess Criteria\nHow will you validate the solution is working correctly?\nHopefully, we can be very open with each other if we think things are working out. I am sometimes really good but otherwise hopelessly lost in reading signs from girls.\nI also don’t want to waste either of our time - I think a relationship is an opportunity cost and I hope that we are both gaining something from our time together to make up for it.\nWhat monitoring and alerting will you do to ensure this project doesn’t decrease performance and reliability?\nI will constantly ask ChatGPT 4.5 to tell me what I am doing wrong\nImplementation and rollout plan\nIf you read all that and you think you still want to meet me, I guess maybe you’re pretty cool yourself.\nHaha, did you actually fall for this big pile of steaming …? Okay sorry, like I said my humor can be a bit strange sometimes. Hopefully, you didn’t actually stop reading. Or if everyone stopped reading, would anyone ever read this? I wonder if I could just write whatever I wanted down here. Like YO MAMMA IS SO FAT, THAT SHE GOES THROUGH A LUNAR CYCLE EVERY TIME SHE PIROUETTES. Who said my jokes were good?\nJeez, okay… I will try to be serious for like 20 seconds. If you think we would be a good fit, text me at (plus one) five one zero, seven seven one, four nine one four. Or email me at kaushikdr@gmail.com. Or do both?"

His work bridges cutting-edge machine vision and deep learning techniques with practical applications in health, such as the development of generative models for\ndigital pathology. Carson's work has spanned basic research in the cognitive neuroscience of human vision, the neuroscience of Buddhist meditative states,\nand many practical applications of machine learning to diagnostic healthcare problems. His research is driven by a desire to improve human health, happiness, and flourishing, whether mental or physical.\nHe believes in driving forward practical technologies while sharing and publishing relevant scientific findings with the world.\nCarson has a long-running interest in Mysticism, and believes that there\nis not such a difference between the tools we think of as \"therapeutic\",\nand millenia-old mystical traditions such as Buddhism and Daoism. A culture,\nsuch as ours, which is overly materialistic and has lost touch with the subjective,\nthe natural, and the ritualistic, is at risk of collapsing under its own weight.\nCarson hopes that his teaching, writing, and research will help bridge this divide,\nand make esoteric mysticism more legible to the rationally-minded scientist.\nWe rarely hear the inner music, but we are all dancing to it nonetheless.\n- Rumi\nPlease do reach out if you are interested in research collaboration, coaching, or consultation!\nResearch and Teaching\nI have two Neuroscience degrees (Caltech BA 2013, UC Berkeley Masters 2019). I have also worked as a\nresearcher and Data Scientist at Google Machine Intelligence, YouTube, and Verily Life Sciences. My research interests span medical imaging, neuroscience, machine intelligence, and Dharma science.\nGoogle Scholar profile\nLinkedIn profile\nResearch Tools\nUltrasound Neuroimaging\nAt Forest Neurotech, we are developing a device that can image and modulate functional activity\nin the human brain cheaply, portably, and minimally-invasively.\nWe hope this technology will be used to treat a wide range of conditions from\ndepression to addiction\n,\nas well as brain-machine interfacing\nand neuroscience research.\nAutofluorescence Microscopy\nWhile at Verily, I worked on the\nVirtual Stainer\nproject. We used generative learning to predict histological stains from autofluorescence scans of unstained tissue. See\n(McNeil et al., 2024)\n, in Modern Pathology, and other publications.\nMedical Image Embedding\nI worked on a project to use Masked-Siamese Networks to embed colonscopy videos in a semi-supervised way. See\n(Shor, McNeil et al., 2024)\nFunctional Neuroanatomy\nWhile at Berkeley, I was in the\nGallant Lab\nwithin the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research org, working on fMRI research projects to model the human visual system.\nHuman Emotion\nWhile at Google Machine Intelligence, I kicked off a collaboration between Google and Berkeley to study emotion in human faces using DNNs. 5 years later, this collaboration produced\n(Cowen et al. 2021)\nin Nature. I have an ongoing interest in emotion and mental health.\nDrugs and the Brain\nWhile at Berkeley, I taught the course\nDrugs and the Brain\nunder\nProf. David Presti\n. At Caltech, I taught a class of the same name under\nProf. Henry Lester\n. Psychedelics, as a therepeutic, spiritual, and investigative tool remain of interest to me.\nCreative Content\nScienctific work is creative work. But I have also produced a lot of more casual content.\nSubstack Essays\nMedium Essays (will move to Substack)\nYouTube Channel\nYouTube Lectures\nI have several long-form talks on psycho-spiritual frameworks on my\nYouTube Channel\n. These were given at a private event, and due to popular acclaim, I posted them online. Perhaps more on this theme will follow.\nEssays\nI write essays sometimes, which I post to my\nSubstack\n. The topics range between philosophy, poetic, light research projects, and psychology. For example:\nPolyamory doesn't Liberate; Monogamy doesn't Protect by Carson\nReflections and community quotes from a decade in the Bay Area dating landscape.\nRead on Substack\nWedding Ritual Design for a Pluralistic Society by Carson\nA recollection of, and guide to, hand-crafting a syncretic, modern, and personal wedding ceremony.\nRead on Substack\nFlirtations with Death by Carson\nNecro-posting an old note from my Medium with some extra explication on the macabre.\nRead on Substack\nADHD: Steroids, The Gym, and The Game  by Carson\nThe Game is changing, and this is twice as true on college campuses, where the amphetamine black market is booming … Given my own experience and that of friends, I was surprised to see the positive effects [of meditation] were so mild, until I saw the meditation protocols. … Would you go to the gym for 5 minutes a day and expect any sort of change?\nRead on Substack\nContact\nThis contact form will send to a tagged place in my email, where I am likely to see and respond to it.\n- Subject -\nResearch Collaboration\nConsulting\nCoaching\nOther\nSend Message\n© Carson McNeil.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply."

      "fullText": "﻿EDIT: as of late 2024, I’ve found my life partner. We’re in a non-monogamous relationship, so you can still fill in the form below or reach out directly if you might be interested in a flirtation or fling. I’ve left the rest of this doc unedited from the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nI very much want a life partner who orients towards the world in a similar way as I do. I’m writing this document in the hope of finding her; please share it with women you think might be a good match. I’m male, 30, living in San Francisco, working in AI. Whether or not I have kids will depend on my partner (see section on that below). I’m open to going on dates with people who live elsewhere, but have trouble seeing myself living outside a major global city in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are five of my defining traits; I’d love to find a partner who shares them with me. If they resonate with you, fill in this form or reach out directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth\r\n* I think of the world as full of opportunities waiting to be seized - which even if we can’t get to yet, we’ll be able to tomorrow. I want to be with someone who sees themselves as a work in progress, like I am; and whose default attitude is \"why not?\"\r\n\r\nFor me, growth mindset is closely entangled with the idea of making the future of technology go well, which is the focus of most of my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectualism\r\n* It's most natural for me to relate to the world in an analytical, systematizing way. I'd love to have a partner who, like me, is strongly driven to understand what’s going on around them, to grasp the intellectual edifice humanity has been building, and to fill in the gaps themselves - not just in academic domains, but anywhere their curiosity leads them. For a picture of what this looks like in me, try reading my blog or my twitter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI often get along particularly well with people who read a lot as children, like I did. \r\n\r\n\r\nTeamwork\r\n* I want a relationship which is deeply cooperative: two people building something in collaboration, where strong communication is the default and we trust that we can handle problems together. Some examples of how I’ve worked towards this in previous relationships:\r\n   1. Scheduling an hour each week to raise issues and possible improvements.\r\n   2. Taking a course on non-violent communication together.\r\n   3. Doing circling together.\r\n\r\n\r\nRereading that list, it all sounds… kinda serious? But the spirit I’m pointing towards is much less so: if we can laugh at all sorts of things (including ourselves) together, we’re most of the way towards being a good team. And for me, being a good team is the essence of romance - everything else is built on top of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowardsness\r\n* By “towardsness” I mean being motivated by actively wanting to move towards desirable outcomes, rather than just away from undesirable outcomes. The latter typically comes from fear-based motivation (as I write about at length here). I think fear-based motivation is far more extensive than most people typically recognize, and that excitement-based motivation which actually focuses on moving towards goals is a kind of superpower.\r\n\r\nI previously formulated this point as a desire for a partner with prosocial motivations. But I now tend to think that overcoming fear (in particular deeply-rooted fear) is the main bottleneck to that, and that almost everyone would have pretty prosocial motivations if they were more emotionally integrated. And so I’m not really looking for a partner who cares deeply about any specific thing; I’m looking for a partner with the capacity to care deeply at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayfulness\r\n   * I balance the more serious traits above with an irreverent attitude towards life. I like spontaneous adventures, I like starting dancefloors, and I like thinking of rules as made to be broken. People are often surprised by how playful I am in person - it doesn’t come through much in writing, where my intellectual side takes charge. (In this doc, my whimsical side keeps trying to slip things in, but my romantic side keeps overwriting them because it thinks finding a life partner is SERIOUS BUSINESS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person I’m writing this for might not have all the traits I’ve listed (or might not yet know that she does). But because we care about the same things on a deep level, I think she would want to have them eventually - just as the traits that she’s looking for are probably the ones I’m already aiming for. Maybe we can develop them together.\r\n\r\n\r\nA note on children\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main priority is finding the right partner; how many kids I have will largely depend on her preferences. Some possibilities I could be happy with:\r\n   1. A partner who wants to have 3+ kids and to be the main caregiver for them.\r\n   2. A partner who wants to have 1-2 kids and split responsibilities fairly evenly (but also get help from nannies etc, which I'm fortunately in a financial position to be able to pay for).\r\n   3. A partner who doesn't want kids because she (and I) find their work very meaningful and we want to prioritize that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize these are pretty different. One way of reconciling them: I want to have life projects with my partner; kids are one possible life project but not the only one; and so it's hard to be concrete before knowing who I want to co-create these life projects with. I'm not apathetic about kids—I think having kids is one of the most life-affirming things you can do. But I don’t want to rule out being swayed towards other life trajectories by the right person.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other things about me\r\n\r\n\r\nMy guess is that, for the people I’m looking for, the traits I’ve talked about so far are likely to be the strongest signal that we should try going on a date. But here are some other facts about me that might help:\r\n   * I’ve spent most of my career at frontier AGI labs, working on a wide range of different topics. Now I do independent research on what I consider to be the most impactful and interesting research directions in the world (a mix of AI governance and theoretical AI alignment). For an accessible introduction to my thinking, try this podcast. I’m excited about my work, and it’s important to me.\r\n   * I embrace life. I seize opportunities to dance, sing, travel, play practically any sport, read, socialize, and try new things. I’m energetic and adventurous.\r\n   * I am fundamentally okay with myself, even as I strive to be better. I don’t easily get flustered, angry, or insecure. Growing up in New Zealand gave me an underlying relaxed optimism about the world (although it's now often expressed via a very Californian type of ambition).\r\n   * I’m unfussy about many conventionally-valued traits like a partner’s level of formal education, career trajectory, finances, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think my weakest traits from a dating perspective are that:\r\n   * I’m not very empathetic on a gut level. This sometimes surprises people, because I'm unusually good at understanding and engaging with my own and others' emotions. But on an instinctive level, when I’m not actively trying to be empathetic, I still tend to default to thinking abstractly rather than putting myself in other people's shoes.\r\n   * I work a lot, driven in part by my belief that technological progress (and particularly progress in AI) is going to accelerate a lot over the coming decades, potentially making this the most important century. This may be disconcerting for some potential partners.\r\n   * I’m short for a guy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m still on good terms with all of the women I dated seriously during the past five years; here are reviews from two of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Richard is great. 5 out of 5 stars. It didn't work out with us but the quality of friendship we have now speaks for itself. He is one of the smartest people I know. Discussing things with him is great. Sharp and constructive. He has great friends. Absurdly good at any sport. Downside: bit chaotic, no taste for good food 😉\"\r\n\r\n\r\n“Richard is weirdly good at being in a relationship; I can think of three or four concrete ways I'm emotionally healthier after having dated him. One notable omission from this doc is the flip side of him being less empathetic than average on a gut level, which is that it feels easy to express feelings to him and negotiate conflict because he can accept intense emotions without getting caught up in them. He's more whimsical than the doc would suggest, though not less serious. Moreover, he is an excellent kisser and throws very good parties.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some photos of me:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we could be a good match (or you have a friend who might be), fill in my form, email me at richardcngo@gmail.com, tweet at me, tell a mutual friend to arrange a rendezvous, throw pebbles at my window, write me a song, or send me a document like this of your own! (If you're not sure what to say, tell me about a favorite book or song, or something you're looking forward to over the coming year.) If you’re uncertain, please do err on the side of getting in touch - writing is much lower-bandwidth for discovering compatibility than meeting in person, and the heavy-tailed outcomes here are skewed very positively!"

      "fullText": "﻿Date Josh\r\nLast updated April 2025. Feel free to share with friends, but please don’t reshare publicly.\r\n  \r\n              \r\n34, male, straight-ish\r\nIf I weren’t a human I would be a golden retriever (confirmed independently by multiple friends!)\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: I live in Boulder, CO. I visit the SF Bay several times per year and NYC/Boston a few, have dear friends on both coasts and enjoy excuses to travel in general. I’m happy to make connections with folks who live far away, but am unlikely to form an attachment relationship across long-term distance. I’m open to relocating for a life partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m seeking: Intentional romantic partnership that could grow into family-shaped life partnership; I’d like to reproduce in the next few years but I don’t feel rushed about it. (While I’m open to any connection that sparks mutual delight, I’ll prioritize these over others.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy deal: I’m generally easy-going and rarely have strong preferences; I like doing pretty much anything if it’s with my people. Acts of service are a big love language for me. I have a science and engineering background and have been very successful as a programmer. I’ve had numerous people tell me within a few minutes of meeting me that I seem unusually kind or loving to them. I tend to be somewhat reserved with strangers but am very comfortable being vulnerable with people who’ve shown me they’re here for that. I’m skilled in talking about feelings, including hard ones, without being triggered by them. I think I’m a good provider and a good stable “rock”. I like puns, dogs, airplanes, and the outdoors, and can operate all of them with reasonable competency. I give good hugs and snuggles.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship structure: I’ve been polyamorous for my whole adult life, because I think being more fully able to engage with connections that might arise is worth some emotional and logistical overhead. At the same time, it’s important to me to be able to offer (and to feel) stability and safety in partnership, even when that conflicts with optionality. My preference is for a relationship that is strongly mutually prioritized but not exclusive. I’m also open to sexual or romantic exclusivity if it welcomes emotional closeness and non-sexual touch outside the relationship. I currently have one long-term partner; we intend to share a family unit or cohousing project indefinitely, but we are open to that being in a capacity other than as romantic partners, and we’d actively love to have more people in it than just us.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested?: There’s a lot more I could say, but it would be more fun to tell you in person! You can reach me using the handle under the photos on Twitter, Facebook, or gmail dot com."

      "fullText": "﻿Intro:\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! My name is Rich, short for Ullrich, and I’m looking for someone to seriously date with the intention of marriage and family.  I’m committed to staying on the west side of LA for the next year at least, but my location flexibility opens up a bit after that. Aside from my day job, I’m doing maintenance and renovations in exchange for greatly reduced rent, so I’m using the opportunity to pay down student loans and save up for a down payment on a home. As such, although I’m not cheap, I do prefer cooking and eating at home rather than going out frequently, I’m content without luxury vacations, and keep travel to mostly hiking adventures and road trips for now, and so on.  Basically, budgeting wisely with an eye toward the future, while still trying to have at least a little adventure. \r\n\r\nI don’t believe in astrology, but if it pleases you, I’m a Cancerian and a Water Pig. Which means, I guess, that I’m very loving but I’ll be sad and stubborn if you hurt my feelings?  Sounds about right. I’m non-religious, something of a socialist, but have a nuanced enough outlook that I don’t totally fit into any of the typical containers. I’m an optimist most of the time, but not all of it.  I value kindness, humility, and serenity. If you're kind to your server, tip well, and clean up after yourself at a restaurant, if you always return your shopping cart, if you're considerate of others out in public, if you can appreciate the understated -- then you're my kind of person. Not that I eat out often. I’ll take the stairs over the escalator or lift, and I’m happy to park a little further back and walk, rather than spending an age searching for a better spot. Fair warning though - I seldom can remember where I parked. I would really appreciate a partner who could provide strength against that particular weakness. \r\n\r\n\r\n Oh, and here’s what I look like, all 5’10” of me. The first picture was taken in August of 2024, so these are recent:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have what may be considered an extreme and rigid diet. I only eat meat. Over six years Carnivore for Health - ask me about it! Besides the first year of pandemic, when I was drinking for something to do. Bad idea. I'm still paying for that, but it's further evidence that I'm on the right path now. I'm very passionate about holistic health through diet, and for the benefits to overall human health and to the environment from eating a ruminant-based diet. It's important to me and I don't expect my partner to be a carnivore too, but I won't be able to share dessert or have just one bite of this or that. In a relationship I would at least want someone into holistic diet, sustainability, and interested in a health conscious lifestyle both for us and for any potential children. I realize that this will raise a lot of questions, but it’s not something I need to frequently talk about, so if you want to know more, I’ve provided more detail about this at the end of this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinued vvv\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily:\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t have a relationship with my family. The silver lining here is that with me, you wouldn't have to worry about any in-laws in the picture. I'm happy with where I am and I've done a fair amount of self-work and therapy so I'm truly okay here - this information is for you. Since I have no ties to my family, I am open to taking my wife's last name when I get married again, provided it is her own name and not an ex husband's. And if she's not interested in that, perhaps she can help me pick out a new last name together. I am divorced (2005-2016, no kids), and moved to California to start over eight years ago. \r\n\r\nI grew up in a large Italian-American family, heavy emphasis on family, so it’s been a bit dissociating being so disconnected from mine, but it was a choice I made along with input from my therapist, and I’ve been happy. Still, I’d be happy to become a part of my partner’s family, and in time, build our own.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoals/Background:\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my other short term goals is to go back to school. I'm thankful that my job has been stable during these times, but I want to flesh out a path that's a little bit more meaningful. I currently only have an associate's degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time I was in a dual Bachelors-Masters program for Dietetics at Eastern Michigan University, and after I became a practicing dietitian I intended to start studying endocrinology. I've always been deeply moved and fascinated by the way what we consume affects our hormonal chemistry and in turn our metabolic health. I've taken more credits over the years than most people who do have master's degrees. But while I was in the middle of that dietetics program, my father passed away, I put a pause on school to deal with the fallout, and I wound up depressed, divorced, and moving to California to start over. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy original plan was to finish school once I had my California residency, but I wound up with a decent career and just went with it, shifting my focus instead on trying to meet somebody to settle down and start a family with. But, a handful of relationships that didn't work out later, I find my career in a place where I'd really like to take the next step and move up so I'm thinking it's about time to finally get serious about going back to school. I always figured that I would finish education and career moves after I settled down with somebody. I realize it may not be the right priority, but it's the way my brain is wired. A lot of things in life just seem easier when you're connected with somebody special. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt this juncture I need to actively start working on both. I'd love to meet my forever person while at the same time continuing to advance myself.\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinued vvv\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to a relationship I'm interested in finding someone who would like to share a health conscious lifestyle, who likes occasional hikes, and shares passions in social justice, sustainability, kindness, and generally making choices that will help people. Maybe we can go clean a beach up early morning, then walk along it holding hands? \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also very passionate - touch and quality time are my love languages - I want a slow burn before intimacy, but once we’re there, I like to make out slow and sensually, and go down on my partner frequently, and I'm big on cuddling and aftercare. I'm happy with your natural humanity and I don't care whether you shave or put on makeup. We can curl up and I'll play with your hair while we whisper silly things to each other. We can wake up in each other’s arms and kiss good morning. I think it's very sensual and erotic to be with someone who is comfortable enough to be a natural human being around me. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome combination of occasional hikes and nature walks, lazy nights watching a romcom or playing boardgames, cute walks through downtowns, playing with puppies, thrift shopping, cooking together and dancing in the kitchen, having deep conversations about the world around us, challenging each other to learn and grow, and sharing values of curiosity, kindness, compassion, and exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther quirks\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m not much of a gamer, but after work sometimes I like to unwind by playing Minecraft for a little bit. I’m a very silly, happy go lucky person. One moment I can be serious and the next I can be doing a gollum impression or thinking up a ridiculous pun. While my music taste is varied and eclectic (the first CD I ever bought with my own money was Best of the Village People!) -  I often don’t put on music. I enjoy the quiet.  I’ve had my puppy for six months now and she still hasn’t got a name… I’ve tried on many names, but nothing has stuck so far. I’m left-handed, a bit of a nerd, and I enjoy writing sonnets and other poetry.  For years I did an online writing roleplay pretending to be someone living in 15th century Europe, just writing stories with others from around the world.  I enjoy hikes, but I’m just as happy playing board games or curling up to watch a Ghibli flick.  I like romantic comedies, broadway musicals, Lord of the Rings, and I’d love to go to the opera with someone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to get in touch, whether as a friend or potentially something more, please reach out! You can find me on instagram @xyphratl (tw: plenty of pictures of meat), or shoot an email to xyphratl@gmail.com . Let me know you found me here! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about my all-meat diet:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs promised, some more information for the morbidly curious:\r\n\r\n\r\nI prefer cooking and eating at home over going out, and I'll happily cook for others, even dishes that I won't personally eat. I don't consider myself a picky eater because I like almost everything (except artichokes... I'm a bad Italian-American); I just choose not to eat it for health purposes. That said, I'm not difficult to go out with. I can find something at almost any restaurant, or happily have a sparkling water or cup of tea while others enjoy ramen or dessert. I'm definitely at least ketogenic for life, and possibly carnivore for life. \r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this is both optimal human nutrition, and beneficial to the environment at large. When a field of grains is harvested, countless birds, rodents, and other bugs and critters are killed. But from just one cow, you can eat for nearly an entire year. Ranches that practice regenerative ranching, such as White Oak Pastures, can actually have a carbon negative effect, reverse desertification, and be a tool to fight against climate change. And chances are, when you eat a steak, its source is fewer than 50 miles from where you're sitting. On the other hand, monocrop agriculture is terrible for the planet, creates runoff crises, extreme water use, depletes soil, and the food miles on processed grains and produce are astronomical. And besides, vegans fart more than cows do anyway. That's not just a quip. Studies show that vegans flatulate seven times more than someone on a standard American diet. And people on a carnivore diet do it seldomly altogether. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy LDL cholesterol is \"high\" as you might expect. I'm okay with this. My triglycerides are extremely low and I still have what's considered a great ratio. Beyond this, I don't consider a high cholesterol to be a negative. Although I'm pro-vaccine, there is also room for natural human immunity. LDL cholesterol transports vitamins through the bloodstream and can also engulf pathogens and foreign substances much like a neutrophil. We've been pushing low cholesterol since the 1950s and metabolic disease has skyrocketed since... it's no wonder natural human immunity isn't as robust as it should be. Unless I meet my demise by some kind of violent or accidental end, I'm going to outlive all the people taking statins and eating low-fat diets. My cognitive function will also outlast the vast majority of theirs. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information I invite you to check out The Cholesterol Code, or the work of Mary Enig on seed oils, or Sally Norton on oxalates, or Gary Taubes, Judy Cho, Nina Teicholz, doctors Jason Fung, Shawn Baker, Anthony Chaffee, Ken Berry, Lisa Wiedeman, Robert Kiltz, Paul Saladino... and more! With all of that being said, carnivore is my diet, but not my lifestyle or identity. It's important for my partner to know and understand where I am coming from and what I value, and I've written all of this because I understand that most people will have many questions, but it's not really something that I'll constantly be talking about."

      "fullText": "﻿Pip Moss - Date Me Doc\r\n* Age: 35\r\n* Height: 5’6”\r\n* Occupation: Solicitor \r\n* Location: London, UK.\r\n* Looking for: Women, ideally long term relationship but open to starting and seeing where we get to. Not fussed on mechanics of relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Top priorities:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Significant Overlap of Values. We don’t have to agree on everything but I want to be able to wake up and spend a bit of every day helping you achieve your goals and feel good about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Intellectual Curiosity. I like knowing things, from trivia to social research, and I like people telling me things. I’ll enjoy learning new things for the rest of my life and it would probably be good if you did too because I’ll want to talk about them. Weirdly attracted to people who cite their sources in everyday conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * General Zest for Life: I like my calendar being fairly full of things to do, be they attending talks or trying a new type of exercise. I have main hobbies but am always up for trying something new. I’d really value someone pushing me in new directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Clear Communication. I’m a direct communicator and can only really be like that. I’m very honest (but not tactless) and take honesty fairly seriously, which friends and family mostly really like.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Independence. I want a partner, and a partnership, rather than someone to completely merge lives with until we are practically one person. I want to do lots of things with you but wouldn’t expect you to curtail having a life and projects outside of ‘Us’ and I’d want that balance for myself too.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Non-Negotiables:\r\n   * I don’t want kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I can’t bear the smell of tobacco. Am not much better with cannabis though if you never smoked where we lived I could maybe manage.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Slightly Negotiables:\r\n   * I’m a pretty committed urbanite. I’ve lived in London and Manchester, and might live in other cities in the future but really value living centrally and the lifestyle that allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I’m not religious or a believer in the supernatural, and while I don’t mind if you are I am unlikely to ever buy-in and share that beyond joining festivals to be supportive/share experiences.\r\n\t* My Main Hobbies: \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Bouldering, Running, Obstacle Course Running. Three years ago I tried bouldering and I’ve fallen into a fitness lifestyle since then. I climb twice a week, run a similar amount, and am working towards the London Marathon in 2026. Allez!\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Cooking. I cook from scratch almost everything I eat and like expanding my repertoire. Currently trying different seitan recipes as I become ‘Pesc-an’ (Vegan, plus fish). Got a great vegan brownie recipe. Love cooking for friends and family, and would love to cook for a partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Cat lover. Currently sharing my house with my cat Serral.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Random research online. From perusing Wikipedia (then double-checking it) to reading government reports, I like knowing more about the world. I’m the kind of person who will fact check myself online. I try to live an evidence-based life and want a data-driven world.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Visiting Museums/Galleries/Places of Interest/Classical Music Performances. No particular theme as to where, I just like seeing friends at somewhere more interesting than a coffee shop if we can. What else is life in London for? Most recent trip: Freemasons Hall. Beautiful but left me with more questions than answers!\r\n   *    * Political Gambling. I’ve been betting on elections since I was 20, with a good record. I sometimes write about it. But I’m an obsessive, not an addict. I even have the spreadsheets to prove it…\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Board Games. Also another great way to spend time with friends. I’m not hyper-competitive but do tend to do a bit of pre-research and want to give a good account of myself. OK maybe I am competitive, but I’m a pretty good loser.\r\n\t* Values/Personality (This is not a checklist of things you have to be):\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I value agency and intentionality, in myself and others. I fear too many people too much of the time make decisions passively, by default or the path of least resistance. I want to live deliberately. I get frustrated by adults not taking accountability for their lives and I want to be held accountable for mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Introverted but outgoing in a comfortable environment. I like a busy social life, just not so open to events with heavy drinking or loud music.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Organised. I believe in systems. I meal plan, I track my freezer contents in Excel, I check my net worth quarterly, I often instigate and co-ordinate social plans in my friendship groups. I even have a spreadsheet for when I last saw each of my friends so I don’t forget someone for too long (the name turns red after 90 days). They laughed, but then half of them asked me for the template.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * High Decoupler. I don’t take disagreement personally and am happy to discuss almost anything in a dispassionate way. I try to be sensitive to other people’s discomfort, but I’m rarely unwilling to answer a personal question or consider an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Environmentalist. I cycle most journeys if I’m not on the Tube and I very rarely fly for leisure at the moment (though I might in future, especially if I found some effective offsets). I’m also a YIMBY and a New Urbanist. Don’t own a car, but can drive and would get one if it made sense for my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Effective Altruist. By which I mean I donate 10% of my salary to effective charities and generally buy-in to the concept.\r\n\tSome more photos of me:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking the most of the period Serral was light enough to hold up on one arm. I actually have a shirtless version of this from another day but that felt tacky to share unprompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Parkrun photo with two friends who got me into running and whom I owe many thanks for that and much besides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEscape Room triumph with a friend of mine. The room was Battle of Britain themed, we didn’t just turn up like this. Sadly."

In a nutshell, I’m trying to invent math that would enable methods of designing artificial intelligence systems which are much more responsible than how it’s done today. And, it’s very important to me: not just a job, but a life calling.\r\n\r\n\r\n⚛️As you might have guessed from the above, I’m a huge nerd. Math, computer science and physics are areas in which I have professional knowledge. I also know a little about history and analytic philosophy, and enjoy nerding out about virtually any intellectual topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n🌍Some properties of my world-view: I’m an atheist, transhumanist, vegan. Politically I’m a centrish liberal (I strongly support personal freedoms and democracy guardrails, dislike collectivism and traditionalism).\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I enjoy in my free time:\r\n* 📚 Reading, mostly scifi and fantasy, with a special soft spot for romance novels 💘. Favorite writers include Naomi Novik, Kate Elliot, Lois McMaster Bujold, Brandon Sanderson, Greg Egan and Sharon Shinn.\r\n* 🎲 Playing board games, even though I’m a sore loser.\r\n* 🧙‍♀️ Tabletop RPG, although I never manage to find a group that sticks together for long.\r\n* 🖼️ Art galleries, both classic and modern.\r\n* 🎭 Theatre. I haven’t seen many plays, but recently I enjoy it a lot.\r\n* 🎵 Listening to music, of almost any genre besides extreme metal. Some artists I like: Zaz, Nightwish, Beth Hart, Leonard Cohen, Rona Kenan, Muse.\r\n* 🌆 Walking around cities with good vibes or beautiful architecture (in particular, I love the old European cities).\r\n* 👠 Shopping with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n💍I've been married to my love and life-partner Marcus since 2021 (and we’ve been poly from the start). You can read our marriage vows here.\r\n\r\n\r\n🐱I have two children from my previous marriage. And also a cat.\r\nAbout You\r\n* ♀️♂️⚧️ I’m attracted to people of any gender and anatomy.\r\n* ⏳25-55 is my usual age range, might consider exceptions.\r\n* 🤔I like people with deep intellectual interests. Info-dump away please!\r\n* 🤗I like people who are kind and honest.\r\n* ↕️I don’t filter by height.\r\n* 🚭I don’t date heavy smokers.\r\nOur Relationship\r\n* 💞I want a mental, emotional and physical connection. Something that is only about sex is not in the cards.\r\n* 😋…but also, sexual exploration is fun ;)\r\n* 🫂Trust, openness and mutual support are key ingredients. Naturally, these will usually take some time to develop.\r\n* 🕰️I’m open to secondary relationships of any intensity, anything between seeing each other multiple times a week to meeting once in a blue moon.\r\n* ☄️If you live not in Israel it will by necessity be a comet (i.e. meeting once in a blue moon).\r\n* 🦄I also don’t mind dating a couple, but once again, only if it’s a relationship that’s much more than just sex.\r\n* 🖤BDSM is a lovely bonus (I’m a sub).\r\nMore Pics"

      "fullText": "﻿hello, i’m e (not my real name but it is suitable as a pseudonym) from texas (probably). i am 27 going on 28. i love competing in niche games primarily but i also love film and write about it occasionally. traveling to see my friends all over the world is typically where my money goes. it used to go to archive fashion but i have grown satisfied with my wardrobe and dissatisfied with spending my money on products. i don't buy anything physical besides clothes, food, and hygiene products. i am an antinatalist. i am a non-denominational leftist. i am generally speaking quite happy in my day to day as there are many things i find fulfilling.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am not posting photos of myself. this is not due to insecurity of my appearance (which i have learned to more or less live with) but because i don't value physical attraction in relationships and it's not something i care to maximize for myself. it also feels somewhat dishonest to work on my physical appearance when i have so much work to do on myself in other departments. i also want to limit pictures of myself on the internet to the best of my abilities, but i can of course send them directly if you interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nlikes and dislikes\r\n\r\n\r\nlikes:\r\n\r\n\r\ncompeting (ask me about which games if you're interested)\r\nwatching films (my favorite director is jacques rivette)\r\nwearing a nice outfit out\r\nfinding a good clothing deal\r\nhanging out with friends\r\nhelping my friends when they need help\r\nnice food\r\ntraveling to see friends\r\nnoise music, along with other kinds sometimes\r\nlearning\r\ntutoring math\r\nbouldering (even though i am bad at it)\r\n\r\n\r\ndislikes:\r\n\r\n\r\ndating (i prefer talking online)\r\nflirting (i will not flirt with you; it's nothing personal)\r\ndancing\r\nsex work (i have no beef with sex workers of course and would not object to dating one)\r\nbigotry\r\nvoting\r\nmachine washing clothing\r\ndriving \r\ndoing poorly in tournaments\r\nsports (i am interested in sports statistics however)\r\nnostalgia as a concept\r\nnormie designer bags\r\n\r\n\r\ni dislike biographies that try to sell the reader on the author; i find myself too insecure about my potential narcissistic traits to write about this. some people find me funny and intelligent, some people find me insufferable and dim; who knows what you will find me? i have nothing intrinsically positive to say about myself.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am very online and most my humor comes from this. i make okay money (from a boring job - you can ask about it if you’d like) but not enough to support a partner, something i feel extremely guilty about. i would prefer a long distance relationship as that is what is most familiar to me, but i am open to other possibilities. i am monogamous. one \"relationship\" setup that i wouldn't mind is a strictly platonic marriage in which i provide access to living in the US and, in exchange, i gain access to my spouse's insurance which allows me to retire early. an ideal romantic relationship would involve myself and my partner lifting each other up and trying to bring out the best in each other, and i think it would be most advantageous if we had at least one or two things in common if that is the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nas i mentioned earlier i don't find physical appearance important. i am also unconcerned with how much my partner makes, unless they are dependent upon me for survival which i don't know if i can guarantee that on my current income. you can contact me via discord at souljaboytellemdotcom if you'd like to talk - i am also open to just making new friends of course, if your primary takeaway is \"this guy sounds insane but i would like to talk about film and clothing with him.\" in any case i hope you have a nice day and find what you are pursuing : ) ."

      "fullText": "﻿Date or be friends with me doc\r\nSo, tell me about yourself…\r\n\r\n\r\nSure. I’ve broken this down into work & purpose, family & community, relationship leanings, joy, food, location, and what I look like\r\nWork & purpose\r\nI work as a user researcher and self defence instructor. My research mostly informs public service and policy though I research anything interesting e.g. DIY gene editing tools, bike paths, storm response systems etc. etc. I also run an Empowerment Self Defence charity. \r\nFamily & community \r\nFamily & community are priorities for me. I listed my work initiatives first because it’s where I’ve put most of my energy in the past without quite realising I was doing it. Recently, I've resolved to intentionally cultivate community and create family, rather than assume this will all work out with minimal intervention on my part. I’d love to create a relationship with a community around it; a relationship that is in itself a family and that also generates more family in some form.  \r\nRelationship leanings\r\nI’m into monogamous relationships, ones that are co-located, and I’d love to be in a relationship that feels like a great team.  \r\nJoy\r\nI can’t think of a lot to say about it other than: why not make a point of generating and savouring it?\r\nFood\r\nYes. Please. Ideally vegetables. Moderate drinker, more of a savourer than a guzzler. Sweet tooth problem (cake I can guzzle for some reason?) \r\nLocation\r\nUK, London \r\nAre you open to relocating?\r\nI can imagine doing this under some circumstances, and definitely know how to. Yet after moving back and forth across 3 continents for most of my adult life, I’m trying something newish (to me): staying in one place, becoming rooted. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also think I’ve exceeded the threshold of how many long distance relationships are sensible to have in one lifetime, so best if a partner and I live in roughly the same place.\r\nWhat are you looking for in a partner?\r\nQualities I deeply appreciate include: kindness, curiosity, a general sense of presence, attentiveness, introspective skills, interest in bodies, not just in how they look but in how they are, and how they connect, co-regulation (← which is more of a relational than individual attribute, but such a magic thing that I think worth mentioning.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d like to be and to be with someone we’d all want on a team; someone resourced, with skills and perspective to bring to the mix, someone who values learning and growth, someone who has my back as much as I have theirs. \r\nWhat do you think a relationship even is?\r\nI think of a relationship as a creation; something we cultivate intentionally, consciously, caringly; something we feel worthwhile to maintain and nurture even when that takes a little effort after the butterflies stop fluttering all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’d love to create a relationship that changes and expands as we do; that forms a secure ground from which we can step out into the world, have rich experiences, change, grow, and bring those changes and that growth back to each other and watch them enrich our relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also think of it as bowls of soup on the couch in winter, watching each other's bags at the train station so we don’t have to lug them to the toilet, arguing well, giggles, surprises, whispers, building community and creating some form of family e.g. with children, dogs, neighbours, friends, or a subset of these.\r\nCan we just be friends?\r\nIf we’re compatible as friends, yes please. I cherish friendship and have space and time for new ones. \r\nWhat do you and your world look like? \r\nHere are some reasonably recent photos that feel relevant\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI sit in a chair lots for work but like to move so I practise and sometimes teach chair yoga\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\nI lived on a boat for a while, and started to find land weirdly rigid\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nOne of my favourite little friends and me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLip syncing to Whitney Houston for a pandemic-era work zoom flash mob (sparkly shirt courtesy of downstairs neighbour)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne of my besties and me on a cold UK beach walk \r\n\t  \r\n\r\nThis is an improv scene about a toothache \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA hackathon about improving outcomes for violence survivors with trauma-informed self defence \r\n\tHow can I get in touch?\r\nSend me a line here :)"

We lived at her parents’ house.\nA lot of my childhood was spent listening to classic rock and watching Nick at Nite sitcoms.\nI lived a grunge rock teenage life: skateboarding, drugs, promiscuity, partying, and playing in a band.\nNow, I’m working on my second novel “The Depth of Middleclass Sorrow: a comedy”. My first novella “Tangled Shadows” is very important to me, and I hope it is significant to my future girlfriend too.\nThe best description of my personality is sincere, and analytic.\nI try to always be as kind and considerate as possible, though I was not always this way (I used to be an obnoxious, terrible person).\nI have been called “as funny as Eddie Murphy”.\nFor some time, I was a dedicated criminal. I had a crush on a woman who liked gangsters, so I ended up a felon (car theft), if she liked doctors: I would have tried to get a medical degree. I wanted to be a guerrilla soldier, but it is probably better that I was trying to rob jewelry stores, instead of making car bombs.\nEthnically/culturally, I am IrishAmerican-Catholic, from north of Chicago. Also, genetically, but not culturally, I am a quarter Mexican which is where I get my tan.\nI spend most of my time thinking about: philosophy, science, religion, mysticism, politics, culture, art, art history, psychoanalysis, math, history, sociology, anthropology, etc., and want someone with to have long, interesting discussions.\nMy main hobbies are biking, wall tennis, going to the movies, driving fast, reading, writing, museums, concerts, playing cards, travel, trivia, meditating, and sunbathing.\nRandom things I want to do: study history and vocabulary, lose 25 pounds/get in shape, work on craft/science/art projects, learn a trade, learn some Welsh (I can speak some Spanish).\nI used to look down on internet dating, because it was not the traditional way people met, but now: I see it as exceedingly more practical than traditional dating, and it can be romantic too.\nI have talked a lot about myself, but I am not an egocentric person. I will be at least equally interested, if not, mostly likely more interested in you (my future partner), than myself.\nBeware: if you become my girlfriend, you will be the most important person to me: I will sincerely care for you, and I will want to spend most of my time with you.\nIt is a non-negotiable of mine: someone who is also an only child of a single mother.\nI apologize for any typos or errors, I went to American public school.\nTo write (and maybe get some free margaritas):\nxavierjayrichards@aol.com\nIf you want to know the movies, music, books, and T.V. shows I like, ask me, I have a long list: I took down to make it quicker to read. Also, I have a longer version of this dating autobiography (if you are interested), that I cut down, because someone told me I “did not have to be so honest”, and to make it quicker to read.\nP.S.\nI wish there was a website/app where you could search: Polish, middle child, heavy metal, and find all the people like you, but that has yet to exist. A free search engine of dating profiles. Please someone make it.\nI should also say: I don’t want children, but I am open to possibly dating someone who has children. Like most people, I went through a phase of wanting to have children. Nor do I want pets, though I am good with animals, and had cats, a dog, and fish growing up: I don’t want the responsibility, and I don’t like the hair and waste of animals.\nThank you, very much, for reading. Maybe I know your best romantic match, and would be happy to introduce you.\nPlease share if you would.\nI have never really liked the name of this website. It comes from a time: I was drunk, on my back, in my apartment lobby, and someone asked if I “needed help”, and I thought to myself “that is something people do?”. I thought of a better name (but forgot it), but dont think it is important enough to change it. I’d rather not have this website, but how else do you find 1 person out of 8 billion?\nI hope everyone has happiness, choices, wisdom, good fortune, and finds their best romantic match, so on and such. And please, always try to be as kind and considerate as possible.\nLoading Comments...\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite"

I read like 20 articles a day and skim a hundred more, when they come in through my lovingly curated RSS feed reader which has been my baby for over a decade. Once or twice a month I'll work through an actual book as well [1], but not as often as I’ll paw through ao3 for longfic.\r\n* The ACX/rationality meetups organizer for my area (I also moonlight as the EA meetups organizer occasionally, and on rare occasions I help out with meetups in other cities). It brings me joy to connect to lots of cool, like minded people, and to connect them to each other.\r\n* Deeply interested in complex projects that take time and cleverness and skill — cultivating long lasting friendships and communities, getting to truly know a city and putting roots down, developing deep expertise in a special interest topic, building out a personal knowledge system, supporting loved ones and watching them grow into increasingly better versions of themselves over the course of decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] highlights from a recent quarter; fairly representative\r\n* Detransition Baby, Torrey Peters\r\n* Engineering Play, Mizuko Ito\r\n* Meditations on Violence, Rory Miller\r\n* Troubled,  Rob Henderson\r\n* Art in the After-Culture, Ben Davis\r\n* The Complete Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde\r\n* All Fours, Miranda July\r\n* Middlemarch, George Eliot\r\n________________\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nGender: cis female\r\nAge: 28\r\nSexuality: very gay [2]\r\nCurrent location: Waterloo, Ontario\r\nJob: Running a microceleb’s vanity think-tank (it’s a good think-tank, your honor.)\r\nKids: maybe [3]\r\nSeeking: a long term monogamous/primary relationship [4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] noting explicitly that I'm fine with dating transfem and NB people.\r\n[3] My mom gets to take her cool adult children to brunch and exchange gossip and life tips with them, and I want that for me when I'm her age. Also, see bullet point about long complex projects — that applies to raising kids as well. But those seem like not the best reasons to have a kid? ← But this also sounds like a bad reason to not have kids? But in addition I'm scared that it will go horribly wrong, which it can in many many ways (death or severe disability, I turn out to have an awful temperament for child rearing, kid just inexplicably ends up being a total asshole addicted to heroin). It’s a bit of a wash.\r\n[4] I've been weakly intrigued by poly/open relationships for a pretty long time, but all of my past relationships have been monogamous. I can't guarantee that non-monog relationships will work for me in practice, but I'm open to trying it out for unusually compatible folks.\r\nPotential Dealbreakers for Normal People\r\n* Can't co-sleep more than half of the time, it wrecks my sleep quality :(\r\n* Severe cat allergy — either Mittens goes or I do\r\n* Passenger princess (can't drive); need to live by at least one transit line\r\n* Hard requirement for curtains open and bright overhead lights on during the daytime. Sorry gamers\r\n* I donate 10% of my income to charity every year, this is extra non-negotiable\r\nAdditional Potential Dealbreakers for People In the Adjacency\r\n* I love having lots of physical things, so a nomadic/minimalist lifestyle isn't going to cut it for me (though this definitely doesn’t rule out extended travel). I need a homebase with space for my PC setup and my  craft supplies and my bookshelves and ideally a worktable and my lumenators and framed art pieces on all of the walls... you get the idea.\r\n* I’m kind of tired of the intellectual immune response towards social justice ideology; yeah it got excessive but I see the response as a devastating case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Like, I find much of pronatalism discourse intolerable because in many ways they're reinventing wheels that feminists have solidly established and were having sophisticated debates about by the late 70s, and this makes me want to turn into the jonker.\r\n* I am only into a few board games and am kind of an art snob about video games, and for games in general I have zero competitiveness drive or desire to improve. The only games I want to git gud at are the infinite ones 😎\r\n\r\n\r\nRead on if your deal has not been broken! For this doc I have chosen a strategy of highlighting my most polarizing traits upfront; I swear I also have straightforwardly good traits as well :P\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAbout You\r\n\r\n\r\n* Not a guy\r\n* Late 20s to early 30s\r\n* Ideally, like, medium agency? I like people who have thought about what they want and are taking actions towards getting it, but I don't particularly want to date a workaholic or someone who doesn't have time for a rich, fulfilling personal life.\r\n* Fun to chat with — at least two of smart, observant, funny, and good at ~texting, but more is better :)\r\n* This is a really good description of how I feel about the world, and I need it to also be what you feel, or at least for you to have a sense of the world that's compatible with it. Be surprised and dazzled and have your heart broken about the world with me.\r\n* Meets generic “good partner” requirements\r\n* Reasonably clean. We can't hang if you don't clean your bathroom or wash your sheets regularly\r\n* Physically active. I don't derive much joy from exercise but I do it regularly, and I suspect that having a partner that does not exercise will make me much more likely to fall off, and that would, you know, shorten my lifespan by many years, and that seems bad\r\n* Emotionally aware, communicates well, and is committed to improving the relationship over time through ongoing communication. I don’t need you to be an NVC master or anything like that, but I need you to make an honest effort, and for your honest effort to be not terrible.\r\n________________\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\n\r\nRecipe For Happiness Khaborovsk Or Anyplace\r\n Lawrence Ferlinghetti\r\nOne grand boulevard with trees\r\nwith one grand cafe in sun\r\nwith strong black coffee in very small cups.\r\nOne not necessarily very beautiful\r\nman or woman who loves you.\r\nOne fine day.\r\nthis could be us!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a partner in crime! I want to be egged on to start cool scary projects and I want to egg you on as well. I want us to host a hundred splendid dinner parties and do the washing up together afterwards while we bask in the success and discuss what we can do better next time. I want to go with you to art museums all over the world and plagiarize the pieces that are particularly good for our living room wall (I’m starting to develop a system for that).\r\n\r\n\r\nI want someone to go to the movies and late night snack runs with. I want someone beside me on the couch while we read our separate books or watch the next episode of a show together or plot our next big thing together in a google doc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, obviously, rushing the dating process would be the opposite of useful here, but I'm also excited about the big, slow things: to see what kind of doors open, what kind of projects we can take on, and how much we can change each other; year by year, decade by decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this sort of thing sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email and let’s see if we click: hi at jenn dot site. \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAppendix 1: Current Projects\r\nCommunity Building\r\n* I run weekly meetups for rationalists. I love designing meetups and I love running them and I love being surrounded by the kind of people who don't blink twice at having to do readings to show up to a meetup for discussing the readings. I want to keep poking at this group rationality thing, and in the meantime derive a regular dose of healthy intellectual stimulation.\r\n* Occasionally I'll throw in a wildcard meetup — we'll go see a theatre production or I'll run authentic relating games or I'll pull out some classic experiment for us to try to reproduce (we generally fail) or I'll make everyone put on blindfolds. I don't understand why more people aren't just absolutely delighted by the fact that they can throw incredibly weird parties purely for the sake of putting their friends in Situations. I try to take full advantage of this as much as I can.\r\n* I'm interested in building up something that lasts, and something that helps out the folks in it emotionally and materially. It's fortunate that this basically starts happening by default if you regularly see the same goobers with enough frequency. But you can always push it further along strategically as well.\r\nSkilling Up/Increasing Agency\r\n* Careers-wise, I’m currently focused on gaining generalist experience around all things involved in creating and running an organization. One of these days I'll find a cause area I have comparative advantage in and like, found an org about it, but I don't expect it to be any time soon; I love my current job!\r\n* I've been using LLMs a bunch, mostly because it's fun, partially because I think if jobs still exist in 20 years it'll be good to say that I have 20 years of experience with them, and partially because they're enabling me to do a lot more cool stuff and I'm curious to see how far I can push that. Like, I don't know how to code [5] but now I can make websites anyways! How cool is that :D\r\n* I tinker with personal knowledge management systems to figure out what's the best way of retaining all the stuff that I read. In my teens to early 20s I used Evernote, but it's only ever gotten worse so I moved away in the late 2010s. I currently have a tiny gem of an obsidian vault, designed to roughly Matuschakian specifications, but I wonder if it would be better on the whole if I made a higher quantity of worse, lower effort notes.\r\nDeveloping Aesthetics\r\n* I visit a lot of modern art museums, and whenever I visit a new city that's what I make a beeline for. I love modern art museums — most of the work in them is crap, but there will always be a few pieces that blow me out of the water, more than any classical art piece. Yves Klein, Meret Oppenheim, and Mark Tansey are some of my favourite artists.\r\n* Tweaking my personal style! I'm trying to grow it in a slightly more masc and formal direction currently. I have Strong Opinions about some fashion bloggers. I am currently on the hunt for the perfect pair of loafers. I secured some weejuns, now I’m looking for some nice tailored button ups.\r\n* Practicing decorative arts — I do some cross stitch, embroidery, sashiko, sewing, and crochet. It's fun, I like customizing my belongings, and it's nice to be able to make tiny gifts for my friends on a whim.\r\n* Dabbling a bit in digital art, just to create some rationality merch that I am actually willing to wear on my body. That's been going pretty okay, and it's great that Midjourney can generate me infinite reference photos.\r\n* Trying to get into movies more. It's a neat art form. I’m especially into documentaries about very specific people or events that I wouldn’t otherwise know about unless I was in some sort of specific subculture, such as Crumb (1994) and Battle at Versailles (2016); if you have recs please send them my way!!!\r\nLetting the soft animal of my body love what it loves\r\n* Splurging on a big bag of jumbo cherries every week when it's in season\r\n* Stopping frequently on bike trips when the clouds are dramatic, just to look my fill\r\n* Reacquainting myself with the nu-metal bands that I loved in middle school. This is the good shit.\r\n* Going through the IGF finalists every year and picking up the games that I think I might love.\r\n* Cycling through a dozen casual hobbies unrepentantly\r\n* A very specific genre of poetry that makes me feel fuzzy inside. This poem’s my favourite.\r\n* Letting myself dance even though I have zero coordination and bodily awareness. I was once called “the wiggliest dancer at the rave”\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] I have the tiniest bit of experience with HTML and CSS from playing Neopets a bunch in third grade, but literally nothing more than that\r\n________________\r\nAppendix 2: Additional Pictures of Me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMe and the gang rejecting a terrible message in an art museum; me in a cardigan I made\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMost of my pics of myself are like these ones, taken after I've corralled my friends into taking a nice picture to celebrate and mark just being together. I'm not big on social media, but I figure the us-es of 2040 would appreciate these little tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nA few miscellaneous shots.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAppendix 3: Testimonial\r\n\r\n\r\nJenn and I dated through university and remain good friends to this day. Sometimes I think about how I've changed and grown in that time, and many threads that I'm proud of trace right back to her. It was genuinely transformative to spend a few years experiencing Jenn's unique blend of compassion, intelligence, and will to point those things at making the world a better place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow she low-key pulled this on me even though we were just having an enjoyable time cuddling, playing various games into the wee hours of the morning, throwing interesting parties for our friends, slinging internet longform at each other, and just generally having a great time. I'm still not sure how she managed that one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, we were young and dumb then, and she's even cooler now somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, 10/10, great person, would recommend deliberately spending a lot of time around."

I am content with myself and I strive to correct any part of myself that is in misalignment with what’s best for me/others/all. I started that process at 18 years old, and now I am 34, as of July 13 2024. What I am seeking to create with someone is very specific. If I remove everything that I would like off the table and keep just one thing, it would be this, that what we create together is a level of conversation and understanding of each other, to the deepest levels possible, and break that limit. This is what I am saying right now. The goal for me is not love, and not to escape the horrors of the world. I am seeking deeper understanding of myself, and of the mind, so that I can use that understanding to better.\nI am not sharing my location or real name. I am aware I am different, so I try to take some measure of respect.\nI am not sharing photos because photos are deceiving. I really don’t care about appearance. You can have the most beautiful woman in front of me and I wouldn’t care. Just look how you want to look. Obviously, within the principle of what’s best for all, we have to take care of ourselves, our bodies, to make sure that we are strong.\nIf you are looking for physical attraction, then I am not interested. If you want to explore effective sex, then know that I have achieved easy multi orgasms, which is part of not stimulating the mind, and instead working directly with the physical experience.\nI can write out pages of my positive attributes. And I can write out all of my experiences and perspectives. I believe that above though is already weird enough to dissuade most people.\nworkefficient777@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿Dave  \r\nSan Diego, California\r\ndavidabarak@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been divorced since March, 2021, and I'm thankful that it was a drama-free event. My ex-wife is a good woman but we just drifted apart. I've done a lot of work on myself since then, and I have a good handle on the things I did wrong. If I get a second chance at love, I'll know how to make it work.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the divorce and my retirement that followed soon after, I really began to examine my life. It turns out I'm not the center of the universe after all! Okay, I wasn't really that self-centered, but I did realize that my greatest rewards come from service to others, whether it's working to be a better partner and friend, volunteering, or just doing simple things that might make someone's day just a little nicer. Compassion, kindness, generosity, awareness, gratitude, honesty, humility and even that trait some guys don't understand - vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing open to life and living fearlessly are part of my new outlook. One example: I recently began bodyboarding (\"boogey boarding\"), and not long ago I had a magical experience - I was surrounded by dolphins as they fed, some as close as 10 feet away. One rose up out of the water to take a look at me. I was the closest human by quite a bit; everyone else was a couple of hundred feet away or more. That put a smile on my face and laughter in my heart for two full days. It felt like a personal gift from the universe. You can't experience life if you don't show up for it.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a term I heard recently - ambivert. It describes someone who has the traits of both an extrovert and introvert. It seems to describe me, although I lean a little toward extroversion. I volunteer as a docent at a very popular local museum, so I get to be part tour guide, part educator and part entertainer. It's perfect for me, and I come away with a sense of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a glass half-full kind of guy. Sure, sometimes the level drops a little below the halfway mark - I'm human - but more often the glass is almost overflowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not religious but I'm trying to find my way spiritually. (There's a story about how I came to finally acknowledge my spiritual side, something I kept suppressed for decades.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI've got a pretty sharp sense of humor (or at least I think so), but I know how to rein it in so I don't offend people. I don't take myself too seriously. Sometimes I wake up laughing.

Being in a romantic relationship isn't a one-way thing for me - I want to give at least as much as I get.

      "fullText": "﻿Meta: this doc is oriented toward a long term romantic relationship. I’m also open to more “casual” possibilities, but if that’s what you’re after you should probably ignore this doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was 11 years old, as my 12th birthday was approaching, I noticed that the people younger than me tended to have grand ambitions - going to space or becoming president or, in my case, building a new continent. But the people older than me generally did not have such ambitions. Clearly something happened to nearly everyone as they got older, such that they gave up on their dreams and decided to get married, buy a house and have 2.5 kids instead. I was terrified that would happen to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I swore very hard never to do that - never to embrace a life of mediocrity. And that basically worked.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a cure for aging. I want weekend trips to the moon. I want flying cars and an indestructible body and tiny genetically-engineered dragons. I want to understand minds, be able to build them and edit them and read off their internals. I want things well beyond humanity’s current bounds, and the focus of my life is pursuing those goals wherever they may lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I also want - very badly - is a partner for that pursuit. And I do mean a partner - not a hanger-on, not an enthusiastic supporter, but someone with grand ambitions of their own and capabilities on par with my own or perhaps even greater. I want someone who can actually be a peer in pushing beyond humanity’s current abilities. Because that is what I need, in order to feel romantic love; nothing else seems to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n… and that’s it. There’s lots of little things I could say - I am sadly quite straight, I love dancing, etc, etc… but I’ve said the part which matters most and I don’t want to water it down further. If a partnership of pushing beyond humanity’s current abilities and making the world more to our tastes is something you want, you should get in touch and we can find out if we’re a good fit along other axes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to scope me out, I write a lot on LessWrong. A message on LessWrong is the most expedient way to get in touch if we don’t already have another channel; Facebook or the myriad of slack spaces also work if our social circles overlap already."

They usually involve conversing on a wide variety of topics and sometimes playing board games.\r\n* I’m a, mostly non-practicing, Buddhist.\r\n* I have an undergraduate degree in physics.\r\n* I’m an anaclitic thinker and tend to over think things.\r\n* I enjoy conversations on philosophy, science, history, law, sociology, and many other topics.\r\n* I am open minded and tolerant of opinions on which I disagree.\r\n* I am teetotal.  I don’t drink, smoke, or do recreational drugs.  I’m okay with my partner drinking on occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho am I looking for?\r\n* I am looking for a 27-57 year old of any gender.\r\n* I would like to find a fellow nerd.\r\n* I am looking for a long term partner and potentially a life partner.\r\n* I value honesty, intelligence, independence, and humor in a romantic partner.\r\n* I would appreciate someone who could challenge me.\r\n* I have a preference for someone who is open minded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for in a relationship?\r\n* I am looking for someone to spend time with and build a life with.\r\n* I am okay with not having children.  I am willing to consider raising children.  I do not want to be the biological father of children but would consider adoption, fostering, making use of a sperm bank, or helping to raise someone else’s child.\r\n* I am willing to try new things.\r\n* I am looking for an intellectual and emotional connection.\r\n* I am happy with a more relaxed relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat type of relationship am I looking for?\r\n* I’m happy with a monogamous relationship.  I’m open to considering a non-monogamous relationship but I would be looking for a primary partner in such a setup.\r\n* I desire a relationship where we do things together but it is also okay if we do things apart.  This might be socializing without the other partner present or time for individual activities.\r\n* Sex is not important for me in a relationship but it is desired.  I am willing to partner with someone who wants to wait to have sex and potentially never wants to have sex.  My preference is to have a physical relationship once we get to know each other well enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I provide in a relationship?\r\n* I can provide emotional and social support to a partner.\r\n* I am told that I am a good listener.  I try to always ask if someone wants me to just listen or if they want feedback when they want me to listen.\r\n* I am someone who is not afraid to challenge his partner.\r\n* I can promise to be available to provide emotional, intellectual, physical, or logistical assistance in dealing with life’s problems.\r\n* I am rather domestic.  I enjoy cooking and cleaning.  I do not enjoy yard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there any potential roadblocks?\r\n* I sometimes need some time for myself.\r\n* I am a leftist and a Buddhist.  I am okay with dating someone who has a different political and/or religious ideology than me but these might be important for other people.\r\n* I regularly attend mental health therapy.  My issues limit my ability to work and I apparently cannot work a full time job.  I have my mental health under control for the most part so I would not be needing much support here but my struggles are a part of who I am.\r\n* Some people might find me lacking in ambition.  I am not looking for a prestigious career, or to make lots of money, or to be in charge of things.\r\n* I find routines comfortable.  I have a weekly schedule where I have this for dinner this night, I go to the store this day, etc.  I can sometimes become attached to a comfortable routine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does one contact me and is there anything else?\r\n* I check my e-mail, schwabbenjamin@gmail.com, at-least once a day and usually multiple times a day.\r\n* I am not willing to relocate for a relationship that is just starting.  I am willing to relocate for a relationship that is well established and looks like it could last.\r\n* I live on my own in a two bedroom condo that I own outright.  I am willing to upgrade my living situation if a relationship advances far enough.  I prefer to live in a condo or townhome as opposed to a single family house.\r\n* I like animals though I currently don’t have any pets."

      "fullText": "﻿How’s it going? I’m Destiny!\r\n29 | female | 5’3” | Naples, FL (For Now)\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I am a big-hearted nerd looking for a match who is kind, funny, and loves stories.  \r\n* I am a published author of middle grade novels, audio dramas, and TTRPG content (writing is my main passion in case it’s not obvious). I’m also a lawyer, but I don’t practice currently.  \r\n* I am on the asexual spectrum and looking for someone to form a connection with rather than jumping straight to physical intimacy. Taking it slow is important to me.  \r\n* I’m a pescatarian (minus shellfish) but that’s more a taste thing, not a moral stance. \r\n* I am currently in Naples, Florida but don’t plan to be here indefinitely. Just waiting for the right opportunity to spur a move.\r\n* I am very open to starting out long distance. Some of my closest friendships started online. \r\n* Jump down to the bottom of the doc for pictures.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n* Kids: I’m not interested in having kids, biological or adopted. \r\n* Age Range: I am looking for a guy who is in the 25-35 age range. \r\n* Conservative Politics: Although I’m not overly political in my day to day life, my values don’t align with conservative politics and it’s important to me that whoever I date shares my values. \r\n* Hardcore Atheism: I was raised Christian and still consider myself Christian (though in a much less legalistic and much more acceptance and love thy neighbor kind of way). Though I don’t need my partner to share my exact beliefs, I’d prefer someone who is baseline spiritual, even if agnostic.\r\n* Smoking/Excessive Drinking: I don’t smoke or drink. Casual drinking is fine but I don’t like the smell of smoke.  \r\n* Polyamory: I am 100% monogamous. \r\n* Cats: I don’t have anything against cats and in fact I like them a lot. I’m just allergic to them unfortunately :( \r\nThings I Love \r\n* TTRPGs: I am never playing as many TTRPGs as I’d like so, to supplement, I watch a bunch of actual plays. My current favorites are Dimension 20 (especially Fantasy High), Worlds Beyond Number, and NADDPOD. \r\n* Theme Parks: I grew up in Florida so I usually went to Orlando at least once a year and I’ve kept the love of theme parks into adulthood. I love roller coasters (even though I can be a total baby about getting on them). The last one that really wowed me was Mako at SeaWorld. The airtime on the hills was amazing! \r\n* Escape Rooms: I am such a huge sucker for riddles and puzzles and there is not a secret tunnel in the world that I don’t want to fling myself into with reckless abandon. It’s the closest to a real-life point and click game that you can get and I love it. There’s one in Baton Rouge called 13th Gate Escape that I’ve been dying to check out. I’ve heard it’s like the Disney of escape rooms! \r\n* Musical Theater: I lived in NYC for three years and the best part (besides the subway which I miss so much) was Broadway proximity. Some of my favorite shows are She Loves Me, Little Shop of Horrors, Six, Legally Blonde, Phantom, Ride the Cyclone, Matilda, Nerdy Prudes Must Die, and Hamilton. It hasn’t been staged yet but I’m also really enjoying Epic as it releases! And the single best musical episode of a TV show hands down is Once More With Feeling from Buffy (though Subspace Rhapsody in ST: Strange New Worlds is the best one in a long while).  \r\n* Travel: I love to travel but I don’t love solo travel so I haven’t gotten to do nearly as much as I’d like. I’ve been to the UK and Spain while studying abroad and Australia for my bar trip. I’ve also been to Jamaica (where my parents are from) and several other Caribbean islands. I’d really love to go back to Europe to hit some of the countries I missed and Japan is my current big ticket dream location. \r\nFive…\r\n* Movies I Love: Enchanted, Shrek 2, Into the Spiderverse, Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, The Mummy\r\n* TV Shows I Love: Pushing Daisies, The Bear, Community, Frasier, Star Trek (TNG, VOY, DS9, LD, SNW)\r\n* Video Games I Love: Slay the Spire, Hades, Return to Monkey Island, Chicory, Tunic \r\n* Childhood Favorite Books: Ella Enchanted, Holes, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, The Lightning Thief, Dealing with Dragons\r\n* Non D&D TTRPGs I Love: Kids on Bikes/Brooms, Dread, Tales from the Loop, Perils & Princesses, Mausritter \r\nVibe Check Me\r\n* My Goodreads: I tend to read a lot of middle grade both because I like it and because I write it. \r\n* An Actual Play I Guest GM’d: Watch me wrangle a group of princesses as they make (delightful) choices I never anticipated coming up when I wrote the module. \r\n* My itch.io Page: Check out some of my side projects. \r\nThink We Might Be a Good Match? \r\n* Feel free to shoot me an email at serendipitousfox37@gmail.com with some info about yourself and some pics.\r\n* If you don’t think we’d be a good match but you know someone who you think might, absolutely feel free to forward them this profile.\r\n* Also feel free to email me if you want to talk about Dimension 20. I always want to be talking about Dimension 20 :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures of Me\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n________________\r\n    ________________"

      "fullText": "﻿Just a girl looking for someone to do the big shop with.\r\n \r\nI’m Lou, a 36 year old from sleepy suburbia casually looking for the Tom to my Barbara.\r\n \r\nThis could be us…\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n The basics:\r\n \r\n·          I’m based on the Surrey/Hants/Berks border (near Guildford, Reading etc)\r\n·          Single, no kids\r\n·          Monogamous\r\n·          Social drinker, no smoking or drugs\r\n·          Liberal-leaning & atheist\r\n·          Dog owner (she’s a massive flirt.  You’ll like her.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nA little context:\r\n \r\nMy last serious relationship lasted a whopping 11 years, and I’ve spent the past couple of years since then enjoying some solo time, focusing on personal growth and rediscovering old passions, with dating generally taking a backseat.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nI’m someone who has always been very independent and at this stage in my life I have the luxury of meeting all of my own material needs.  I’m not looking for a man to put a ring on my finger, to give me children, or to bump one another up the property ladder. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for is much more elusive!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a man I can call my home.  Someone to grow old with, to experience the euphoric highs of life with, and to soften the lows.  I’m someone who experiences the world with a degree of childlike wonder and awe, and I’m looking for someone with a similarly curious nature, who finds joy in the little things, has an optimistic and upbeat outlook, and an exceptional capacity for kindness, empathy and human connection.  We’ll travel, share new experiences, surround ourselves with a network of mutual friends and build a fulfilling life together. With a dog.  Or three. \r\n\r\n\r\nI consider myself an extroverted introvert, so whilst I’m a good conversationalist I like to balance social events with plenty of quiet time and prefer small groups/1-1 to big parties.  I’m equal-parts open book & intensely private, and I tend to be quite direct and unselfconscious, which has its pros and cons in dating.  I can be a bit of a pleasure-seeker and I believe it’s perfectly ok to outsource things outside of your skillset to others if you have the means to do it (cough, shall we get a gardener, cough?)  \r\n \r\nA few things I love:\r\n \r\n·          Reading - I have a mountain of books piled up by my bed and I generally get through a couple a month.  I particularly enjoy fiction written by women about the female experience but I also love most novels set in the Middle East.  My favourite read of 2024 so far is “Her Side of the Story” by Alba de Cespedes, and my favourite book of all time is The Stray Cats of Homs by Eva Nour.  I’m also a member of a non-fiction book club and we cover everything from neuroscience to mental health, travel, social causes and psychology.  I love the idea of reading a book in tandem with a partner so we can discuss it together.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          Theatre – I genuinely believe it’s the closest thing to real magic a person can experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          The water – My happy place is on or in the water.  Swimming, surfing, kayaking…I can proudly say my Dryrobe gets used for its original purpose, and not just as an outdoor Oodie.  Once or twice a year I chuck the dog in the back of the car and drive to Devon or Cornwall for some vitamin sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          The arts – This Spring I managed to get my hands on the new Fujifilm X100 and I’ve had a huge amount of fun recreating an analogue aesthetic and generally being a brat trying to snap candid photos of friends and family after they’ve just taken a massive mouthful of cake.  I’m interested in Brutalist and Bauhaus architecture, art, sculpture and contemporary poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          The outdoors – you won’t find me dragging you up Snowdon every weekend, but I’m definitely looking for a partner who shares my love of being outside.  I have a gorgeous sighthound, so long countryside walks are a big part of our day and a failsafe way to win her over.  More generally speaking, I love to eat al-fresco, cosy up in a pub garden under a blanket and discover new rambles on the AllTrails app. \r\n\r\n\r\n·          Good food – I want to know all the recommendations!  Where’s your favourite place for fresh pastries?  Or that local Nepalese gem that no one else knows about?  I bought my first pasta maker this year and now tortellini is my entire personality.\r\n \r\nAbout you:\r\n \r\nLet’s start with the non-negotiables.\r\n \r\n·          Aged 30-44\r\n·          Ideally based in the South East.  If in London, you should be happy to share time outside the city.\r\n·          Monogamous\r\n·          I’m leaning towards staying child-free, so it’s important that you either don’t want them, or are indifferent to them.  It’s fine if you already have them, though!\r\n·          No heavy-drinkers and no drug users\r\n·          Dog lover essential.  She’s part of the family and will be joining us on many of our adventures. \r\n·          You take pride in your ability to maintain your home and can cook.  \r\n \r\nThe rest…\r\n \r\nI’m a balanced person who tends to operate in lots of shades of grey.  I don’t tend to be attracted towards extremes and I generally prefer a more measured personality.  \r\n \r\nI find myself leaning into people who are comfortable showing vulnerability.  Intelligent people with a calm aura, who enjoy thinking a question through before they answer it, and who are secure in their sense of self and what they have to offer the world.  My personal brand of humour is dry and silly as opposed to lots of “banter” or loud jokes, but there’s no accounting for chemistry, right?\r\n \r\nYou’re passionate about your interests, quietly confident, an excellent conversationalist and sociable, but a little clumsy with it…  If you’ve ever said “love you, bye!” before hanging up on your boss and silently dying inside, I’ll probably find that sexy. \r\n \r\n·          You’re a successful professional (in any field) and financially secure.  I love a healthy-mix of wholesome low-key dates with the odd boujie restaurant and overpriced cocktail bar thrown in.  Ideally you’ll be comfortable enough that you can join me for things like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re not a workaholic.  It seems to be a badge of honour these days to be building the next Fortune 500 company with eleventy-billion side-hustles on the go, but I’m looking for someone who’s generous with their time and attention.  Ambition and drive are hot, but not at the expense of your personal relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\n·          You enjoy a mix of city & country.  I live semi-rurally and my weekends are full of trips to the farm shop, National Trust days, market towns and walks by the river followed by a coffee or glass of red.  My perfect date is a day at RHS Wisley to see the Autumn colours changing followed by dinner somewhere with a view.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re present in the moment and value real-world experiences.  You’re not addicted to social media, porn or gaming. \r\n\r\n\r\n·          You like to stay healthy and fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re romantic and enjoy caring for others.  Thoughtful gestures, remembering things they said they liked and little acts of service come naturally to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          It matters to you that you’re a good son, brother, uncle, friend, neighbour etc.  You value community and your personal relationships are important.  You’re welcoming and inclusive of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re kind and gracious in an argument.  You’re open-minded, accepting of others’ views, and happy to be challenged on your own.  You don’t think you know it all, you can admit when you’re wrong, and you’re open to compromise.  You are tolerant of those whose political or social views may differ from yours and can engage in debate while keeping things light and playful.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re a supportive partner who would view the two of us as our own little family unit, with or without children.  You’re open to creating our own celebrations and traditions and are looking for someone to grow something exciting and meaningful with, making our own rules along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You have an adventurous streak and enjoy trying new activities and generally broadening your horizons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe prospect of meeting someone special is exhilarating but the whole online dating thing leaves me cold, so I figure why not inject a little old-school romance into the equation?  If you think we could be a good match (or you know someone who might!), take a tip from Tom Hanks and let me know why at datemelou@yahoo.com.  Better yet, send me suggestions for potential dates and fun things you think we’d both enjoy, and don’t forget to include a photo!"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi.  Thanks for reading my info.  My name is Brian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a 57-year old white male living in the Phoenix area.  I have a background in IT and a graduate degree. I’m 6’1” and about 210. I seek femme or androgynous-presenting people of any gender and prefer smart, engaged and self-aware types. I look for a connection & serious chemistry with someone before I can really get into a relationship.  It’s that tangible vibe that I can’t ignore and can’t make up.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am nonbinary and genderfluid; some might say ‘genderchaotic’.  This does not mean I cross dress.  I am just not interested in being a masculine male in attitude or look and it’s much easier to just go with what looks and feels good to me and often it’s black.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm an INFJ-T so fairly loner-ish, a Sigma and 6w5 Enneatype.  I like my own company when I am not partnered but tend to focus on the person I'm with when that applies.  I prefer small groups where I can talk to interesting people and don't particularly care for big, noisy venues.  I'm extremely well-read and look for the same in a relationship - show me your library. One of the main aspects of my personality is an obsession with the esoteric, the metaphysical, the unusual and hidden.  This extends to physical and emotional intimacy.  I want a deep, visceral reaction when I look at my partner and vice versa.  We should know what the other is thinking across a crowded room with just a look and feel a need to be touching and affectionate no matter the circumstances.  QAF. Curiosity, exploration, openness, desire and heat - if you resonate with “Take Me to Church” by Hozier, that captures the feeling I have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not reading or pursuing these things I'm listening to podcasts, sometimes working on novels or nonfiction research projects or watching documentaries. I play videogames and spend time in Second Life.  I have done some virtual photography and found it very soothing and creative.  I like to hand-bind journals when I have time.  I enjoy target shooting but am not a hunter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a smart woman of any gender, 40 and up, who knows herself but wants to dig deeper.  I like those who are mentally strong, who have survived some of the rough experiences life can provide and come back stronger.  I tend to be attracted to tomboys and transwomen who look good in jeans and a tank top and I'm wild for ink and piercings. I like curves, whether they are natural thickness or muscles.  If you speak multiple languages or ASL I'd love to learn, ditto with anything else you're good at and obsessed with. I seek someone similar who is focused on their spiritual development and the search for knowledge and understanding. I want to find someone who is in touch with all aspects of themselves and not put off by the shadow.  Physically I am often drawn to women with a high melanin content but I'm open to anyone with whom I connect.  I'm not a monotheist and I lean way left politically. I would do best with someone of like persuasion who is open-minded, tolerant, progressive and spiritually attuned.  Bonus points if you are into Star Wars, particularly those who run around with red lightsabers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd really like to meet someone in the Phoenix area but I'm open to travel and potential relocation if the vibe is right.  I'd consider anything more or less in the Western US.  I'm a monogamous person though I would consider a closed throuple with the right pair.  I want to meet someone who first and foremost gets me just as I am, accepts me where I'm at and respects my wants and needs as I will surely do the same in return.  I'm housebroken, responsible, employed and live on my own.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this resonates with you, send me your bat sign…  bhodges209@gmail.com."

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me Doc: Steven Elleman\r\nFeel free to send questions, feedback, snark, love letters, etc to steven.elleman@gmail.com . \r\n\r\n\r\nThe intent of this doc is to put some basic facts about myself online. If these facts feel aligned, then reach out. Some folks have reached out to say this kind of doc “spoils the mystery”. To me, the mystery is our emergent dynamic. It is what uniquely arises from us, what dance we co-create. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe previous version of this doc was aggressively autistic, feel free to check it out if you like walls of text: Date Me Doc: Steven Elleman (old)\r\nAbout Me \r\nI worked as a professional software engineer for 7 years, I quit last year to try to align my main life threads into one coherent braid. There are three threads in my life: (1) communal living, (2) secular religious exploration, and (3) “DWeb”. \r\n\r\n\r\n(1) matters to me because there’s magic to communal living that has made my life so much richer, and I want family in a communal context. (2) is about my relationship with myself and relationship with others. The magic that (1) offers feels like the right environment for (2), and I’ve been exploring different secular religious communities and running experimental retreats. (3) is a technical movement about a bottom-up version of the Internet and our digital world. I think (1) is the right vehicle for (3). Communal living is all about navigating shared resources and infrastructure; adding home servers into the mix makes a lot of sense. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat unifies these threads is simple: home. If I had a home with a community of people I deeply admire and love I think that’d satisfy most of my needs. I’m interested in building a new kind of home from the bottom up, one that makes sense to me. This is both the simplest and grandest kind of endeavor, creating my own community-home is a constant act of world-building. I long for a partner-lover-friend who wants to build it with me.\r\nRomantic Dynamic \r\nI build intimacy slowly. Using the body as a metaphor, I build intimacy through head -> gut -> heart -> sex. Head: on an intellectual level I need to think we have aligned values and goals. Gut: I need to feel safe with you, that you’re a stable, reliable, and integrous person. Only after my head and gut feel safe do my internal inhibitions drop, and I feel permissioned to fall in love. And only after that do I feel permissioned to feel sexual attraction. My story for this order and degree of inhibition is that I fear being trapped in a partnership similar to my parents – if I’m going to be committed I need to feel deeply aligned. Typically the way I build intimacy is through shared projects and lots of talking or writing. Romantically so far my pattern has been heterosexual and serially monogamous, and I would like to be a father.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeologically I subscribe to “relational presence”; I believe relationships of all kinds should honor whatever is present and alive, over stories of the relationship. What does a shared commitment to presence and aliveness look like? When stories are prioritized, feelings can be repressed out of a sense of responsibility or obligation. This is putting the cart before the horse. It’s putting intellectual stories over feelings which often represent a deeper and more embodied truth. In rational positivist thinking, the intellect trumps subjectivity and feelings. I believe this perceived superiority is at the root of many contemporary problems; it amounts to gaslighting. Feelings are facts. If feelings are facts, they’re always valid and legitimate. All wants, desires, fears, aversions, boundaries, etc are first-class citizens; stories must follow from the feelings, the cart must follow the horse. This allows radical honesty and transparency, eliminates unhealthy shame and repression, and ensures stories are constantly brought back into alignment with what’s actually being felt, what’s actually present and alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stories we tell often feel rooted in a desire for safety and control, fear of loss can prevent relationships from changing in necessary and beautiful ways. I see possession in conventional monogamous relationships as an attempt to prevent change and loss; in the process it puts the cart before the horse, it can put the story of the relationship before appreciation of what’s real. Loss is inevitable. People change. We’re going to die. I want to feel safe in the impermanence and change. Beyond acceptance of loss is savoring the preciousness of life. Denial of impermanence prevents savoring, it leads to clinging to stories and grasping for control that simply doesn’t exist. It leads to attachment to a story or image of self and partner over who they actually are, and in the process, aliveness is stifled, and self-deception takes over. \r\n\r\n\r\nI want to see and know you as you are, and I want to be seen and known in turn. I want to honor you in your full aliveness, and even if it’s brief and fleeting, at least it’ll be real. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis belief has been shifting all my relationships pretty significantly over the last year, and I’m still seeing how it coalesces with my historical romantic dynamic. \r\nRomantic Archetypes \r\nThere appear to be recurring archetypes that I’m drawn to. “Autistic” – women who emphasize intellect, principles, analytical reasoning – I feel safe with this archetype and there’s a shared interest in systems and reasoning. “Post-Rock Bottom” – women who had to go through emotional turbulence and have hit rock bottom before – I admire the resilience and acceptance of this archetype, often it has emotional depth and contrast, which I love. I often like being a “ground” for my partner and seem to be attracted to depressive and bipolar women – I like being a source of hope, optimism, care. “Shamanic” – I often like women who marry a high degree of sensitivity, attunement and intuition with spirituality. “Fiery” – I want a warrior. I like strong women. Beneath my outer layers of personality is a lot of fire. I’ve noticed I like women who are fierce, I know I can handle them, and I want them to be able to handle me. I can like the “Brat” archetype – I like being of service, but I like taking control in other contexts – some brattiness can strike a nice balance.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re some combination of Fiery Post-Rock Bottom Shamanic Autist Brat please reach out!"

      "fullText": "﻿Daryna’s Date Me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBackground\r\nUkrainian, living in Germany since 2015. I moved here for studies (rationally) and due to my late childhood memories of calm, clean cities and sporty, smiling people (emotionally). I've also lived in China and the States, so I’m fairly used to fitting my life into two (largely overweight) suitcases. I was supposed to move to Stuttgart but stayed in Berlin (mainly because my paintings no longer fit into those two suitcases).\r\nLanguages: German, English, Russian. Any of them goes, but I feel less witty in German.\r\nLocation: Berlin, DE. I previously couldn’t imagine myself moving elsewhere, but now that has changed, and I would switch cities for new experiences and to shake things up.\r\nHow I see myself: Emotional, curious, creative, extremely stubborn.\r\nHow my close friends/family see me: ‘She is kind, ambitious, self-reflective, and gives good advice. But beware of the girl, she’s an avid hoarder’ (the ‘avid hoarder’ part was probably about the amount of art supplies I own, haha).\r\nWho I am not: Never say never, but I’m not a party/club person. I feel comfortable around big numbers people at conferences and events at work but prefer smaller groups and dialogues in my private life. The quality of conversation matters to me. And the clubs nowadays don’t even play Britney Spears songs, so why would you want to go anyway, right?\r\nLW/EA community: This is how I came across the concept of a date-me-doc but wouldn’t expect any other approach from the rationalists. My approach towards charity and rationalism grew naturally till I found out that it is in tune with a large community out there. I would like to engage with it more on a regular basis since I agree that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\r\nRandom facts: I was part of a girls' band in high school. I put salt on top of sweet foods (ice cream, chocolate, porridge, etc.). My guinea pig was a centenarian (by animal measures, 8 years = 144 years) and had a collection of hand-made dresses, made out of socks and rhinestones  🎀 \r\n\r\n\r\nMy everyday life\r\nWork: I identify a lot through what I do, so my profession is worth a mention. I am an architect and an interior designer who is currently transitioning into the field of tattooing. I've been painting since I was little and previously used to sell my art. I paint with oils and digitally, also experimenting a lot with charcoal and ink.\r\nBooks: I usually read up to 5 books simultaneously, mostly sci-fi, dystopias, biographies, and non-fiction on society, economics, and psychology. I also love myths and fairytales of various nations. Currently, I'm relaxing my reading muscle and enjoying a fantasy book series from my childhood about a boy who was given ancient powers to rule Hell and his controversial journey to find Heaven.\r\nMusic: I really enjoy silence, to be honest. I am not much of a ‘music playing in the background all day long’ kind of person unless it's something repetitive like lo-fi. When I sit and listen to music, it’s usually some indie rock, hip-hop, classical, or jazz music. I am very unspoiled as far as the quality of the equipment, like sound systems or record players, goes, so feel free to teach me a thing or two about it.\r\nSports: Mostly yoga, pilates, and gym. I’ve had a quite bad knee injury and have been taking it slow since then. I would love to try more group sports and hiking in the future.\r\nActivities: Painting/sketching, photographing, singing. Redesigning my apartment for the 100th time, helping friends redesign their apartments for the 100th time, treasure hunting for new lampshades at thrift stores. Repotting my astonishingly fast-growing basil plants.\r\nWhere you can usually find me: Bookstores, vintage markets, parks, theaters, cinemas, somewhere in the streets (I walk a lot), or at home enjoying my afternoon beauty sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\nLove language: All of them matter, but I would pick Physical Touch and Acts of Service as my main ones. With Physical Touch being one of the things you can almost exclusively get in a romantic relationship, it is a very important feature for me. While Acts of Service show the invisible care, and I like their casual subtlety.\r\nStyle: Monogamous, long-term. Committed, honest, intimate, caring, romantic.\r\nLooking for: A kind, reliable, emotionally mature, ambitious person with a strong set of values they stand by.\r\nKids: For me, the partner comes first, and children are negotiable. I am looking for a person with whom I could share this experience, but having kids is not the main goal of a relationship. I want someone I know I can safely rely on while bearing and raising a child, sharing this responsibility together.\r\nSidenotes: I don’t drink/smoke/take drugs, so would prefer a partner with no habitual substance abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou made it to the end of this document! Feel free to contact me @silxxdar on Telegram or share this doc with anyone who you think would be a great match for me, thank you."

It would be nice to cook together with my partner\r\n* I have a good sense of humour, and am childlike\r\n* I'm smart and would like my partner to be way (ideally one more big 'WAY') smarter than me and teach me anything\r\n* Very cliche but I like watching films, listening to music, reading books…trying to get back into more creative hobbies like writing, drawing, singing, playing the ukulele, craft etc\r\n* I love cycling, swimming, and dance aerobics, and am pretty stoic about regular exercise and health routines - I’m very organised, independent and disciplined\r\n* I’m the kind of person who NEVER FAILS to pet a cat on the street, or always tries to rescue snails when they’re on the street\r\n* I love enjoying nice food (just tasty, doesn’t have to be fancy. In fact, my favourite kind of food is free food) and it’s very important to me that I can share that enjoyment with my partner\r\n* As you can see, I’m very autistic honest and transparent\r\n* I'm reasonable and able to change my views based on evidence. I apologise for my actions if I made any mistake. I might argue to understand and reach an agreement if there's a relationship problem, but I don't fight.\r\n* *In 2024, I moved from Camden (central London) to Milton Keynes (30 min train from London Euston) where there’s more green and is quieter. I live alone in a house full of plants with Toffin, and there are a bunch of cows 10 minutes walk away which I’m making friends with :)\r\n🌳What I’m looking for:\r\n* Companionship based on trust and deep friendship where we help each other grow and be a better version of ourselves, and be happy together. We respect each other's space and also enjoy each other's company. We feel truly safe and free to be ourselves.\r\n* Although I loved living in a big city where a community of friends are walking distance away, and I also want to travel around the world, at this point in life (how many years have we got before the AGI?), I want to live in the countryside with a big, beautiful garden with a bunch of animals. I would like a partner who would want to share that quiet, peaceful life mindfully, enjoying each other’s company and tiny little things nature would grant us each day\r\n* Having said that, I think I’d be pretty happy to not cohabitate as well - just meeting up regularly and keeping in touch, giving each other plenty of space\r\n* From my experience (most recent relationship lasted for 8 year) someone with below characteristics will probably work well with me:\r\n   * Very patient\r\n   * Very stable (not much emotional fluctuations towards negative direction in particular)\r\n   * Who is capable of loving someone deeply\r\n   * Very smart and knowledgeable\r\n   * Kind and caring\r\n   * Practices mindfulness/meditation and has basic understanding of psychology and philosophy in general, as well as communication (NVC, IFS etc)\r\n   * Has a great sense of humour\r\n   * Still avoids covid and wear a mask indoors, or is willing to avoid it for me (I certainly don’t need Long Covid on top of what I already have)\r\n   * Willing to communicate and be honest and transparent\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading! If you think you might get along with me, please don’t hesitate to contact me at chiakimizuta61@gmail.com or pass this to that weird friend of yours :) If you want a reference, my ex (who is now my best friend; we still have a great relationship, just no longer romantic. He moved to Berkeley so don’t fret) is happy to vouch for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLast Updated: 20/11/2025"

I'm from Connecticut. I’m adventurous. I like to travel - but I like to travel for ideas. I don’t care that much about money - but I do like to make money? I’m not sure about that one way or the other.\nI think I’m kind, interesting and thoughtful. I’m 5’9” or 5’10”? I like to keep my hair messy. And I wear a lot of interesting hoodies.  I have a law degree from Oxford. An undergraduate classics degree from UConn. I spend most of my time programming or doing law or walking.\n(Oh looking to date  - then see if you are interested in getting married - and I want to have children)\nIdeas\nI’m atheist, but I think in another time period, I would have been religious. I have had a number of different periods in my life when I was gripped by ideas. First, it was classics. Then, it was law (especially contract law). Then, it was computers. Now, it’s AI and machine learning. I talk about the ideas that I like pretty constantly. I tell a lot of jokes.\nWhat I really want to know are your interests! And, I want you to share them with me. I want to be with someone that wants to share their observations with me.\nLove Style\nI really like physical touch and to hold hands. I want someone that I can spend a lot of my time with as the relationship progresses. I really have very few demands. I like to let me partner live out their goals. But, I like my partner to let me live out mine. I’m small “c” conservative (so, monogamous). I’m thoughtful - but low key. I also try my best.\nPrevious partners have described me as “kind”, “thoughtful”, “gentle”, “honest” and “adventurous”. My most successful relationships have been with girls that were like me (not in a background sense but in a love style and ideas and career sense).\nI’ve also been described as “playful”.\nCareer etc…\nI’ve never had trouble with career but my career has been super unusual. I went from legal assistant to Chief Compliance Officer at a 2k person company. There is a whole story there. The company went public. I then took 2 years off. Then was first employee as Chief Product Officer at a Regulatory AI company. I just quit.\nI think about my career a lot - but I min-max for ideas. I don’t think anyone should worry about whether I have a provider mindset - I don’t - but I make up the difference by being highly performant and knowing what I want - and the things I want have always been highly remunerated.\nPhilosophy\nI’m not a rationalist. I honestly feel like I missed the boat on that; but the rationalists I’ve met are super interesting. I have a developed thought about what it means to be a good person, but I’m pretty tempered on all of this. I feel like that’s the benefit of getting older.\nI end up with friends across a very wide age bracket (my oldest friends are in their early 50s and my youngest friends are early 20s).\n(Oh, I’m straight as well)\nFeel free to reach out at nchutcheson@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿Updated: 9/27/25 \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind me on Instagram for additional photos, or to communicate -  https://www.instagram.com/phxtj or email me tjguitar85 at gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nHi there! \r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is TJ and I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. I have a bachelor of arts in performing arts music, but I have never been compensated for anything remotely artistic in my entire life.  I have worked in the federal government for the last five years. In those five years, I’ve been an airport security screener, a tax auditor and a project manager.  I currently live in South Orange County, California - I have previously lived in Arizona, Hawaii and various other parts of Southern California. I am absolutely willing to relocate for the right person.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am 40 and I would consider an acceptable dating range to be someone in her early 30s to very early 50's. I would only consider monogamy, and my deal breakers are smoked substances, recreational drug usage, and general meanness. I have never had a girlfriend though I’ve lost track of the people I have met on OLD - I have been on OLD - off and on - since before swipe apps were a thing. I’m hoping this longer form word doc does a better job of actually marketing myself to someone who finds my flavor of weird adorable.\r\nI drink so little alcohol that my swipe apps have been toggled to “no” (and I’d be completely fine never drinking again if that’s your lifestyle preference), though the last few times I’ve been to Maui I did have my fair share of mai tais on the booze cruise.\r\n\r\n\r\nI go back and forth between wanting to chuck my career to pursue global nomadic life (with a partner) or just find a kind and interesting person to settle in one spot with. (Because maybe I should just be grateful for all the places I’ve been able to travel to in the past?) In all reality, my life will end up something in between.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy going for scenic walks and being near, on, or in the water. I also like going to concerts. In the past year I saw Eric Clapton, the Goo Goo Dolls twice and multiple orchestral concerts. I also enjoy board games and trivia. \r\n\r\n\r\nI do like to travel, but I don’t like solo travel. For me this has meant travel with family or if I go alone, it’s probably some type of organized group tour.  I’ve been to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, I rented an AirBNB restored trailer in somebody's yard for 28 nights (monthly discount!), explored Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon, and soaked in Iceland's Blue Lagoon (though the skies did not cooperate and I could not see the Aurora Borealis....)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's not to say I don't enjoy life closer to home. Sometimes exploring the world looks like finding a new restaurant and trying something new on the menu. I also enjoy being a spectator or participant in numerous sports.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a partner to share life's moments with, both large and small. My ideal relationship emphasizes quality time, mutual respect, affection, and straightforward communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to prefer one on one and smaller group socializing over large group hangouts, but I can hang in the large ones on occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been planning my own life for the past 20ish years. I'm more than ready to share the burden with someone else who wants to take it on. Even better if you’re the planner type because I tend to be pretty go with the flow - though clearly I’ve planned everything for myself for a long time, so I am capable and willing to do some planning.   :) \r\n\r\n\r\nI do try to make some “healthier” choices but I am definitely not on a strict healthy diet. For example, I eat salmon twice a week, but only with teriyaki sauce to cover up the native salmon taste. I often will substitute ham or turkey bacon when in the past I would have chosen bacon or sausage without hesitation. I haven’t eliminated those meats but it’s less often. I also tend to get ham instead of pepperoni on pizza.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not have any kids, and I’ve never had a burning desire to be a parent. For that reason, I don’t think that I would be compatible with someone who definitely wants kids. I look forward to a future where I can take advantage of last minute travel deals and don’t need to schedule my life around a structured work schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not consider myself religious, but I was raised religiously Lutheran and I do in fact have some Ashkenazi Jewish in me according to a spit test of my DNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always identified as more of a political moderate, but as a federal employee, January 2025 absolutely sent me more towards the left.\r\n \r\nI’ve been part of the FIRE community for a while, and I naturally lean frugal - but I’m not rigid about that and I’m willing to compromise to some extent to avoid a perpetual single life. :D I can’t imagine ever needing to receive financial support from a romantic partner - and I’m definitely not looking for a “traditional gender roles” scenario - I very much would like to give and receive an abundance of emotional support and physical affection. To throw out some numbers for context, my life basically costs $5k per month if you assume a $2k per month housing cost. I could definitely spend more if there was more travel involved (but I’m all about credit card points and miles to reduce the cost of that…).\r\n\r\n\r\nI prefer warm temperatures and I can be sensitive to the cold. One time I went to Flagstaff for a  snowboarding trip with some friends and I was shivering under the covers in a hoodie as my friends did not want to turn the heater on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, my temperature preferences seem to be the opposite of a lot of the people who I meet. I do try to stay active. I love going for walks by the ocean - the last time I went to Maui, I walked 7 miles every day on the boardwalks.I have never lived somewhere with actual winter. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I'm looking for someone who really does actively want a romantic and life partner like I do - not one of those who has the mindset of “if it happens, it happens”. I hope it’s you, because I’m pushing 40 and it would be great to meet you sooner rather than later."

I work as a software engineer at Robinhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality: \r\n* Friends say I’m: easygoing, calm, thoughtful, their best friend\r\n* Love fun thoughtful conversations- about politics/policy, science, life/vulnerability, books, whether dating docs are useful or weird\r\n* Usually there’s something I’m very excited about. Often it’s some cooking project or a book/show I’m evangelizing. Right now (may 2024) houseplants and fermented foods, before that it was marathon training\r\n* Medium introverted\r\n* Strive for kindness, honesty, open/direct communication, integrity / efforts to live my values\r\n* Vegan, for animal ethics reasons. note!! partner does not need to be vegan\r\n* Less career-ambitious and more frugal (than most people i hang out with)\r\n* Sleep early and wake up early (usually). I have a morning routine that I like to stick to.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterests:\r\n* Mindfulness meditation is a big part of my life.

Get in touch with me or share with men who you think might be a good match.\r\nI work in a big consulting firm (for skill building and “earning to give”) but previously dabbled in pandemic preparedness policy, research, nonprofit work, and a biotech startup. Located in Berlin as of August 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is the most recent picture (July 2025). I need to update my photos however, I have since cut my hair to shoulder length\r\n🍦Pro\r\n* Energetic and bubbly. I laugh a lot, and I’m an easy audience if you want to test your own comedic aptitude. Examples of this:\r\n   * Exercise and humour are my favourite coping skills, so…—well, I better be strong and hilarious.\r\n   * I play improv and host improv workshops sometimes.\r\n   * I go hoarse before I run out of social energy.\r\n* Deliberate approach to life, love efficiency, agentic as fuck.\r\n   * Nothing that can’t be solved with a spreadsheet, a rubber duck, and coffee.\r\n   * I found my last longterm partner after less than 2 months of building a funnel with screening criteria and setting up 5-min video calls. I won’t be a great match for most, and want to be mindful of everyone’s time while I find the person who is. \r\n* Excitable & curious. \r\n   * I’ve been told that my questions are unique and inspiring.\r\n   * I can make surface-level boring topics like patent landscaping and ISO standards sexy.\r\n* Committed to self-improvement.\r\n   * I had a lot of coaching and have set up systems so I don’t make the same mistake twice. I like having essentialist routines and hacking my brain.\r\n   * I worked as a junior psychiatrist before. I am trained in CBT and NVC, and not afraid to use both to help us grow.\r\n* Emotionally stable & pragmatic.\r\n   * Friends appreciate how I balance succinctness and solution-focus with warmth and care.\r\n   * For years, I lived out of a suitcase and didn’t really have a home address. I also cached in dozens of rejections before finding my academic supervisor—but I’m really happy most of the time. This is to say, I’m rather tolerant of uncertainty and rejection in both my personal and professional life.\r\n⚖️ Neutral (?)\r\n* Vegetarian.\r\n   * It’s important to me that my partner is vegetarian or vegan, too.\r\n* I don’t do alcohol, cigarettes, or THC.\r\n   * I care about sharing an evidence-based, healthy lifestyle that acknowledges tradeoffs quantitatively.\r\n   * Not all drugs are created equal; I’ve found psychonauting with loved ones meaningful and connecting. \r\n* No children, by default.\r\n   * Unlikely circumstances such as ²⁴⁄₇ nanny support, a surrogate, and strong impact-related arguments could change my mind if my partner became very excited about having children.\r\n* Good dancer.\r\n   * As a pretty low priority, I would love to find someone who’s into dancing, too. But I’m too impatient to take beginner’s classes together. \r\n🦄 Con/”Niche taste”\r\n* I work a lot. \r\n   * I usually travel for work 4 days a week, and quite long hours. We’ll probably need to compromise and get creative to make space for enough quality time.\r\n* Disagreeable and very direct.\r\n   * I’m also responsive to feedback on my communication style. Still, I’m a better match for someone who enjoys mutual teasing and the occasional roast.\r\n   * I love people who sharpen my thinking—let’s be each other’s whetstones, like these two.\r\n* My sleep is sacred.\r\n   * I need to leave dates before 22:30, otherwise I turn into a pumpkin. Sometimes, I need to set timers for physical intimacy.\r\n🧩 And you?\r\nI’d like to find a partner who has been told he’s a great communicator and fundamentally cares about similar things as I do. Of course, I like all the things most people find attractive in potential mates (humour, intelligence, kindness, success, conventional physical attractiveness, etc). However, I don’t believe I—or anyone, really—can armchair checkbox-criteria for compatibility. You should err on the side of getting in touch! I won’t bite I only bite with consent!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve read until here and think we vibe, tell me why we would make a great team, and I’ll make time to chat: nadia@montazeri.co or via Facebook messenger (Nadia Xenia Montazeri). Please also share some photos or links to socials. 😊\r\n⭐ Testimonial\r\nI’m good friends with Jan, my previous partner, and I asked him for a review I could add to this document. Here’s what he wrote:\r\n“Nadia and I were in a relationship for two years, so as a Nadia connoisseur, I want to share my experience with you. Reading this document, you might feel like I felt eons ago, when I first encountered her. A bit intimidated, a bit confused, but also intrigued and excited. Being with Nadia is an acquired, yet highly rewarding taste.\r\nYou know how when you go lift weights, you should have a spotter? Someone that both has your back, but also pushes you to improve?\r\nNadia is like that, but for life. Being with her is like standing on a skyscraper-grade foundation and simultaneously jumping on a trampoline. \r\nYou're having a good day? You will not find a more bubbly, more enthusiastic, more supportive person to share it with. Nadia is thirsty for life, and she will show you how to drink your day with gusto. Her shenanigans are legendary and her laughter is more contagious than a pandemic.\r\nYou're having a bad day? She will hold you and show you that it's okay to be vulnerable, that it's okay to be human. With her, heaven is just a hug away. Nadia deeply cares about those around her, and she will always be there for you. She is a person both sharp and soft, both strong and gentle, both wise and curious. Nadia has a vast, vast soul, a one-of-a-kind soul that you will always remember.”\r\n🎨 Pictures\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Pyjama party! I’m the one with the pink toothbrush)\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(yes, I’m tiny, 1.57m)"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi, I'm Ori!\r\nI'm looking for a playful companion to go on shared missions, the piece of myself I don’t know that I am missing... If you resonate with what you read, you can just send me your profile, a small description of yourself and/or answer one of the icebreaker questions I put for you at the bottom. My email: ashesphoenix235@gmail.com\r\nIf you know someone who you think fits, feel free to send them the link to this doc.\r\nAll photos from 2023\r\n    \r\n                                                                                                                         The one with the white shirt is me.\r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\nbased on recent endorsements: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t[Placeholder for sophisticated show-don't-tell pieces of text that display that some of those adjectives apply to me.]\r\nOther long-term customer reviews: \"She is a rare dialectical mix of very rational and very emotional.\"\r\n“Looks like Tinkerbell”\r\n\tWhat tests say about me: \r\n* BIG 5: Very high “Openness to Experience” and “Agreeableness”, average “Emotional Stability”, “Extraversion”, and “Conscientiousness”.\r\n* Outlier scores: Mensa member, hyper-phantasia (vivid mental experiencing), Highly Sensitive Person (HSP: feeling intensely).\r\n* Hogwarts hat announced: 37% Ravenclaw, 29% Gryffindor, 19% Hufflepuff, 15% Slytherin.\r\nWhat I say about myself:\r\n* Ordinary romantic carbon-based cell-cluster looking for their person\r\n* I am into science, entrepreneurship, psychology, health, AI, Sci-Fi, love, and making music. \r\n* I have a personality, hobbies, and questions, like lists and statements with percentages.\r\n\r\nSome hard facts\r\nBody: tiny, athletic (exercises almost every day), in her thirties, overestimated 38% muscle mass (the rest is mainly cucumber), vegan, and low-carb when convenient.\r\nOrientation: Hetero, monogamous, on the demi- and sapiosexual spectrum, switch, unlikely to want kids (20%, in case my future partner can inspire me with his vision of a family and the shared mission around it).\r\nLocation: Currently living in Berlin, but want to move somewhere else. Looking for one or more places to make and call home. Often traveling to explore different cities.\r\nSome soft facts\r\nGood conversationalist. People who have just met me frequently state that they enjoyed conversing with me to an unusual extent, that they feel seen and inspired. Also, partners and friends often acknowledge my constructive and compassionate way I deal with and communicate during conflicts, even in heated situations or when I feel hurt.\r\nFemale MacGyver: I can heat the flat by opening the oven, prepare eggs in a water cooker, find and use the holes in systems. My time on this planet has shown again and again that problem-solving to bring something useful and new to life seems to be my superpower.\r\n\r\nWhat I do\r\nMy calling. The work I do isn't just a career—it's an extension of my deepest hope for humanity. Each small victory in creating positive change fills me with a sense of purpose that resonates through everything else in my life. Operating at the intersection of science, mental health, and kindergarten-ing (leadership ;), I founded, built, and manage a Non-Profit Organization. Based on the principles of Effective Altruism, we aim to do good better and to prove if we actually do that. Soon, I'll attempt to build something new. One thing I am proud of is that I have been the youngest professor ever appointed at the university where I used to work.\r\nMaking music. I play the keyboard and the organic instrument (voice ^.^), very gladly and very mediocre. Single-player and multiplayer modes are available. Genres: mainly jazz, rock, and soul. Covers, improvising, or songwriting. My favorite quote from myself: \"Nothing is so bad that you can't write a good song about it.\" I might get excited to show you songs I contributed to or wrote at trust level 3.\r\nLearning. Learning new things lights a fire in me that's hard to describe—it's that rush of connecting dots, of seeing the world through a new lens, of feeling my mind expanding.There is a long list of topics I'd like to dive into. Recent topics I've learned more about: ETFs, spine-related and supplement science (medical stuff), and how to build and prompt LLM agents. Also, I am still on the journey to finding a type of dance to do regularly again. The latest ones tested: contact improvisation, Bachata and Swing dance (beginner+), before that, pole dance, and Aerial hoop (not so much a beginner).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy social life\r\nCommunities: I love mingling at national and international weekends/events organized by communities such as Dynamite Circle, Effective Altruism, LessWrong, Mensa, Burning Man.\r\nSharing. Understanding how the world works and what it looks like for other people, especially those close to me and those I admire, has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was a teenager. Many thoughts during my day are dedicated to this. I love listening to people sharing their latest insights, ideas, or solutions they came up with, e.g., their new start-up pitch, or results from their daily observations or experiments with reality.\r\nClose ones. The friendships I treasure most are the \"Frodo & Sam\" type, where silence feels as comfortable as conversation, where the connection remains unshaken even through life's storms, and where you know you could call at 4 am, and they'd be there for you as you'd be for them. I feel lucky and thankful to have a few of those humans in my life.\r\nWhat I am looking for\r\nTL;DR: A vulnerable Chuck Norris with empathy ;-). A loving and deep companionship.\r\nI'm seeking someone whose presence feels like coming home after a long journey— safe, and exactly where I'm meant to be. Someone whose mind challenges mine and who knows the melody of my heart by heart.\r\n   * Male and single, 26–43 years old\r\n   * Caring, cognitively and emotionally empathetic\r\n   * Altruistically ambitious: works or would like to work on projects that make the world better. No astrology or healing stones stuff :-)\r\n   * Intellectually excitable: enjoys learning, exploring with their mind, and growing together\r\n   * Emotionally in tune and mature, secure attachment style, high reliability\r\n   * Overall healthy lifestyle: does not need to be a vegan yogi, just someone who takes care of themselves and their future self to age in a healthy way\r\n   * Playful and humorous\r\nPlus points:\r\n   * Would be okay to live in one or multiple moderately-sized cities (300k-1M) close to larger bodies of water, and somewhere not too cold in the winter\r\n   * Has a creative outlet one can engage in together, e.g., plays at least one instrument well, and maybe would like to jam together\r\n   * Might be interested in working on projects, initiatives, or organizations together one day\r\nIn case you’re uncertain how to approach me, here are some icebreaker questions you could answer:\r\n   * What is your current mission, and what would you rise from the ashes for?\r\n   * What was a bold decision that you made recently?\r\n   * What is one thing you changed your mind about recently, and the reason why you did?\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo, no, pinky promise, this is really me! ;-)"

I'm Harry Altman, aka Sniffnoy.  You might have encountered me on the\ninternet before.  I do math, and in particular I can talk your ear off about\nthe problem of writing numbers with ones, addition, and multiplication!  And\nlots of variants of the problem.  I won't do that here though, I'll save\nthat for later.  :D\nAlso I like infinities.  I've also been working a bunch on doing silly\nthings with infinities.  This is actually much easier, but unfortunately\nit's way harder to explain to people!  Again, best saved for another time.\n:)  Also various other math things, like some neat Fibonacci things\nrecently, but, uh, this isn't supposed to be a research statement, so I'll\nmove on to a different topic. :P\nI don't actually have an academic position anywhere, so this past 5 years\nI've worked a programming job to support my math habit. :)  I was writing an\nEthereum smart contract debugger, if you're interested; but that's come to a\nclose now so now I have a lot more time to get other things done again!\nOK so the thing is... like, I guess this is a place to describe oneself,\nbut I'm kind of averse to doing that?  I guess a big thing there is that I\nworry about verbal overshadowing and also creating fixity, that by\ndescribing myself I will thereby cause myself to identify with those\ndescriptions, which is something I want to avoid.\nSo, well, I guess I will try to say only things that are quite definitely\ntrue, or to show rather than telling!\nI guess, I like things that are a bit off from what people expect.\nSometimes, as in my mathematical work, these things are quite natural -- but\nnature doesn't always meet your expectations!  Or (to take a page from\nYudkowsky's book), I should say that people's expectations don't always meet\nnature. 😁  Sometimes nice questions have nasty answers, and I like to\ndisgust people with them. :D  And sometimes nasty-seeming constructions have\nnice results, and I like to amaze people with them!\nBut I'm interested in the artificial as well as the natural; a thing I\nfind really fascinating is, like, bizarrely complicated conventions and\nunderstanding where they come from and all the weird cases they generate.\nThings like text encoding (particularly Unicode) and data encoding in\ncomputers; unusual calendars (it's fun to explain the Hebrew calendar to\npeople 😁); and other such things.  I am trying to more often say \"huh,\nthat's a strange word, I wonder where it comes from?\" and look up its\netymology.  So many things that appear to not make sense, the reason is, it\nused to make sense, but then it wasn't updated when circumstances changed!\nAnd I really like learning about the history of how that occurred.\nI also like taking pictures of the local wildlife, which mostly means\nbugs and birds. :)  Here in New York mostly birds, I don't see a lot of good\nbugs here.  Although there are rats! :D  Of course, rats don't like light or\npeople, which makes photographing them tricky, but it can be done!  Back in\nAnn Arbor I'd see a lot more good bugs.\nUh, what are other good stories for illustrating myself?  Um, here's one\nthat comes to mind.  Once, I was visiting my friends Colin and Aviva out in\nChicago, and we were in the car, along with their dog, Gately.  (Gately has\nsince died, unfortunately.)  I was in the back seat, and Gately was in the\ncenter of the car.  And I thought, you know, dogs are always sniffing each\nother's butts. Gately's butt is right there; I could totally sniff it.  So\nuh I tried sniffing Gately's butt.  It stunk!  Not that much though.  I\ndon't think I really learned anything from doing this. :P\n(Perhaps my favorite thing that anyone has ever said about me: \"Harry,\nyou are very good at making arguments, but you are not good at not doing\nannoying things with the cat toy.\" 😁)\nMe elsewhere on the web\nMy homepage\nThis is where you can find my papers and other neat little\nthings.\nMy Dreamwidth\nblog\nMostly just a silly personal blog, I also write about math here\nand sometimes other thoughts.\nMy Facebook\nprofile\nThis is where I post all my pictures! Um, although if you don't\nat least know someone in common with me, I guess you mostly\nwon't be able to see them.  Sorry.  I should really start using\na proper photo-sharing website... (at the least you can see some\nmore pictures of me!)\nA talk on\ninfinities I once did\nI realize most people reading this will find this completely\nincomprehensible, but hey, maybe you want to hear my voice. :)\nContact info\nI can be reached via email at\n.\nMostly-standard dating profile info that you already saw most of on the\ndirectory\n(But I look younger :) )\nLocation: New York City\nLocation flexibility: I don't really like to travel a lot but maybe\nif you're within reach of one of the non-Amtrak trains?\nInterested in: Women\nMonogamous or polyamorous?: Definite preference for the latter;\nformer's not entirely out of the question but it would need some\ndiscussion at least.\nWhat am I looking for overall?: Um I don't know I'd like to just see\nwhere things go?\nDo I want to have kids?: I definitely kind of do but am a little\nunsure how to make that work with everything else I'm doing! 😅  So\nmaybe that doesn't end up happening, I don't know..."

      "fullText": "Here's looking at me – Telegraph\nHere's looking at me\nLuca\nMay 17, 2024\nHere's looking at me\nLuca\nI am a run-of-the-mill carbon-based life form, living on the planet currently known as Earth (or so I've been told). If you're reading this, it's highly likely you've come across my profile on Hinge. This must be the fourth or fifth time I've created an account there. It's not that I haven't had any luck -- I've connected with some interesting people, but obviously nothing that has worked out well enough to stop me wanting to go back.\nI thought I'd write a profile (a \"\ndate-me doc\n\" of sorts) for those piqued enough by the very limited window provided by Hinge to want to get to know me more, but on second thoughts I thought I'd do something different. So here's a list of reasons NOT to date me:\nI'm married. No two ways about it: some time in 2005, I entered into a civil marriage, which is still valid on paper. The marriage didn't work out, and my wife and I have lived separately since 2018. Neither of us see the point in getting a divorce as of now, but this will obviously change if there's a good enough reason for it. Needless to say, neither of us has problems with the other seeking other romantic interests.\nSteinbeck once referred to poor Americans seeing themselves as \"temporarily embarrassed millionaires\". Well in my case the pandemic and its aftermath has found me in a similar circumstance of temporary embarrassment (which I hope is truly temporary). I work with languages and have freelanced all my working life -- something that worked just fine, despite the unavoidable ups and downs, until a few years ago. Every now and then, it does begin to look like things might pick up again, but only time will tell if they really do. So all you prospective sugar babies can happily walk right past me and I hope you manage to find your pot(belly) of gold. But for those of you who might still be willing to overlook this: I have never been that interested in making money or other indicators of worldly success. Right now, the only interest I still have in doing so is to uphold my commitment to my children (did I mention I have children? Well I do: two of the most wonderful persons I've ever had the pleasure of knowing).\nI can be a bit of a curmudgeon -- it's hard to get me excited about what's happening in the world outside (or even convincing me of its existence on some days), at least not for its own worth. In the right company, however, even the most humdrum, everyday activities take on the aura of the most exciting thing the world has ever known, and more than anything else, this quest of mine is for that right company.\nThat's it for now, but I'm sure there are many more reasons to weigh the prospect of seeing and going out (or staying in) with me very carefully. I promise to add them to the list as and when they occur to me.\nEdit\nPublish\nReport content on this page\nReport Page\nViolence\nChild Abuse\nCopyright\nIllegal Drugs\nPersonal Details\nOther\nPlease submit your DMCA takedown request to\ndmca@telegram.org\nCancel\nReport"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi! I’m Rishi!\r\n34 | male | hetero | monogamous | 5’5” | San Francisco, CA | seeking LTR/marriage/kids\r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nPlant-based 30-something with a big heart seeks woman for urban hikes, carry-on-only travels, friendly but competitive game nights, dance parties, marriage, babies, and everything in between.\r\nPics!\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore pics on Instagram and at the end if you want to see more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho am I?\r\nI’m insatiably curious, embrace silliness and play, and love to find adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to pick up new hobbies/obsessions every few years but the consistent themes are healthy living (cooking, exercise, sauna, meditation, healthspan extension), adventures (travel, hiking, biking, camping), and intellectual curiosity (wikipedia wormholes, reading fiction, history and geopolitics).\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m an extrovert by the traditional definition but I enjoy spending time alone as much as meeting large groups of random strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was raised in Pittsburgh, PA by Indian immigrant parents and have lived in San Francisco for most of the last decade with a stint in London in between. I’m somewhat agnostic to location but have grown accustomed to the Mediterranean climate of the Bay Area. I’m pretty close to my family and they play an important role in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up vegetarian and became vegan 10 years ago because I care about reducing animal cruelty. It’s not a dealbreaker but I’d prefer to be with someone who is plant-based or at least respects the decision I have made. I love to cook for others and people who have tried my cooking have said they could be vegan if they could have food like that all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nSomeone family-oriented who is excited about finding a monogamous long term relationship leading to marriage/kids. I am open to biological children or adopting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone kind and empathetic who cares about helping other people and the world around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is interested in living a healthy and active lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is passionate about something (work/hobbies/ideas). We don’t have to share all of the same interests but we should be excited about supporting each other’s passions and goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is open-minded to a little weirdness but still grounded in reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to live a comfortable but relatively simple lifestyle that values experiences over possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\nE-mail me at rsmohnot@gmail.com or DM me on Instagram or get an intro from someone I know (probably my brother who has like 5M friends).\r\nMore Pics\r\n  \r\n\r\nI organize a monthly walk and hang around a neighborhood in San Francisco for groups of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nFam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI was one of those people who got stuck in the mud at Burning Man in 2023.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI climbed this 100ft tall tree in Vancouver\r\n  \r\n\r\nI officiated my brother's burning man wedding in a dust storm while standing on a Funkadelephant, a giant mechanical elephant art car.\r\n  \r\n        \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEaster egg for reaching the end: My sister in law INSISTED that I put this picture in - I’m helping her move a really heavy console table up the stairs"

      "fullText": "﻿João’s Date-me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! How fun is this? Date-me docs! Is that a great idea, or what? (no, really, I’m actually asking)\r\nAbout me\r\nMy name is João. Don’t worry about how to pronounce it. I’m 5'8\" and 48 years old. I’m Portuguese, but I’ve been living in Cambridge (UK, not MA - sorry Massachutessans!) for over 10 years, where I work as a software engineer. Oh, almost forgot:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the pictures are a few years old, but you can easily recognize the more recent ones by the amount of grey hair. I come complete with the dad-bod and the dad jokes, but no actual children. Trying to be more fit, but it’s been a slow process, and the frequent travels to Portugal where the amazing food is very hard to resist don’t help.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m more often in than out, but let’s talk about out first: I enjoy going to the cinema, meeting friends at the pub, having fancy dinners, going for a nice walk. My geeky side also likes board games, escape rooms, bowling, that sort of thing. I was very keen on standup comedy in the past (and was once a standup comedian myself!) but haven’t been there so much lately. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I’m in, I’m probably watching Netflix shows, or playing video games. If you’re also a gamer, great, let’s play something together; if you’re not, don’t worry, my gaming is always secondary to my dating, or any other social activity for that matter. Back to Netflix, I like mostly sci-fi, anything “mind-bending”, psychological horror, and (true or false) crime dramas, but I have a soft spot for sitcoms and romantic movies. I can also be found listening to podcasts while doing house chores, or doing homework for my Italian classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a firm believer that Everybody Likes Travelling™ (admittedly some more than others), so that’s really a non-question. My relationship with travelling is a weird one: I’m not a travel-obsessed person but actually end up travelling a lot. I’ve been to 4 continents (treating North and South America as 2) and 10+ European countries, but never to Paris. Or Ely, for that matter. I’ve travelled alone before, but it’s not the same without the right company.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live comfortably, have my own flat, live a peaceful and quiet life. I’m independent, quite used to being on my own, simply looking for someone to go out with, talk to, share and care (and touch and kiss).\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nMy phone. Almost every time. The keys are usually always at the same place but the phone could be anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously though. I’m looking for a straight, monogamous, long-term relationship. I’m not too picky, but be aware that I’m probably writing a whole page detailing who I want you to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, regardless of what you read below, if you’re looking for friendship or just someone to talk to, go ahead and send me a message! I’m friendly and a good listener, as long as you’re not harassing me or asking me for money on the Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers: smokers and drug users (which is the minimum, really), covered in tattoos or piercings (one or two are fine).\r\n\r\n\r\nNo limits on age, height, race, but be aware that I’m 48 and 5'8\". Some women like them tall and some women like them young and I’m neither of those.\r\n\r\n\r\nProximity is important. If you live around Cambridge that’s ideal; London and Essex are ok too. If you live further away, I think we better stay as friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are one or more of these things, that’s fine, but be aware that I’m not: vegetarian or vegan, religious or spiritual, right-wing, sports fan. I’m very tolerant and accepting of other people’s beliefs, convictions and lifestyles (and I like the occasional vegan meal), but I’m not looking to change my own on these matters (ok, you might be able to convince me to get into sports).\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren are welcome: I like them and in general they tend to like me too. I don’t have any and it’s too late for me to get my own now. Grandchildren is where I draw the line - I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. If you don’t have children, that’s fine too, it means we have more time for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPets. I know some of you are very passionate about your furry friends. I like both dogs and cats but have none of them. The closest thing to a pet are Tom and Ada which are my tomato plants and are still surviving despite my inexperience with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for one person only. If only one of you replies to this and turns out to be the right one, that’s enough for me. But of course that’s in an ideal world, and in the pursuit of a long-term relationship sometimes we have to stumble in a few short-term ones. Also, I have a bit of trouble juggling different relationships even before the point of official exclusivity, so apologies if you get put on hold (I know, that’s a terrible thing to say, and I’m sorry) while I’m dating someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, physical attractiveness, chemistry, sparks, these kinds of stuff are highly subjective but important (as I’ve learned over the years). While in principle I don’t discriminate between age, size, race, etc., if I don’t feel physically attracted to you, or if I somehow feel that the chemistry is not there, then it’s not going to work. That goes for you too, obviously.\r\nIf you’re interested\r\nAn email would be great, to djeidot@gmail.com. As you can probably tell, I like people who write a lot. Search for djeidot on Instagram if you prefer to start with just a Hi and go from there."

      "fullText": "﻿Text me maybe? \r\nI read about Date Me Doc recently, and I was excited to get started. I try to make it as digestible as possible, if anything is not clear just ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n*       \r\n\r\nMy Story \r\n   * Age - Mid 30s\r\n   * Height - 5ft 7\r\n   * Sexual orientation - Straight, strictly monogamous \r\n   * Location: London, UK\r\n   * Languages - English, Mandarin, Korean, Malay, (want to learn Spanish)\r\n   * Human Design Type: Manifestor\r\n   * Attachment style : Fairly secure, tendency to be anxious\r\n   * Love languages: Beyond touch, act of service and words of affirmations; I seek stability, commitment and conscious communication\r\n   * What I can offer: Patience. Listening. Awareness. Conscious communication. Friendship. Independence. Space. Teamwork. Compassion. Reassurance. Personal and relationship growth. Shared memes. Comfortable Silence. Delicious food. Emotional and Physical Intimacy \r\n   * Life quest: learning how to swim, free-diving, own a 5-bed home, have family, and own a book cafe that encourages people to disconnect from their online world. \r\nMalaysian-born mixed-race life enthusiast, who finds joy in little moments and is passionate about personal and professional development. Single-handedly raised by my mother, I learned the values of resilience, determination and gratitude from an early age. Despite its challenges, my childhood was filled with beautiful memories, love, laughter and experiences. My academic journey took me to South Korea, and ultimately to UK, where I now call home. \r\nFamily holds a special place in my heart. I live with my mom since my last relationship, and remain in close contact with my brother, who’s married. I have a close knit circle of friends and community, who I consider extended family – these connections ground me and remind the importance of love and support. \r\nImportant to know - I don’t drink alcohol,but I have an active social life. I enjoy socializing in ways that foster deep conversations via conversation cards and shared experience. I enjoy hosting, inviting friends over for dinner or social events. In addition to that, I seek spiritual experiences such as cacao ceremonies, breathwork sessions, and forest bathing. These activities allow me to connect with my inner world, God, nature and explore different dimensions of consciousness, and deepen my appreciation for the world around me. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love books - self growth, historical, geographical and autobiographies. I love random adventures, peace and quiet. I love everything about nature, indoor, outdoor spaces, fresh air. I love warm nights sleeping with the windows open.I am the type of person who gets excited about sunrises and sunsets, the night sky, thunder and the scent after the rain and engages in deep conversation while holding a mug filled with hot chocolates, sitting by the fire. I love not wasting. I love freshly squeezed orange juices. I love and I love and I hope I always keep on loving and choose love. \r\nI find joy in movements, of any sort - lately, I have been redefining my own limits and engaging a lot with salsa-bachata dancing, F45 exercises, Hyrox and the Turf Games competition. I also love reading, watching documentaries, and listening to podcasts - constantly expanding my knowledge and understanding of how this world works. \r\nWhat I am seeking:\r\nI want to connect, and genuinely get to know that person at a deeper level before we decide to embark on a journey called relationship. In my case, I am looking for my life partner. \r\nMy ideal partner is someone who shares similar values, which are non-negotiables —fitness, family and growth mindset. Ideally, someone who appreciates physical, emotional and spiritual intimacy, physically active, adventurous, trustworthy, has the ability to be vulnerable, and appreciates PDA.Ideally my partner would:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Prioritize family -I value maintaining strong ties with yours, my family and/or building family of our own. \r\n   * Want children - I want to have only one child and to conceive naturally. I love my life, enjoy travelling and I want to continue doing the things that bring me joy, finding my purpose in life and contributing to this world. I want to share these experiences with you and our children. Therefore, one is enough. I believe in natural order, and will not endure the pains and lengths of IVF or egg/embryo freezing to have children. \r\n   * Be physically active - Share my passion for physical activities and maintain healthy lifestyle. Love outdoor adventures.\r\n   * Growth and abundance mindset - embrace positive outlook of life, focusing on growth, gratitude and the belief that there is enough for everyone and there’s solutions to every problem. \r\n   * Vulnerability and communication: I believe that having the ability to be vulnerable allows deeper intimacy. Conscious, open, honest communication is important to me. \r\n   * Kind - Display kindness not just towards me, but to everyone around you, me, us, including animals. \r\n   * Shared household responsibilities – be willing to contribute equally to household tasks and chores, as well as taking the initiatives to keep our relationship alive through planning dates and quality time together.\r\n   * Spirituality - Have a strong faith or spiritual practice, willing to do the deep work. Spirituality is an important part of my life and I would like to share /exchange that with my partner. \r\n\r\n\r\nDate Bucket List\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Parkrun 9am Saturday & brunch\r\n   2. Farmer’s market \r\n   3. Arcade fun \r\nQ&A with Bilqis\r\nConscious relationship agreement - core values (something I’d like to have when we get into relationship)\r\n   1. No secrets - imagine our connections to each other like a living energy between us. I’ve noticed that with most relationships the natural tendency is for this filmy layer to build up between us, small unspoken things or untruths only add to that layer and it becomes hard to truly see and feel close with each other. Radical honesty is a way of wiping away that layer between us. It keeps the connection clear. This doesn’t mean we don’t respect each other’s privacy. \r\n   2. We are a team. As a team we get to play to our strengths. The ways we show up in our relationship are unique and there isn’t an expectation that because I do X, you will do X. It’s more about how can we both most authentically contribute and does that dynamic leave us both feeling nourished and supported. \r\n   3. No one outside the partnership knows more than we do. There isn’t a single (consequential ) thing someone else could tell me that I don’t already know. In moments of tension, instead of my first reaction being venting to friends, this practice has encouraged me to go inward first, to journal or speak to my partner to work through it. \r\n   4. No request or feeling is inherently “wrong” and everything can be talked about. Let’s create a space that felt like freedom, not judgement.

By pumping your weight on it, you could make the whole thing bounce and spring like an enormous diving board.  Then, you'd feel like you were surfing in midair.  Great fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn a visit to Big Sur to see my dear friend Gary.  He and I go back to middle school.  His birth certificate says “Dorian”.  One day, it was revealed to me by divine inspiration that Dorian's name is actually Gary Holcombe.  He felt confused at first, but he took to it pretty quickly.  Then, before long, he decided that my name is also actually Gary Holcombe.  We've been Gary and Gary ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat percentage of my life do I spend consuming text?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nProof that my Kinsey score is actually 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAm I exploiting the bridge study by showing you a pretty sunset?  Maybe.  Maybe I am.\r\nNonfiction is magic\r\nThe first thing you should know about me is that I read SO. many. books.\r\nDo you read?  Eighty points of extra credit if you guzzle nonfiction too.  I want to hear from my fellow bookworms!  You can win my heart by talking to me about books.\r\nHere's an old list of books I considered life-changing when I read them.\r\nHere's a newer list of all the books I've finished in the last two years.  (The two lists don't overlap.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite subjects is “applied psychology”—relationships, EQ, communication, motivation, parenting, and happiness.  I consider that genre one of the best tools for leveling up as a person.  What would the world look like if more people invested time in this?\r\n(Someone who knows me well looked at this part and said: “Your special interest is relationships.”  Take that as you will.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my other favorite subjects are: business, sociology, economics, neuroscience, cooking, sexuality, cultural history, memoirs, and many more.  The secret manual for life is sitting right here in plain sight!  And it's free!  Libraries are a point discontinuity in capitalism—a 100% taxpayer-subsidized public good!  It's true what they say: teachers (including authors) can open a door, but it's up to each individual to walk through that door.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, my ideal partner is a curious lifelong learner who finds joy and meaning in continuous personal growth.  I dream of bringing out the best in each other for decades and decades.\r\nHelp me stay on track to master cooking?  Write poems?  Play instruments?  Compose music?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I help you stay inspired to do?  I want to be a person's rock while they grow toward their dreams.  I want to surprise my future spouse with little gifts to support their projects and interests.  If part of that looks like evangelizing books to each other, I'll be thrilled.  😉\r\nWhat I'm like as a partner\r\n  \r\n\r\nEver since I saw this, I've been saying “geef” and “beef” in my head.\r\nSadly, the non-binary case has an awkward near-homophone.\r\nCould we say they're a “theef” of hearts?\r\n\r\n\r\n* Super duper affectionate\r\n   * Near-constant stream of verbal and physical strokes\r\n   * Figuratively-never not touching you\r\n   * Will use pet names more than your legal name\r\n* Rotates through all five love languages\r\n* Generous with shoulder rubs\r\n* Practices and expects non-violent communication\r\n   * This is a hard requirement\r\n   * Git gud\r\n* Wants to play games\r\n   * As in Dominion with a capital “D”, not a lowercase “d”\r\n   * Please try as hard as you can to beat me\r\n   * Please actually be able to beat me (or be willing to learn / find fulfillment in sharpening your game)\r\n   * Sparring passionately in mind-sports is a profound form of intimacy & a peak human experience\r\n      * Goodness gracious, I want an energetic rival/lover who gives me a run for my money\r\n      * Remember that part in Atlas Shrugged where the young Dagny and Francisco are playing tennis?\r\n         * DISCLAIMER: I placed as a finalist (top 1% worldwide) in the Ayn Rand Institute's Atlas Shrugged essay contest, and will happily talk to you about why Rand is crucially mistaken about the basic mechanics of human psychology but nonetheless raises some interesting points that are otherwise unheard in politics and must be redeemed by nuanced thought and application that Rand herself would likely reject unless she's cooled her jets a bit in the afterlife\r\n         * If you found the above disclaimer unnecessary because you celebrate intellectual curiosity, critical inquiry, and literary cosmopolitanism, please message me already!\r\n   * I can still love my partner even if we don't spar in games, but it would be really great if we did\r\n* Wants to feed you…and be fed by you\r\n* Excellent at playing unofficial therapist\r\n   * Yay, reflective listening and emotional literacy\r\n   * Have been told I’m about as effective as a well-liked real therapist\r\n   * Would also support your seeing a real therapist\r\n* Wants to build you up and emotionally co-regulate you and see you thrive\r\n   * Your joy is my joy\r\n   * Let's achieve some power-couple dreams together!\r\n      * Build a dream house?  Start a business?  Raise a loving family?  Organize a conference?  Found an eco-village?  Go on a food tour of our ancestral homelands?  (Mine's Italy—just saying.)  Compose a duet?  Revel naked under the full moon?\r\n* Clothing optional when it's just us at home\r\n   * The constant warm glow of intimacy from casual nudity with a partner is just…yes\r\n\r\n\r\nA partner who racked up eight years with me offered these suggestions to flesh out the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Wonderful conversations.  Oh, my God.  So much depth.”\r\n* “Endless memeing and inside jokes.”\r\n* “Speaking our own language we've formulated over the years.”\r\n* “Stealing your tea.”\r\n* “Going to Rationalist meetups and philosophy meetups.  And going dancing.”\r\n   * I'm rather new to social dance, but I want to up my game\r\n* “Walks in nature.”\r\n* “Looking at sunsets.”\r\n* “Staying physically active.”\r\n   * Running, hiking, four-square\r\n   * Organizing regular four-square games with a friend group!\r\n   * UPDATE: Weight training and pickleball!  I guess SF got into me.\r\n* “Going to li-ber-ries.”\r\n   * [sic]\r\n   * emphasis on the second syllable\r\n* “Being upset about temperature dysregulation.”\r\n   * I run cold\r\n   * Warmth is love\r\n   * Please ensconce me in warmth\r\n* “Being distressed at noise.”\r\n   * I never go anywhere without three different kinds of earplug in my left pocket\r\n   * Where are my twice-exceptional babes at?\r\n* “Wanting to eat, but not wanting to go out to buy food.”\r\n* “I'm just saying bullshit.”\r\n* “Being cute.”\r\n* “Studying and working passionately.”\r\n* “Talking to people.”\r\n   * “You're very social and outgoing, you know?”\r\n\r\n\r\nShe's great.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOops, I meant: “Rotates through all six love languages”.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCorrect, but they forgot memes.\r\nBasic info\r\n* Age: 31 (est. 1993)\r\n* Sex: male\r\n* Kinsey score: 2\r\n* Height: 6'1\" (and a quarter)\r\n* Pronouns: they/them\r\n* Gender: “Objection!”\r\n   * (say it in a Phoenix Wright voice)\r\n* Born and raised in: Bay Area\r\n* Currently in: Bay Area (formerly Seattle)\r\n* Occupation: startup founder and software engineer\r\n* Future location: wherever “my people” are—and especially where “my person” is\r\n   * So, maybe Berkeley for the ACX readers, or SF for the entrepreneurs?  Or some other city?  I don't know yet, and I want to find out.  I have yet to discover a subculture that shares all, or even most, of my core values.  ACX readers come the closest, but on average, they're missing relational warmth and vibrant affect.  Did I mention I'm a shameless glutton for cuddling and feelings?\r\n      * Update: I’ve found an interesting match (somewhat, ish) with TPOT culture, and I’m trying out the Hayes Valley neighborhood in SF!\r\n      * Update: TPOT culture lacks an intact contract of mutual care, and Hayes Valley ain’t it.  Next on my list: the Outer Sunset neighborhood in SF.  Perhaps, someday, I’ll check out…New York??\r\n   * Like most of my peers, I want to escape cars and atomization.\r\n* Kids: leaning yes/maybe; it depends\r\n   * I have dual concerns about this.\r\n   * I believe humanely navigating the child-rearing years requires some combination of family/community support and financially planning for hired help.\r\n   * I want to nurture others and support their development, without entirely forfeiting my own access to nurturance and development.  This is a major beef I have with the nuclear family model as we currently know it—the two adults are isolated, overextended, and under-supported.  How might we solve this as a family?\r\n* Monogamy/polyamory: let's talk\r\n   * I’m looking for a stable home life, life-mate bond, and economic partnership, founded on an expectation of continuity and permanence, that hopefully doesn’t ban me from enjoying physical affection and intimacy in my friendships.\r\n   * That means I would prefer a “monogamish” variant of ENM with the ideal reader of this doc (hey there, gorgeous!)…\r\n   * …but I would consider going monog if said partner needs it and is otherwise a bullseye match.\r\n   * Poly with me is smooth sailing if you're on board.\r\n      * I have nine years of experience with ENM.\r\n      * I've fully or partially read several of the standard poly texts.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n      * Compersion comes naturally to me.  (Thank you, voyeurism kink?)  I can't remember a single time when I've felt romantically jealous of or threatened by a metamour.\r\n   * Meeting the right life partner matters more to me than filtering for ENM seekers.\r\n* I've survived much adversity in my life, and I've put tremendous effort toward post-traumatic growth.  My true peers are others with a rich history of character-building experiences.  [1, 2, 3]\r\n* My attachment style is Earned Secure.\r\n   * This tends to fail toward Disorganized or Anxious in the absence of reasonable emotional safety.\r\n   * I do mean “reasonable emotional safety” in a literal sense.  Treat me well and we're okay.\r\n   * I have survived severely abusive relationships, and I know what to look out for.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\r\nCalling all nuanced thinkers\r\n“The ancient oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks.\r\nIt is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.”\r\n—Socrates\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's my favorite quote from Civilization V.  😉\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual and emotional honesty take the cake in my value system.\r\n\r\n\r\nListening to diverse viewpoints, trying to empathize with others, sussing out the truth, sitting quietly with the finiteness of our knowledge, forming a responsible and carefully considered worldview, and holding skepticism toward our own biases are all deeply important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI profoundly disagree with the existence of yard signs that show a pre-bundled collection of political slogans, even when I support each of the stated positions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I read Bowling Alone, I became a dues-paying member of Braver Angels and volunteered with BA as an event organizer and host.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy ideal partner would fit Paul Graham's description of an “accidental moderate”.  The more you wonder about and vibe with life experiences outside your own, the more I'd like to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThematically related.  Swiped from an Astral Codex Ten post about the regulatory\r\nchallenges facing bioengineered mouth flora that promise to eliminate cavities.\r\n\r\nYe olde ambitions\r\nI want to net eight figures (or more) over my lifetime by being amazing at tech and startups with reasonably prosocial impact.  This has been a long throughline in my life.  I taught myself to code at age eight.  Then I skipped college and went straight to work at Google, at age twenty.  In the ten years since, I've been building my business acumen, inhaling technical knowledge, developing a grand unified theory of engineering productivity, and attempting startups intermittently.  None of them have taken off yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event of a wealth explosion: in addition to buying a lot of mosquito nets for charity, I'd like to create a beautiful, rejuvenating dwelling space that's quiet and green and close to a city and looks like something off Pinterest.  Maybe not just for me-and-mine—maybe an eco-village?  A giant attic in which to keep brilliant neurodivergent artists and inventors?\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurodivergent liberation, beginning with my own, is a much bigger theme for me than status games.  I get a bad feeling in my gut about win/lose status games (though I'm admittedly driven to seek others' admiration and fondness)—but I like living authentically and healthfully, and nurturing the same in the people whose lives I touch.  To the extent that those goals require resource abundance and social capital, they tend to get folded into conversations about status.  That can lead to some inner confusion, since I do have both a functioning limbic brain and a conscience that's skeptical as hell of it.  However, I'm clear that what I fundamentally want is the freedom and power to reject toxic environments (physical, social, and professional) and to design a bespoke life suited to my and my loved ones' needs.  Wealth, to me, means being able to breathe, even if my needs require resource investment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven with a more ordinary amount of capital in hand, I'm still serious about nesting as a primary life project.  Home should be a delightful place.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a young child, I wanted to be an “inventor”.  I wanted to create contact lenses that would grant eyesight to the blind, and a dynamic converter that would project a cartoonish force field using energy absorbed from local sound waves.  I've tabled those particular projects, but their spirit lives in me still.  🥼🧪🧑‍🔬🔧\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel curious about working with something more tangible than pixels and bytes.  Materials science sparks my imagination.  Could I create an eco-friendly material that beats plastic at its own game, at a lower price point?  Something that biodegrades into clean air, let's say?\r\n\r\n\r\nI also feel curious about moving deeper into the business side of the world.  I've been encouraged to contact leading MBA schools and ask whether they'd consider me as a nontraditional applicant.  The idea keeps boomeranging back into my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I can still make something of these dreams without disappearing entirely into the pages of Baby Blues.  If it takes time, it takes time.  It would be lovely to land in the kind of relationship where we can plan across decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI assure you, fam, I am a highly qualified Superloser.\r\nSome art I've made\r\nI took these photographs.  I take a lot of photographs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs any professional photographer will tell you, snapping photos is a perfect example of Superlosing.  You attempt a hundred shots in earnest to capture a single great one, and then you go home proud, with a camera roll full of 99% duds.  This is considered a good ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was sixteen, I collaborated with my best friend to compose a progressive-metal instrumental track.  The piece was stylistically inspired by a band called “Animals as Leaders”, which you should definitely check out.  We titled our track Amaranthine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write poems.\r\nIf I like you, I will write you a poem.\r\nBem's androgyny, y'all\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe more I look at that mise-en-place, the more I wonder\r\nwhat she plans to do with the ladle.  Defense, maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nSandra Bem’s androgyny framework is the actual bee’s knees.  Here’s the rundown:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are culturally tagged “masculine” and “feminine” modalities of thought, feeling, and behavior.\r\nA fully developed human has mindfully cultivated both in themself through a combination of deliberate self-work and acquiring varied life experiences.\r\nThat human is the Avatar of shitty gender constructs, bending all the elements at once:\r\ncompetence and warmth, yin and yang, nurturance and agency, assertiveness and receptivity…\r\nAccording to Dr. Bem, they've risen to the rank of “androgynous”, the peak of human potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Bem came up with this idea and developed research tools to measure people on a two-axis system of “femininity” and “masculinity”, with the really cool people landing in the upper-right quadrant, high on both scales.  Those folks can display “situational appropriateness” across a wide variety of contexts, either by switching modes or by blending both modes at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nBem’s androgyny feels like a cousin to two of my other favorite ideas in philosophy, which are the golden mean (watching out for “too much” and “too little” in literally all things) and Hegelian dialectics (thesis/antithesis/synthesis).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, am I masculine?  That’s a very solid “yes-and”.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the final minutes of an attempt at a sub-5:30 mile, I prayed to the departed ghost of my Marine grandfather for the strength to endure and exceed my body's limits—and I clocked in at 5:24, shaking, on the verge of heaving, but triumphant.  I'm excellent with technical systems.  I achieved the competitive rank of Onyx in Halo 5.  For projects that really matter (and some that don't), I plan carefully using numbers and spreadsheets.  I lift weights.  The old Teddy Roosevelt quote stirs my heart and lights a fire in me.  I like making my loved one feel safe and protected and provided-for (so long as I'm not over-parentified by my peer).\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve also cried unabashedly at the songs in Steven Universe, which I purchased season-by-season in its entirety.  The lyrics of “Love Like You”—if you know, you know.  Visually, I'm obsessed with color.  I want to be aesthetically beautiful and to create beauty around me.  I'm captivated by sensations and will visibly surrender to joy when I look out over the hills, snuggle up under a soft blanket, or take the first bite of a good meal.  As I mentioned earlier, my special interest (other than deck-builders and approximately every subject in nonfiction) is relationships and feelings.  I'm a cat whisperer and absolutely melt for kitties, baby talk and all.  And I want someone to kiss me like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you spend time on the parts of Reddit where this\r\nsort of image gets posted, please send me a message.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could be an appropriate partner for (among other sorts) a cishet AFAB who is herself holistically developed, and honors and craves the same breadth and depth in her male partner.  Historically, most of my partners have been bi+ and neurodivergent, so the gender thing took a back seat to a grounded notion of compatibility and like-mindedness.  In any case, if you like what you see, I would be glad to hear from you.  Just understand that policing my “masculinity” would be grounds to end the relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this has bearing on family life!\r\nCatch me teaching grit, agency, and excellence to my future kids, hopefully by modeling these myself.\r\nAlso catch me spoiling those kiddos with bottomless emotional attention, attunement, and co-regulation—which I expect to model just as much in my relationship with my spouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nI greatly value some kind of bend toward Bem’s androgyny in others.\r\nIn AMABs, that usually looks like culturally conspicuous EQ and warmth (with their agency and excellence taken for granted by society).\r\nIn AFABs, it usually looks like culturally conspicuous agency and excellence (with their EQ and warmth taken for granted by society).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCan we please teach this to all preschoolers, regardless of sex?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more hot take:\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve developed a view that temperament and neurotype really are what gender is cracked up to be.  People empirically differ in their essential, embodied natures—meaning blank slatism is false—but the pink/blue bucket system is a stain on our culture.  Temperament and neurotype show uncountable natural variations, giving rise to “endless forms most beautiful and strange” among individuals.  People are best bucketed by their contextually relevant distinctions (I call them “CoRDs”), which vary completely from one context to the next.  Reproductive sex class is almost never a CoRD, unless we're actually talking about intercourse or family planning!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth about a person’s talents, instincts, and proclivities dwells in that person, and the optimally developed version of that person is bespoke and exists independently of cultural archetypes.  I don't know, nor do I expect ever to know, what traits statistically correlate with reproductive sex class at a population level in a truly culture-fair society.  I do know that if you're dealing with (for example) a young Norah Vincent, who, as an AFAB child in the early 1970's, persisted doggedly in wearing jeans and climbing trees despite every imaginable social pressure to the contrary, then you love and embrace that lil’ lesbian tomboy from the bottom of your heart.  And for goodness's sake, can we please make heroes rather than martyrs of our highly sensitive AMAB children?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this means for parenting is: I’m going to let my kids show me what their natural talents and interests are, and then I’m going to nurture those without too much editorializing.  (Yes, rooting out bias and subtle influences is a hard problem, but still.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe user selects negative-one genders, and the fortress bursts into flames.\r\nCase study: BayHouseWarming\r\nIn 2021, as I was moving from Seattle back to the Bay Area, I tried founding a group house with 4–6 ambitious residents from among my friend group.  I affectionately called this project the Bay House.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy vision was to gather folks who would positively peer-pressure each other to achieve their dreams more proactively, in a warm and nurturing environment where we all enjoyed one another, shared meals, kept up with each other's lives, and did activities together.  (Looking back three years later, I recognize this as a variation of “family”, which I now call one of my core values.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI shot for the moon and landed in the treetops: I succeeded in establishing the house with a total of 3 residents, plus a fourth who visited for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took on sole responsibility for furnishing our new nest—everything from budgeting to design to logistics.  When one housemate's parents came to see the place, they pulled me aside and said, “You put all this together?  This is not some bachelor-pad setup.  This is a grown-up house,” nodding with a raised brow.  That's still one of my favorite compliments I've ever received.\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to plan and host a housewarming party, hoping to knit together different parts of my friend group and establish the house as a social venue.  Naturally, I named the party “BayHouseWarming”.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still have the planning sheet in my personal archives:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIs this “masculine” or “feminine”?  You tell me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unchecked items got done in time; I just never went back to check the checkboxes.  By then, the list had served its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also made this document to help track food prep.  It's an early example of what I now call [pun redacted]—my personal survival tool for C.W.N. (cooking while neurodivergent).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the rest of the story in photos:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe appetizers turned out delicious.\r\n(The cans are all soft drinks, most with low sugar.\r\nI'm a lifelong teetotaler; all my parties are dry.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI make frequent efforts to share my love of hot sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nReady for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake it double.  (Or sextuple.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNametags, just as the sheet foretold!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe crew's all here.  The whiteboard mounted over the hearth was lots of fun—\r\nevery time a visitor came over, something new would appear on it.\r\nWe got poems, lewd drawings, people's hopes and dreams, more lewd drawings…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA chessboard is to some of my friends as a paper bag is to cats.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring the chess match, one of the spectators started\r\ndrawing the other guests on paper plates.  I have no\r\nidea where the palette came from.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMain course: vegan chili and cornbread.\r\nI'm a “reducetarian” myself, and it's always easier to plan\r\nmeals for large groups by defaulting to a vegan menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt was the kind of dinner you'd want to eat outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is why.  The view from the back deck that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs intended, the party set the stage for many afternoons of four-square…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n…with the good ol' crew…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n…plus many evenings of Telestrations…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t…which got pretty wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the Telestrations booklet responsible for those reactions.\r\nWilliam (far left above) saw only page 4, then drew page 5, and was VERY pleased with my guess on page 6.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSex and other wonderful things\r\nIs it bad form to talk about sex in a dating doc?\r\n\r\n\r\n…No.\r\n\r\n\r\n…Maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's settle for a middle ground.  Here are some books I've read attentively:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Magnificent Sex: Lessons from Extraordinary Lovers by Peggy J. Kleinplatz and A. Dana Ménard\r\n   * (HIGHLY recommend!)\r\n* Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski\r\n* She Comes First by Ian Kerner\r\n* Rethinking Sex by Christine Emba\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll save most of my steamy shares for a later time.  Here's just one for now:\r\nI have a strong track record of creating a reverse orgasm gap in my relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're my sweetie, I will learn all the ways you like to be touched, both in and out of bed.  😘\r\nI care a lot about this!  In a fully selfish sense, I come alive by making you come alive.  There’s nothing better than a partner's joy.\r\nOn good terms with my ex\r\nAt 23, I met and fell in love with a very charming human, who is now working on her own dating doc, which will get a solid endorsement from me.  [UPDATE: Here it is.]\r\nThat relationship continued for about eight years.  We lived together for four of those years, then moved apart.\r\nFinally, we decided that we had irreconcilable differences and it wouldn't make sense for us to marry.  Our paths have disentangled somewhat, and we’re currently in a cooling-off period of low contact, but this person is still like family to me and to my relatives.\r\nExpect her to continue playing a role in my life!  She’ll likely appear at family gatherings in the future.  It’s possible she’ll be “Auntie Alicia” to my kids.\r\nHow I'm searching\r\nUsing dateme.directory, I ran a database query for every F and NB doc worldwide.  (My data cutoff was 2024-04-14.)  Then I carefully read all 130 of them, skipping one.  That part took a total of 10 hours.  I built a spreadsheet as I went, recording my feelings about each doc on a dual 7-point scale—separately measuring the strength of my positive response and the strength of my negative response.  Both scales work like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n7—overwhelmingly present\r\n6—clearly present\r\n5—weakly present\r\n4—ambivalent or unclear\r\n3—weakly absent\r\n2—clearly absent\r\n1—overwhelmingly absent\r\n\r\n\r\nI recorded my data in normalized form so I could write relational queries.\r\nThen I wrote a query to generate a bubble chart visualizing the frequencies of different score pairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I look at the size of the 5/6, 6/6, and 7/6 bubbles,\r\na certain Taylor Swift song starts playing in my head.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also wrote a query to grab the data records forming the lower-right portion of the chart (high positive scores, low negative scores) and sort them in a certain way.  That tells me which docs to revisit at length.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom there, intuition takes the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you get an outreach message from me, know that a lot of forethought and appreciation went into it, and I've been spending lots of quality time with your writing!  😊\r\nContact info\r\nIf anything in this doc has inspired you to say hello, pen a spicy response, ask me out on a date, or just be my pal, you're warmly invited to do either of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Text me at two zero six, two two five, seven zero four two\r\n* Email me at: langhisc at [DELETE THIS] gmail [DELETE THIS] dot com\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you try one method and you don't get a response, please try the other.  As long as this doc is published and visible, I'll try to acknowledge every message I receive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for making it this far!  Have a blessed rest of your existence, dear reader.  ✨"

      "fullText": "﻿Date Kerry!\r\nHi, I’m Kerry!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a lighthearted intellectual with dad energy, who likes to be serious and playful all at once. I appreciate thought-provoking conversations, folkways, and every kind of beauty.\r\n\r\nMy current projects:\r\n* Seeking a monogamous marriage to start a family\r\n* DIY upgrading my house and creating a beautiful yard and garden\r\n* Trying to start a blog and generally publish more work\r\n* Doing computational geometry and cloud backend software at a geology startup\r\n* Running a rationalist meetup\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m like:\r\nI’m extroverted and sociable, and I like making new friends and meeting new people. I like dinner parties and hosting events, and I’m constantly moving in and out of little jokey improv bits. My friends and I often get together for silly events and private game shows, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI get really into learning about subjects that catch my fancy. Some current examples include: How do Aristotle’s virtue ethics hold up in light of Darwinian evolution? Are there cool garden hacks to let me grow more plants in Colorado? Why do Karl Popper’s fans claim empiricism is wrong? What does societal collapse look like, and are we experiencing one? What will LLM-based agents look like, and how will they act? How is there a whole volume of Robin Hood ballads when I’ve only ever heard the one with the peddler?\r\n\r\n\r\nI really want to have a big family. I understand that in parenting, as in battle, no plan survives contact with the enemy, but I’m low-key thinking that five children sounds good.  I’m open to more, but we are not a good match if you want fewer than three kids. A dog would be nice, too\r\n\r\n\r\nI love making music. I play saxophone in a chiptune band, and occasionally strum murder ballads or Americana songs on my guitar. I used to sing baritone in choirs in and out of school and am thinking about getting back to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to be outdoors and the wilder the better. Hiking and skiing and camping restore me to myself. Delight is U-shaped valleys, geologic strata, and cliff-nestled glacial lakes. Sometimes I will bring a recorder to the mountains and play songs for the forest creatures. I’m a big fan of backyard chilling around a fire pit, and of road tripping to national parks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn between all that, I read many books, drink fancy cocktails, and play games with friends. I also write, though that’s new and should still perhaps be considered aspirational. I’m still figuring out how to (and how much to) rebalance my time away from ephemera (socializing, outdoors, learning, travel, experiences, weak relationships) into more durable things (published work, communities, strong relationships, traditions, a family, and maybe a startup)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpicy stuff:\r\nPolitics:\r\nOnce a progressive, now I’d self-describe as a classical liberal informed by cultural evolution.  Center-right, if you insist on a 1-D coordinate, but I’m not attached to the label. I try (sometimes unsuccessfully) to avoid the culture war; I’d rather focus on living well, controlling the things I can, and connecting to my community.\r\n\r\nReligion:\r\nI spent the last decade as an atheist and was surprised this year to discover that God is real after all. So now I’m figuring out what it means to be a Christian again. I’m looking for someone who is, even if not a believer yourself, then willing to live in a way informed by Christian teaching. I’m still figuring out exactly what this means for me, feeling out denominations, and searching for the right community. I was raised Catholic and always loved the sacraments, the liturgy, and the high-church aesthetics, but there are some doctrinal issues that I’m not sure whether I’ll be able to come to terms with.\r\n\r\nSex:\r\nOpen-minded and I like experimenting, but I also don’t need weird stuff to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship with me:\r\n- Monogamous marriage. I want to build a life with one other person, and make decisions as a unit of two.\r\n- Touch is my primary love language. I am very physically affectionate, and I love to receive affection in turn. We shall exchange many kisses and enjoy many cuddles.\r\n- Good communication. I try to be explicit and to over- rather than under-communicate. I am pretty good at picking up on weird emotions or social dynamics in the interest of improving/avoiding them for next time\r\n- I am gender euphoric and I think leaning into gender roles is great. That said, I’ve had to learn a lot of my gender performance explicitly, like an autist. I like being the leader in the subtle leader/follower thing that develops in heterosexual relationships. Ideally, you like being the follower here, and you’re willing to explicitly communicate about this stuff sometimes so we can grow better for each other over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities I like doing together:\r\n- Visiting museums or galleries\r\n- Walking and talking\r\n- Outdoor adventures (hikes, campouts, ski weekends, scenic drives, etc)\r\n- Exploring and refining ideas, or critiquing books/movies\r\n- Hosting and attending barbecues and their winter counterpart, the dinner party\r\n- Traveling to new places/cities/countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a woman:\r\n- Someone who loves learning, talking about ideas, and seeking out new ones\r\n- Someone who is kind and fair-minded\r\n- Someone who is family-oriented and ready for kids. IE, excited to be a mother, and intending to make raising a family the major ongoing project of our lives until the kids are grown. Certainly not alone! I intend to be actively involved too. But other things should be sidequests while the kids are at home.\r\n- Someone who wants to live in a Christian-informed way, meaning regular(ish) church attendance, holidays, and taking scripture seriously-but-not-literally. (It’s okay with me if you believe God is literally real, as long as you’re okay with the possibility that I may never quite get there.)\r\n- Someone who is politically tolerant. We don’t have to agree (though it would be nice), but it deeply bothers me when someone I’m close to casually and habitually treats political opponents as being uniformly stupid and/or evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNice-to-have bonuses that definitely aren’t dealbreakers:\r\n- Interest in being a housewife or stay-at-home-mom. I think this is a noble and worthy vocation, and I have the means to make it work.\r\n- Interested in making music together\r\n- Being actively outdoorsy and having a fondness for wilderness\r\n- Being sweet and sassy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we might be a good match, drop me a line at kerrydatemedoc@gmail.com, and let’s get to know each other! I live in Colorado but work remotely and travel frequently, so I’d like to come visit you if we hit it off. I’m aiming to start a family sooner rather than later, and am somewhat open to relocating for the right person.\r\n________________\r\nHere are some more photos of me. I’m 6’3” and I had long hair until this year, when I cut it off."

But here’s the kicker: I was born 3 months early and therefore have cerebral palsy and mobility issues. Likely undiagnosed autistic as I struggle with social cues and have the physical compulsion to correct things people say (you can correct me too <3 )\nKids:\nI have always wanted kids although I fully appreciate that could be unfair on you given above, ( got lot’s of family members too) but of course it would be an adventure I’d give my all.\nOccupation:\nIT Developer\nEducation:\nBSc in ICT\nNationality:\nBritish, sadly no Welsh and the Welsh are cool\nHeight:\n5’ 6”\nPolitics:\nA mix of left and right wing positions like any honest normal person.\nEveryone has some opinion that is offensive to someone :)\nOn my values:\nI value clear communication and honesty hoping we can make good memories and laughs together.\nOn going out:\nI consider myself an introvert with certain extroverted tendencies. Other people would be surprised at this as my mind is constantly going and I get a thrill from acting and public speaking.\nBut sometimes I need to switch off listening to an audio book, watch YouTube TV or read.\nBest music:\nNickelback\nBusted\nClassic Avril Lavigne\nClassic Fall Out Boy\nBest films:\nShrek 2\nThe Incredibles\nJohnny English\nBest writer:\nStephen King\nBest games\nLocal couch co-op (Play with me <3)\nOn family ties:\nIf my future partner is extremely close to their family, that would be awesome, but also not at all necessary.\nOn food:\nDon’t try to make me vegan.

Consent is sexy.\nFirmly of the opinion sex is meant to be funny as well as hot/exciting.\nOn my ideal partner:\nWhen we’ve dated for a while assuming you don’t hate me I may share my horny 14 year old perfect woman list. But to paraphrase boyzone, that's not anyone and who cares.\nFears:\nThat I might not do my best\nI’ll get nervous. I either talk fast, stutter or shut down.\nThat I enjoy being drunk and I do\nOther normal insecurities\nRed flags:\nStill live with parents in your 30s?! In my defense I always imagined I would move out with my future.\nKids section a bit too forward\nHow disabled? What are we talking about\nWhat political opinions? HOW LIKE ME ARE YOU\nI don’t have any offensive opinions\nTerrible taste in music/films IN YOUR OPINION\nYou won’t date a vegan?! No, I won't date a pushy vegan. Do you hate animals? No\nWhy did you talk about nudism in the on sex section? Nudism is not about sex. I agree, it seemed like the best cheeky place to put it.\nSounds/ looks like he’d be crap in bed. How rude?

Se vuoi la versione in italiano, clicca qui\n📷 Pics\n✅ Let’s start from the basics\nName: Omar\nAge: 31 (I may look younger, but I’m not lying about my age, I swear 😁)\nGender: M\nHeight: 174 cm\nOrientation: hetero-romantic is the right word, for the rest…\nLocation: Northern Italy 🇮🇹 (quite close to Bologna)\nLanguages: Italian, English, a bit of French\nLooking for: dates, then who knows\nRelationship style: monogamous, I guess\nZodiac sign: Pisces, Libra Rising, Scorpio Moon\nMBTI Type: INFJ\nEnneagram: 4w5\nReligion: giving you a hint at the bottom of this doc\nPolitics: apolitical, there’s never anything good to say\nJob: currently unemployed\n🧡 Favourites\nSeason: spring\nTV series:\nBand: HIM (guarda sotto)\nMovie: Nightmare Before Christmas\nVideogame: Final Fantasy X\nManga: Berserk\n🎸 Hobbies\nplaying videogames\nreading mangas\nhaving a love-hate relationship with coding (or at least, trying to treat it as a hobby)\nlistening to music (mostly rock/metal); here are some of my favourite songs\nplaying the guitar and the bass\ncomposing music; here’s my solo musical project Cavaliere della Rosa Rossa ( = Italian for “Knight of the Red Rose”)\n⭕ What I find valuable\nDisplays of affection: I’m a huggy person 👉👈 (be careful: I’m not a teddy bear haha)\nDedication: you could tell me anything about “passion yada-yada-yada”, but think about it: what is a relationship — ANY kind of relationship — without proper dedication?\nHaving things in common: not necessary but surely won’t hurt, actually they might be chances to spend some time together 😄\n“Little gestures”: even a simple “I’m happy with you” can really mean more to me than its apparent simplicity\nSpontaneity: last (but not least), I like texting but if we’re happy together even strolling together listening to music with an earphone each is somehing wonderful; on the other hand, even the most apparently chic date without that “je-ne-sais-quoi” isn’t something I’d go on with\n❌ My big “no-no”s\nJealousy. I’m not a jealous person myself (which doesn’t mean I don’t care about the other person, but that I’m not the “WhereUAtWhatchaDoinWhoUWith???” guy) and I can’t stand jealousy at all. I expect back the same trust I give.\nLack of respect. Should be self-explanatory, but I need to add a point: I may not be the smartest or wittiest person in the world, but this doesn’t give you the right to talk me as I’m a complete dumb.\nGhosting. I can understand if you change your mind (you absolutely have the right to) and don’t want to date me / know me any more, but being left in a limbo outta nowhere is a horrible sensation, so PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE. TELL ME IF YOU WANNA STEP OUT. I’ll be doing the same should I be the one who wants to step out.\n“Always-on-men”. I’m not a friggin’ ATM, so don’t expect me to pay every single time.\nDiet. I’m open to dating veg* people as long as they respect the fact that I’m not. So if it’s a problem to you, sorry but I’m definitely the wrong person for you.\nKids. Sorry, but if you already have kids or want them in the future, I’m definitely the wrong person for you.\nMarriage. Same speech.\n📱 Contact\n👉\nTelegram\nInstagram\nE-mail (don’t expect an immediate reply here tho)\nJust make sure you use the hashtag #JustReadYourDateMeDoc (on the subject if you e-mail me) on your message so I understand 😉\nOh, and link me / send me your “Date-me doc”, if you have one! 😊\nThe reality is that ideal love is only possible between two independent, mature and sincere people. Therefore, it is essential that you first decide to improve yourselves. If you feel from the bottom of your heart in your relationship that you are not regarded as you should be, I hope you have the courage and dignity to break off such an unhappy relationship. True love does not come between two people who smother each other; it can only come between two strong people who are sure of their individuality. A superficial person will only have superficial relationships. If you want to experience true love, it is important first to sincerely develop a strong identity. True love is certainly not doing what the other person wants, or trying to be what you are not. If someone loves you deeply, he or she will never push you to act against your will or involve you in anything dangerous for you.\nDaisaku Ikeda"

If that might be you, and the description below sounds intriguing, get in touch!\n🎂\n39 📏 6’2”📍LES/NYC 👶 No kids yet but excited to have some with the right woman!\nTable of Contents\nQuestions I’m likely to ask you on a first date\nThings I’ve accomplished (roughly chronologically)\nInterests\nAttributes/Things that I am\nValues\nWhat I’d like to bring to/create in a relationship\nGet in touch!\nGallery\nQuestions I’m likely to ask you on a first date\nI’m not much for small talk; here’s a sampling of the kind of thing I’ll want to talk about if we go on a date.\nWhat’s your heresy? Or put differently, what’s an opinion you hold that a community you consider yourself a member of would consider anathema?\nWhen’s the last time you changed your mind about something important?\nWhat’s something you’re an expert in? Like top 1% globally?\nIf you were empress of NYC for a day, what change or policy would you enact to make it a better city for the next 100 years? Think about actual policy levers, not magic-wand sorts of things.\nTell me a story about a trip you took that taught you most about yourself (or reality)\nWho are your heroes? Who do you routinely read/pay attention to?\nWhat do you aspire to?\nThings I’ve accomplished (roughly chronologically)\nIn 7th grade I won the City of Madison spelling bee. I still resent  “pica”, the word I lost on at the state competition, as well as “pika” - the adorable animal homonym - out of spite.\nMe (second from right) coordinating with local counterparts.\nALT\nIn my final year of undergrad, I redesigned a water supply system in Ecuador. After graduation, I flew down with my team and built it! We organized ~400 volunteers over a week and a half to enlarge sections of pipe, install valves and meters, and restore equitable access to a water supply system that served 5 villages in the hills above Otovalo. I also managed a sewer project in El Salvador through Engineers Without Borders.\nI spent 2 years living and working in Uganda as a Peace Corps Volunteer. While there, I started this company, still operating - some of my proudest work!\nStarted a machine-learning startup (now defunct) with my best friend\nOne of my favorite economists, Arnold Kling, ran a Fantasy Intellectual Teams competition. I am the undefeated champion\nWhen I went to Azerbaijan in 2023, I enjoyed their national dish (Shakh Plov) so much, I taught myself how to make it when I came home.\nInterests\nReading See below for my “holy canon”, but I’m constantly reading great sci-fi or history related to an upcoming trip\nTravel I’m in an informal competition with my dad to visit the most countries. My current count is 50. This year (2024) I’m planning trips to Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Taiwan, China, Poland, Germany, Czechia, Austria and maybe Pakistan. In 2023 I visited Senegal, Norway, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Sweden, Hungary, and Slovakia.\nUncle-ing It’s my great honor to be “Uncle Jon” to 3 kids of my close friends. I can’t wait to be a dad of my own, but in the meantime I take great delight in being the funcle.\nBoard games  Every August I buy (and get mildly obsessed with) that year’s board game of the year, and I host a monthly-ish gathering of friends for food and games.\nRoad trips/camping/hiking My trusty steed (above) is named Dawn Treader, and she is the finest roadtripmobile in all the land. We have ~50,000 miles together. I’ll never say no to a new national park, though I indulged that hobby a bit more when I lived in Seattle.\nBeauty I try to bring something beautiful back from every country I visit, and infuse a small bit of what caught my eye there into some part of my daily life. Sometimes it’s a painting, or a knicknack for my shelf, or a recipe I learn. Very often, my aesthetic taste inclines toward the hexagonal.\nAttributes/Things that I am\nEngineer. I hold a masters degree in Civil Engineering, and though I’ve long since turned my career to IT Product Leadership, I still think of myself fundamentally as a problem-solver and builder.\nEmotionally Stable I’m reliable and steadfast - even on my crappiest of days, I stick to my values and show up for my important relationships.\nAdventurous  …but not an adrenaline junky. I haven’t jumped out of any perfectly good airplanes, but I’m 70% sure I could land one in an emergency. Exploring the unknown (in a city, in a country, in a woman, in the past) lights me up. These words from Tennyson resonate with me:\n“I am a part of all that I have met;\nYet all experience is an arch wherethro'\nGleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades\nFor ever and forever when I move.\nHow dull it is to pause, to make an end,\nTo rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!”\nMinimalist Twice I’ve shrunk my possessions down to what could fit in my car. I also take enormous joy in finding the perfect object of any kind - be it travel shoe, backpack, or camping equipment. I can comfortably travel for 5 weeks with only a 10lb backpack.\nValues\nCuriosity - There is very little that disinterests me. I particularly love encountering new phenomenon and learning all I can about it. One of my favorites is to pair reading with my travel - brushing up on the last thousand years or so of that place, trying to figure out what makes it special.\nLoyalty  - My 5 oldest friendships are an average of 20 years old. When I find people I Iike, I do all I can to build durable relationships.\nPragmatic Incrementalism - If I have an overriding philosophy, it’s this. A little bit better today is better than a lot better maybe never. Move at the margin, the perfect is the enemy of the good, get 80% of returns from 20% of inputs, compounding returns are your friend.\nEnlightenment Values - Steven Pinker’s “Enlightenment Now” is on my holy books list because it’s been profoundly influential to my thought. I’d like a partner who shares (or at least enthusiastically tolerates) my belief in the idea of an abundant future. My desired political outcomes skew to the neo-liberal. In the US, I’m politically homeless but especially tribeless, and I proudly identify as a heretic.\nNuance - I strive to be an independent, first-principles thinker. I split hairs with wild abandon. I pay attention to dozens of writers, podcasters, youtubers, and academics - none of whom I agree with on all topics. I’m much more interested in a thriving intellectual atmosphere where outstanding participants can debate in good faith. The GMU economics department is my favorite idea lab.\nWhat I’d like to bring to/create in a relationship\nPermanence - I’m looking for a partner for the rest of my life. I was married before (happy to talk about what happened, but not on the internet), but I’m serious about finding one person to grow old with. I’m a believer in the committed, monogamous relationship both for raising kids as well as building a relationship that works for us both.\nGoodness - One of my fundamental relationship values/aspirations is that partners should be as good to each other as they can possibly manage. I’d like us to be one of those couples that amasses such a wealth of good will aimed at each other that it becomes contagious, a beautiful bubble of relationship somewhat insulated from reality but still embedded in it such that we bend the universe around us. I don’t need or desire that relationship to be all-consuming, but I want it to be strong and stable enough to survive (and even thrive in) the demand of our future toddler(s) that the universe revolve around them.  I think few people would openly disagree with this sentiment, but I mean it in the deepest possible sense. I’m looking for a relationship where we are both seriously committed to co-creating a life full of joy for each other, and that means taking our differences seriously, and getting really good at negotiating shared and separate spaces that meet our needs.\nPartnership - I’m open to most manifestations of roles in child rearing/household management and income generation. I’m actively looking forward to being a father and supportive partner. Ideally we’d have a 30-70% overlap in shared interests such that its enjoyable to be together “by default”.\nGet in touch!\nIf this sounds interesting to you, get in touch! I’m not looking for a long distance relationship (i.e. it’d be great if you’re in NYC) but maybe you’re the one to convince me otherwise.\nGallery\nAdd an image"

That they made this \"hang out with your friends BB-8 and Chewy\" rather than straight-up cult indoctrination into the Jedi religion is unforgivable\r\n2. “You miss NaN of the shots you don’t take”. Wait no that’s not right, it’s not 0/0, it’s n/0 – “You miss Infinity of the shots you don’t take”. Wait that’s not right either, it’s actually just n/n, AKA 100%, AKA the conventional saying was right all along 😛\r\n3. How open should I be with various friends in various contexts? Where are the lines between sharing, exploring, over-sharing, holding things back in ways that create fun tension?\r\n4. Well shit, now that we finished the climb, we’re on top of a fin of rock with cliffs on both sides – how do we get down?\r\n5. AI for epistemics is great and all, but what about AI for coordination and political stability?\r\n6. Quintal voicings on piano! And the “harmonic experimentation” sitting down at the piano that led me to “discover” them\r\n7. Textbook, you say that isometric mappings are linear, and you show that they preserve sums. But what about scalar multiples?!? How can you just not address that at all?!?\r\nStuff I’m into\r\nOutdoors/exercise\r\nI go backpacking in the Sierras a few times a year – I’ve recently gotten into hiking up from the east side, going off trail, and wandering around the basins, ~as described in this excellent book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI go climbing in the gym and outside, often sport at Mount Saint Helena and occasionally trad in the Sierras.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love mountain biking when I’m back home in Tucson, but I haven’t bought a bike yet in the Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy hiking, tennis, soccer, Spikeball, and weightlifting.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn most days I do one of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation etc.\r\nI do concentration meditation most days, and I’m in a weekly circling/relatefulness group. I used to go on meditation retreats fairly often but recently I’ve been going on noble silence solo backpacking trips in the Sierras, which have been excellent.\r\nMusic\r\nI play jazz-adjacent piano. I rehearse with my band every week. Here we are playing one of my tunes, and here we are playing my arrangement of one of my favorite pop songs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy jamming with friends and singalongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m trying to accomplish in the world\r\nAI is rapidly getting smarter, and I expect it to have a huge impact on the course of world events in the coming years. My main professional goal is to make that impact as positive as possible. I’m pursuing that goal by working at Elicit, a startup that’s building an AI research assistant to do literature review. I hope that AI-assisted research can give everyone access to high quality evidence and reasoning, and help us work together to make wise decisions, agreements, contracts, and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelatedly, I’m an Effective Altruist:\r\n1. I used to work on alleviating global poverty\r\n2. I’m ~vegetarian\r\n3. I’m into some weird subcultural stuff e.g. date-me docs 😛\r\n\r\n\r\nUs\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a relationship\r\nI’m looking for a very long-term, marriage or marriage-adjacent life partner\r\n\r\n\r\nKids?\r\nIn short: probably but flexible\r\n\r\n\r\nI can imagine living a good and fulfilling life without kids with the right partner; I can also imagine living a good and fulfilling life with kids with the right partner. The latter feels more straightforward and easier to imagine.\r\nMono vs. poly?\r\nIn short: ~mono\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve done both and both have worked for me. I lean towards ~monogamy but with flexibility so it’s not a disaster if after some years we go through a spot of not being attracted to each other. Strict monogamy also OK, poly OK with the right person. I am very non-jealous, FYI\r\nPersonal qualities\r\n1. I’m very loyal, I stick with friends and partners. I try hard to make things work in relationships. I’d like you to be pretty loyal as well. On the flip side I hope we can both stay loyal to ourselves and only move forward with deepening a relationship if it’s the right thing for each of us\r\n2. I’m pretty honest – I’m ~never actively dishonest, and I’m more on the side of over-honesty and over-sharing than keeping things to myself. I need you to be pretty honest and ~never actively dishonest or deceptive. I’d be quite interested in an excruciatingly open/honest relationship, though I’m also happy with normal levels of openness and honesty\r\n3. Relatedly, I’m quite interested in exploring my and other peoples’ emotions/hearts/souls. I’m in the middle of my journey on this one. 5 years ago I was below average at feeling, understanding, and working with feelings. I think I’m now roughly average, I’d like to be extremely good\r\n4. I’m pretty smart. I know about lots of different domains and I’m also pretty good at figuring stuff out. I’d like you to also be pretty smart\r\n5. I’m extremely high-openness. Probably won’t work unless you’re also fairly high-openness.\r\n6. I think I take in and interact with the world in my own weird, surprising, and beautiful way and I think I bring lots of joy to how I interact with myself, others, and the world. Looking for someone who does the same but in their own way\r\n7. I’m trying to accomplish some stuff in the world. It’s not important to me that you are, exactly, but I tend to get along better with people who are\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\nAt datebenrachbach@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to just send me a quick ping to take a look at your dating doc/dating profile :)"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi! If you’re seeing this, odds are you’re a woman who is attracted to men and wants or is open to kids, and filtered according to those criteria on the Date Me Directory of dating docs! And if you did that, you’ve probably noticed- \r\n\r\n\r\n-wow! There’s a lot of people! Large number of people! Lot of profiles to look at! That’s a lot of reading to do! Are you gonna read all that? Maybe not! Maybe you need to make a quick decision about whether to read any further! Let me help you out with some\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\r\n* 30 years old\r\n* heterosexual(ish) man(ish) \r\n* flexible on mono/poly\r\n* 5’11” (181cm), 190lb (86kg)\r\n* wants one or more kids\r\n* Rhode Island, USA, willing to travel\r\n* software developer, WFH, most recent salary $115k/year\r\n* atheist, ratsphere\r\n* politically like, weird complicated center-left-lib utopian\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, cool. None of those things are dealbreakers? You want to know more? Cool. Very nice. Here’s another thing that might help you make some decisions:\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE’S WHAT I LOOK LIKE\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hair situation is less than ideal for me, as it impedes a certain wise wrestleman’s sacred commandment that you gotta have blue hair, but unfortunately the family genetics are merciless in that department. C’est la vie. I compensate by wearing blue everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, one thing that’s important to me is- do you like that? Do you see that and think, “oh, hey, that looks good, I am attracted to that, it would make me happy to smooch that”? Because, like, I dated an ace partner for a while and it turns out it does a number on one’s self-esteem to not have your partner think your body is attractive. \r\nIf you do like that body, then- hey, thanks! That means a lot to me. Please continue reading this document, and maybe you will discover that it would be a good idea to interact with that body!\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES THIS GUY MAINLY DO?\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I play a lot of video games.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the fact that I mention this first is a red flag for you, you might wanna move on. I’m not, like, the guy addicted to grinding loot in some MMO, games don’t take over my life- but they are a good chunk of my cultural context. I have a lot to say about them, I grew up with them, they’re a major way I connect with people, and I make them as a hobby. It’s pretty important to me that my partner is someone I can talk to about the things that make me excited, and it’d be ideal if you are also interested in and excited about video games. I would ideally like to be able to make my partner happy by acting the way I normally act!\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, it’s not just video games with me. I have lots of other interests! Maybe too many. I also read webcomics and fanfic and play tabletop games and watch anime, that whole cluster of very-online interests. Sometimes I even watch movies or read books! Wild stuff. When I consume media I like to discuss it to death with people, and if you also like to discuss media to death then we might be a good fit!\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from consuming various sorts of media and working my day job, I…\r\n* Make video games\r\n* Draw things\r\n* Write fiction\r\n* Sort of do all three at once collaboratively (run RPGs)\r\n\r\nYou might notice a theme here wherein these are all just the production of the same things I spend the rest of my time consuming! It’s an endless cycle! Dare you date an ouroboros?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that’s the main thing, isn’t it? Like, what are you in for if you attach your life to mine? Because creating is important to me, and I have limited capacity to compromise on it. The prime directive is to create until nothing is left to create, and the universe bursts with an overworked sigh. The number one thing I’m looking for is someone who can support that, and is happy to support that. If you’re also a creative, and we can feed on each other’s energy and reinforce each other- that’s the dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ABOUT SEX AND RELATIONSHIP STUFF THOUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nOh jeez. Maybe you were curious about the heterosexual “ish” in the bio? Thing is, I definitely experience heterosexual attraction strongly, but the sex bits of human bodies seem kinda… gross? The whole affair seems kinda unsanitary and unappealing. Crucially, though, I haven’t tried it, and I hear it feels great despite how it looks (also you need to do it to have kids), and I’m willing to take that on faith and figure out a way to have fun with it- so I don’t know if I’d self-describe as sex-repulsed or asexual. You’re not dealing with a high sex drive but I am pretty much down for whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith monogamy and polyamory- I sort of prefer poly, but not for the standard reasons. On the relationship side of things… I have clear weaknesses as a partner. I’m bad at consoling and dealing with sadness, I get absorbed in ambitious projects and am jealous of my own time, so… like, if I’m failing to support you in some way and you can get some backup support from someone else, great! And on the sex side of things, modern contraceptive technology exists and so I don’t really experience jealousy (so long as I’m not stuck raising someone else’s kid). However you need to meet your relationship needs, I’m happy for you. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut, like… if we really click, and we don’t feel like we need anyone else, our relationship issues are surmountable the old-fashioned way, and you’d prefer monogamy? I have no problem committing to that. Higher bar to clear, I guess? Like you should be really confident I’m capable of being the one guy you’ve got.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT’S ON THE WISHLIST\r\n\r\n\r\nRight, you! I’ve been talking mainly about me because that’s the point of this, and because you are an anonymous reader I currently know nothing about, but here are some traits that I find attractive in a partner! If you have a lot of these and want to ask me out, you have good odds!\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Plays games/reads comics/watches anime/etc- we come from the same planet\r\n   * In particular, likes mysteries, comedy, and weird sci-fi- we come from the same town on the same planet\r\n   * Knows me and empirically likes the things I actually produce- we come from the same neighborhood of the same town on the same planet\r\n   * Thinks I am attractive\r\n   * Is a generally happy person- easy to make smile and laugh (my favorite things to do to people)\r\n   * Has a creative hobby of some sort- art or writing or music, a project to cheer on or help with\r\n   * Looking for a long-term relationship involving marriage and kids\r\n   * Smart in the brain\r\n   * Clear communicator, or familiar with ratsphere communication norms- has read “A Human’s Guide to Words”, ideally\r\n   * I’m not too fussed about appearances but know if you have red hair and/or freckles know that you will be rolling with advantage\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that seems good to you, you can contact me at benedictide@gmail.com!"

      "fullText": "﻿Onna Anya\r\nSeeking Meaningful Connections\r\nThat are Beautifully Complex\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Prologue:  the “Why” Behind It All\r\nSometimes, I think we forget how awesome we are--just us--on our own--no excuses or regrets in our unadulterated singularity of quasar magnificence. Recently, I have been thinking about life, about how now I am in my thirties, how life definitely has not turned out the way I thought it would, and how, as odd as it sounds, I am so glad it hasn't. \r\nI also have been thinking about how though I would like to meet my person, and be there for them when they wake up in the morning, having them be there to pull me into a hug which makes me not get up at 5:30 AM every morning.  I have been considering how I would like someone to share my life with, able to fall asleep next to them on the taxi ride home from the subway and know they will wake me up when we get there and for that person to have me to be there for them in a similar-yet-different way based on their own individual desires for a partner’s presence in their life.  However, I also realize that if these things do not ever happen and I never meet such a person, I will be alright with that too.\r\nAs a demisexual, if dating has taught me anything in my limited experience, it is that I would rather be alone, than alone in a relationship. I honestly still do not know what I want, because honestly, I feel it is not about wants, but about being there for people and vice versa.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Pre-Covid Me @ Stowe, Vermont, Von Trapp Brewery)\r\nHave I given up on meeting \"The One?\" The answer is no, I have not. I have occasionally wondered if he is lost in a desert riding a camel backwards in the wrong direction for the time it is taking to have him cross my path--or if I am??!! The other thing I have wondered is if he is lost in the Bermuda Triangle playing with magnets, or maybe if he has found his perfect elsewhere--it could happen, and if it did, more power to him.\r\nSometimes, I wonder if somewhere, \"My Person\" is wondering similarly as they mosey through desserts, play with magnets in the Triangle, or consider if I too have met \"my perfect\" elsewhere, (which I have not, though I have met some \"not–so-perfect\" in this journey, but I digress).\r\nBut I have indeed given up on \"finding love\" being seamless, easy, and clear. Love really is a journey as Ruell sings, and sometimes like Malec in Shadowhunters, you have to go to hell and back twice for the ones you love, and even then, there is no guarantee--only hope, and trust in the ones we love and live for and sometimes who we are lucky enough to live with.\r\nSo, despite things not working out sometimes, despite the unplanned for rude grenades and emotional suicide bombers we may meet on a date,  we can wear Mithril armor, like Frodo, and ward off the Ring Wraiths dressed up as ordinary humanoids. \r\nNowadays, I also spend time just living life, riding motorbikes down roads at night to the swaying of lit Lunar New Year lanterns, feeling the cool air and enjoying the moon above me, going to the beach in the morning to see what it is like when the day is waking on the ocean, and being grateful for the present solitude, whether it remains forever, or is changed in an instant.\r\nIf I ever do meet \"The One,\" how will I know it is him? Well, if a man is riding a camel backwards across the beach one morning I may just go up and ask him why it took him so long to cross the Sahara, but in all seriousness, I think it will be in the surety, in the kindness and care, in the quiet considerations, and in the fact that they like almost everything about me and I feel the same way about them--that they are my version of Puen, and I am their non-nagging equivalent of Talay from the Thai series, Vice Versa, and that it is not about if we can imagine the world without one another, but that we can ONLY imagine it with each other--in every universe. Is that cheesy and pie-in-the-sky? Perhaps, but I will wait for good dairy products and pastries until the cows (or camels as the case may be) come home.\r\nSo at the end of the day, I think the thing that matters is to trust our journeys and to realize that home and the road to it may be different than we expect. It may not be a picket fence yard in suburbia or an apartment in Manhattan. Home may end up being a treehouse in the jungle or a mountain villa in the Himalayas. Our home may be us and our partner with our kids, us alone in our comfy hobbit hole, like Bilbo, it could end up being us and our delightful roomies, or us and the kids the universe gave us in ways we never planned. But no matter how the road is or what home looks like, it is our road and our home, and that is what our heart beats through and to.\r\nIntroduction: \r\n  \r\n\r\nI’m a laid-back, easy-going introvert (ISFJ) and a demisexual/graysexual who values growth, kindness, and quiet humor. I believe life is a gift, and I try to make a positive difference wherever I can — whether for people I love or even strangers who need a hand. My personal motto is: be part of the solution, not the problem. I value doing the right thing, especially when no one is watching.\r\nCareer-wise, I’m a English homeroom teacher and a business college student, currently living in Thailand. During Covid, I discovered how much I love teaching and gradually shifted careers from journalism, convention booking, and disability work to ESL. It was a big pay cut, but the right choice — I’m financially secure and planning to settle permanently in Taiwan in a few years, with both higher income and more free time on the horizon.\r\nI also dabble in creative projects: I’ve built a small YouTube following (300+ subscribers), created podcasts with 20,000+ listens, and published books on Amazon. Writing is part of my life too, and I regularly post essays on Medium.\r\nSpiritually, I was raised with both Christian and Jewish traditions. I celebrate holidays from both and eat somewhat Kosher, though I don’t regularly attend church or synagogue. I don’t mind what beliefs a partner holds, as long as they’re kind and respectful — I wouldn’t want to change someone else’s values, nor do I want mine changed.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Picture taken August 3, 2024)\r\nI’m a sci-fi nerd at heart — Star Trek (Picard, Voyager, and of course Spock) and Stargate Atlantis are my comfort watches. John Shepherd is basically my spirit animal: a witty intergalactic space dad wrangling cranky scientists and adorable aliens.\r\nI’ve also got a soft spot for British dramas like Sherlock, Call the Midwife, and Bleak House. If Brendon Coyle is on screen (North and South, Larkrise to Candleford), I’m there — he just has a way of making every role authentic.\r\nFor fantasy, nothing beats Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, and when I need a laugh, The Big Bang Theory is my go-to. Sheldon is my comedy hero. I also love films about self-discovery, like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which feels like it captures the quintessence of life. ;)\r\nI also enjoy evening motorbike rides, cafe-hopping, and walks by the mountains and the sea.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Staying chill during the pandemic)\r\nWhen I need to relax, I turn to PG-rated BL Asian dramas, like Bad Buddy and Vice Versa. I love how these shows focus on emotional attachment and thoughtful conflict resolution without all the tired gender-war tropes. As a demisexual, I especially relate to characters like Pran and Talay — their journeys mirror a lot of how I experience connection. Plus, these series are just a comforting, feel-good way to unwind at the end of the day.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Tamsui Fishermen’s Wharf–December 2022 Walkabout @ one of my favorite places on earth)\r\nOutside of my nerdier side, I love being outdoors — long walks (1–3 hours) on the beach /mountains, sometimes even in the rain, and exploring the coasts by e-bike or scooter. I also enjoy learning languages (currently Thai, Korean, and Mandarin), and traveling anywhere with a good tea shop along the way. 🙂\r\n👀The Fine Print–LOL👀\r\nI live with some quirks: intermittent hearing loss from a childhood injury, a limited sense of smell, and a tendency to miss sarcasm thanks to being on the autism spectrum. I also don’t drink alcohol. None of these stop me from enjoying life fully — I’m curious, logical, analytical, and probably look younger than my age (36). I appreciate straightforward communication and people who mean what they say. In return, those who know me get to have someone who is thoughtful, steady, and genuinely present in their lives.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(At Driving School Learning how to drive a scooter in Thailand–got my license in February 2024)\r\nI lost both of my parents by the time I was 30 and my younger sibling during the pandemic. Those experiences were very hard, but they’ve also deepened my gratitude for life and the people around me. Over the years, I’ve built a “chosen family” of close friends who mean the world to me, and I carry a very positive outlook into the future.\r\nWhen it comes to family, I’ve always envisioned creating a loving home with children — most likely through adoption, since I want to provide a home for kids who might not otherwise have one. I picture a household with 2–3 children over the next decade or so, and I’m also open to surrogacy if biological children are important to a partner. For me, it’s less about the “how” and more about the joy of raising kids together in a home filled with love, stability, and laughter.\r\nRegarding dating and relationships, I have limited experience because I spent my youth and young adulthood caring for relatives in poor health and helping to raise my younger sibling. Out of my desire to be fully present for my family—and to avoid potentially burdening a partner—I did not consider dating until my early 30s.\r\nAs I've explored the dating world, I’ve found that some men's preferences and priorities don’t always align with my own. Many have expressed a strong desire for biological children while preferring not to be involved in their care. Others have sought casual encounters or wished to marry quickly, while still others weren’t interested in living abroad—all of which don’t resonate with my personal goals and values.\r\nI value independence and self-reliance and strive not to inconvenience others. At the same time, I know that in a healthy relationship, partners can rely on each other. I would appreciate a patient partner who understands that, as trust grows, I will be able to lean on them more, even though I’m capable of handling many things on my own. I hope for a relationship where this balance of independence and support makes life together easier, richer, and more joyful.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Teacherly-Mode–Summer 2023)\r\nI’m looking for a partner who values mutual consideration, care, and camaraderie, and who has a good sense of humor that is kind, not mean. It’s important to me that we like each other “as is,” without trying to change one another, and that our main joy in a relationship comes from being present for each other and sharing life’s simple pleasures—like mountain views, boba tea, or little adventures together. Ideally, I’d like someone who shares my curiosity and drive for personal growth, enjoys exploring the world, and can laugh and have fun along the way.\r\nI believe in building a strong foundation of trust, understanding, and friendship before moving into more serious commitments such as sex, marriage, or living together romantically. Typically, it takes me 6–12 months to feel comfortable exploring these topics. I am open, however, to the idea of living with someone in a more platonic way at first, especially if they are relocating from overseas, as it allows us to spend more time together and deepen our connection while giving emotional intimacy the time it needs to grow.\r\nI prefer a non-smoker, as I am allergic to both cigarette and marijuana smoke. My allergies prevent me from having indoor cats, though I’m open to the idea of an outdoor cat. I also have food allergies to spicy foods, pork, and seafood. While I’m happy for a partner to enjoy their favorite foods, I understand if these restrictions might be a concern—if so, it may be best not to reach out.\r\nAs a demisexual, I believe the strongest relationships are built on care, friendship, and love, and thrive when both people can enjoy the quiet, comfortable moments as well as the laughter and excitement of life together.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Adopting a Serious Face. . .)\r\nMoreover, I am LGBTQI+ friendly and enjoy watching inclusive dramas. It’s important for me to be with someone who is accepting of these aspects of my personality and interests. If you are open-minded and comfortable with these preferences, I would be delighted to hear from you.\r\nI’m not great at flirting, but I show care through thoughtful gestures—like surprising someone with their favorite snacks, taking them to a concert or art show I know they’d enjoy, or suggesting we binge-watch a C-drama on martial arts together. I believe that sharing the commitment of a long series and enjoying the experience together can be a meaningful expression of connection.\r\nCaveats: \r\nI have no preference regarding religious beliefs, ethnicity, or body type in a partner, but I ask that anyone who messages me understand that I will not change my beliefs or body to suit someone else, and I don’t expect them to change for me either—we are who we are. I am currently working on being healthier and losing some weight, but this is for my own personal growth, not to meet someone else’s expectations.\r\nI live in Asia and, while I am open to moving to a different Asian country, I really like Taiwan. I have no plans to move to the USA, Europe, or South America, so I’d appreciate it if potential partners do not assume I will relocate to these regions.\r\nI value a monogamous relationship built on mutual respect, safety, and open communication. I want to be transparent that I am not interested in engaging in kinky activities, oral sex, or any sexual activities that could pose a risk to either partner’s health and safety. Sharing NSFW content is also not something I feel comfortable with, as it does not align with my values. I believe clear communication and honesty are essential in any relationship, and I want potential partners to understand my boundaries upfront. If your relationship goals differ, I wish you the best in finding a partner who is more compatible.\r\nAs previously mentioned, I plan to adopt children in the future. While I would be delighted if a partner wanted to co-parent with me, this is not a requirement or expectation. I am fully prepared to undertake the adoption process and care for the children on my own, both emotionally and financially.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Coming back from an adventure. . . Autumn 2024) \r\nBy sharing this upfront, I hope potential partners feel reassured that there is no pressure or obligation to take on financial or legal responsibilities for my future children. While I would love to have a supportive and involved partner in my family life, I fully respect it if that is not something they are comfortable with or ready for.\r\nTo address potential concerns, I have made arrangements to ensure my family—including any future adopted children—will be cared for in the unlikely event of my passing. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of a partner considering this aspect, but I want to be clear that I do not expect them to take on any legal or caregiving responsibilities.\r\nMy intention in bringing up this topic is not to be blunt or morbid, but to provide transparency and alleviate concerns. If my desire to adopt is a dealbreaker, I kindly ask that such individuals refrain from contacting me, as this is a deeply important part of my life plan.\r\nI consider myself an even-tempered person. On the rare occasions I feel upset, I prefer to step back, calmly identify the specific issues, and communicate them clearly without raising my voice. I welcome respectful discussions and disagreements, but I am strongly opposed to anyone trying to demand something from me. I value respecting others’ autonomy and privacy, and I tend to keep disagreements private unless directly relevant or asked about.\r\nWhile I am generally easy-going and accommodating, I hold firm to my autonomy. Some people are surprised when they encounter this, as it may seem out of character, but I believe respecting each other’s autonomy is crucial in any relationship. I expect the same consideration I extend to others.\r\nI understand that not everyone shares this view, and I respect their right to live as they choose. At the same time, I believe a healthy relationship requires mutual respect, including allowing space for each other’s beliefs and opinions. That said, I am open to changing my mind if presented with a well-reasoned, patient, and respectful argument.\r\nDespite what these caveats may imply, I am a calm, relaxed person. My goal in sharing these boundaries is not to intimidate, but to save both myself and potential partners time and confusion, and to lay a foundation for honest, mutually respectful connections.\r\nEnding Thoughts and Contact Information:\r\nThank you for reading this far! Please feel free to email me if you’re interested in exploring a possible relationship, or even if you simply think we might make good friends.\r\nEither way, I truly appreciate your time and consideration, and I wish you the very best on your journey.\r\nEmail:  rosesoutofthesnow@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿About me\r\n\r\n\r\n* 38 years old\r\n\r\n\r\n* 5’8” (Don’t care about your height; I’ve dated women who are taller than me barefoot and I’m not bothered by it. Obviously, it’s okay if you have a preference.) \r\n\r\n\r\n* Based in NYC (Currently on sabbatical in Argentina and working on some personal goals.)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Agnostic/Spiritual \r\nSpirituality in the sense of my understanding of the world through what I know from science, experience, reflection, etc. Belief systems are also connected to language.\r\n\r\n* Divorced; no kids\r\nThe divorce was in 2017. The marriage was practical and beneficial to both of us. But we were also in love - so not just a practical arrangement either. \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Don’t smoke (prefer that you don't, or you're trying to quit). Rarely drink (don’t mind if you do).\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I spend my time\r\n\r\n\r\nFor work (as defined in the conventional sense), I do machine learning in tech.\r\n\r\nMy background is actually in applied math, which I love. I enjoy using my quantitative skills at work. But I value things outside of work a lot, in terms of how I interact with and contribute to society.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really value expression in life, whether it’s through the written word or through movement. Some of my interests:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Dance: It’s been a non-trivial part of my life for at least a decade now. I’ve always been moved by music (although I didn’t have the chance to learn music/dance formally growing up). And being able to express music is what I love the most about dance.\r\n\r\n   * Movement practice like yoga, fitness classes and aerial hoop (this is my latest obsession as of a year ago - I always try to have some things that are hard for me to keep me humble and motivated to grow, and some things where I can feel good about myself).\r\n\r\n   * Written words: I love to read (when I can these days) and write creatively. Within fiction, I love any flavor of existentialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n      * Tennis. Really any racquet sport: ping pong, badminton, pickleball (I gave in)\r\n\r\n      * Cooking: I cook for myself and love what I make for myself more than any restaurant food.\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Travel: I’ve traveled a lot, both solo and with partners. There’s a wide variety of things that interest me: foreign cultures, nature, road trips.\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Volunteering: a bunch of different things from children’s health and education to homelessness and food security. \r\nRelationship stuff\r\nThings I value\r\n(both in others and about myself)\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Empathy: I just want to be around people who care about others. I’m empathetic and it’s so easy for me to care about my partner in long term relationships. It’s nice when we can look out for each other in our own ways and our strengths can be complementary. Two people thinking for both!\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Authenticity/sincerity: I just like being myself and I appreciate people who can just share time with me and maybe we see through each other a bit during the time we interact. It’s what I enjoy in any kind of connection, even non-romantic ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Open-minded: I mean in the sense of questioning your own assumptions about life. I’m curious about the deep stuff in life and am very aware that all of my beliefs are also connected to my personal experience and that a new experience or a new rational argument has the potential to change that belief. I may have a high confidence about some of my beliefs based on what I’ve experienced, but I’m always open to learning a different perspective even it that doesn’t make sense to me at that time.\r\n\r\n         * Communication: I think it really goes both ways. This is the mental model that I want to keep in mind for myself:\r\n            * As a speaker, I try to express my needs trying my best not to hurt my partner.\r\n            * As a listener, I have to be ready to hear the hard stuff without taking it as a judgement about myself.\r\nBoth are hard and I know I’ll fail a lot. But it’s a kindness practice the same way I work on exercising my body. In the end, everything is negotiable.\r\nDating style\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we decide we might be a match, I'd prefer to do a brief video chat or a quick coffee date sooner rather than messaging back and forth. I'm sure you're great, but until I know you, I like to prioritize my little free time for my hobbies and with my real life communities. I’m happy to answer anything specific that’s missing here before we connect further.\r\nRelationship style\r\n            * I prefer monogamy, but as I said about anything within a relationship, this also falls under something that’s negotiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n            * Sex is an important part of the relationship but all the values I think are important for a relationship as a whole are the important aspects here as well: Communicating needs, trying to listen without judgement, etc. GGG as the kids say.\r\n\r\n            * Intimacy: Physical touch, showing affection with touch and spending time together with non-sexual intimacy are also very important to me. I don’t need all of these to be important to you as well, but if it’s difficult for you to express through touch, I’d miss that non-verbal communication.\r\nKids\r\n               * I don’t have any kids yet. \r\n               * I love kids and I’m good with kids. (I have volunteered, and still do, in programs with kids and also with kids/adults on the spectrum.)\r\n               * I’m open to having kids.\r\n               1. If my partner is sure about not wanting kids, it’d be far easier for me to choose that option.\r\n               2. I think planning to have kids is a promise to the life that you decide to bring into the world. I think it’s a responsibility that you decide to take on as a couple very consciously when the relationship is in that place.\r\nHow to reach me?\r\nWrite to me \r\n               * if you think we might be a good match, or\r\n               * if something about my profile resonated with you and you’d like to talk about it even if you don’t think we’re a good match.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail: karthikeyan.rajendran@gmail.com\r\nText: 609 613 2710"

      "fullText": "﻿Updated November 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nHello everyone!\r\n\r\n\r\nI imagine you are here because you really want to find your person. If you want to check to see if you are physically attracted to me, before you read my essay, scroll past the words and you shall find a lot of recent photos. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo much of what I have realized on this long journey to finding my person, is that perhaps I am not meant to have “my person”. Maybe this path is not meant for me. I feel more of a sense of peace about this now, versus a year ago, when I was doing a significant amount of grieving regarding being very single and childless, despite my best efforts to create that life for myself. \r\n\r\n\r\nThough I have surrendered to not forcing the river, so to speak, I have not resigned myself to perpetual spinsterhood, though it is actually a great life like this. I am still willing to show myself the best I can, and see if anyone out there resonates. I am learning and growing around how to be even more courageous in the process of doing this, and how to more effectively show you who I am. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth process and the chance I may actually connect with someone who seems to be similar to me, keep me on this platform, despite not having much luck with it, since I joined in March 2024. \r\n\r\n\r\n….\r\n\r\n\r\nI will start by saying depth, authenticity, freedom, detail, precision, and embodiment are very important to me. If they are not important to you, this may be a way we are already mismatched. You may find me kind of off-putting or annoying if you want a one-page sheet that sums up who I am and what I want. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am not ever going to be a one-pager type of woman. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would love it if you also related to life in this way. I want to know you seek a level of depth, thoroughness, and integrity in understanding yourself and how to express and embody who you are in the world, to the degree that I do, or more! \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a flawed human, with my own insecurities, just like we all are. I have ways I keep failing at certain goals. I am a work in progress. I am very aware of the work, every day. I have learned to have more fun with it all, in the past several years. I suppose I have been accused of being an over-thinker or a person who is too serious. I do reflect and consider many realities, throughout each day. I can also be very serious. But, I am also a playful, silly, fun person, too. I just don’t tend to immediately come off that way, in certain contexts. My conscientiousness or thoughtfulness can be written off as tedious, when I am just trying to show care and love for others. \r\n\r\n\r\nI do tend to be most playful when I am around people I feel comfortable with. I also tend to shine brightest, when I am working, out in nature, being spontaneous, dancing, enjoying a sensual sexual experience, eating my favorite foods, surfing, doing pole, on adventures, and traveling. I shine the brightest during solo travel, though I want to travel with a partner. I long for this.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a really complex person. I think I could spend a whole lifetime revealing who I am to someone. I put great effort into sharing who I am and want to be seen. I also expect the person wants to know all these parts of me, just the way I want to know all of them. I deeply desire to have the type of relationship where we delight in learning more and more about each other, and rest into a deeper and deeper knowing of the other’s spirit. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou will find in me a deeply loyal and committed partner. Someone who wants to take the time to understand and connect with you. I will always push myself to overcome fear and shame, in order to not hide or protect myself, with you. I just need to see you are a safe person to do this with. I want to be met in this way by another. Let’s create a level of safety with each other that we have never encountered, anywhere, through mutually delving deep within and choosing to be accountable, self-loving, and available to each other, every day. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am also an extremely generous person. I want to give the people I love (friends and partners) everything I can. I am big on making and giving gifts. I am big on doting on people. I love creating an atmosphere of abundance together with people. I want us to be so open and fluid in our generosity with each other, that we love treating one another to things. I want to create that sort of atmosphere, where we treat each other like royalty. I want to have you know how deeply special and valued you are to me, just like I deeply long for being treated this way by you. I don’t remain connected to people anymore, who do not have this same aim in their close relationships. I want you to be my treasure, and I want to be your treasure, too. \r\n\r\n\r\nI would love us to create a life together based around travel and living in a way we choose. I don’t want us to settle in life. I want us to both be clear of what we want, and aim for that. I want us to support each other in developing our individual paths to the highest degree, and to live a fulfilling, authentic life. This may mean doing homeschool for our kids, or living in a very unique way together. This may mean developing an open relationship. This may mean eventually being Poly. This may mean us having periods of time where we are traveling without each other or living separately. I have a lot of flexibility in terms of how we can live our best lives that deeply honor who we are as individuals, all held within the love, trust, safety, and commitment we have with each other. I want a strong enough “WE”, so we can also keep supporting full freedom of the “I”, and vice versa. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a dreamer, but I am also a pragmatist. Naturally, everything I envision with a life partner, is something I have built towards cultivating with them. As I am already living this way, myself. \r\n\r\n\r\nI realized at a pretty early age that if I didn’t get right with myself, I would not be very happy or successful in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I use every opportunity I can to grow and transform. I have done a ton of work on myself (and continue to do so) in order to be the most free, courageous, accountantable, autonomous and capable human I can be. \r\n\r\n\r\nI live nomadically. I have created a job where I have the freedom and the amount of time to travel and play around the world. I am working on becoming even more free and rich in time and resources. I am working on living my life only doing what I want to do, when I want to do it. It has required a lot of planning and failure, but I am getting there, more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also living a life where I am doing the exact work I want to be doing. It feels deeply meaningful, and is very rewarding. So, I get the honor of having my work be a naturally authentic expression of who I am and how I want to be in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have also done a lot of healing work on myself. I have gone to trauma therapy, learned all about and healed a ton of my trauma (still working on it), and I deeply understand my strengths and weaknesses. I have become an exquisite communicator precisely because of all the healing work I have done, and the opportunities I take to practice showing up better as a human, every day. My heart is open, most of the time, and when it is not, I do my best to understand why, to share openly about this, and to overcome my fear and shame. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have created a community of people around the world where we have a supportive relationship, who see me and know me deeply, who are not scared to call me out and help me see my blind spots. I do the same for them! This is exactly how I want it! \r\n\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a larger goal of moving to Italy. I will likely move there in April or May 2025. I do not plan to move back to the US. I am from Hawaii originally, and lived in Colorado and Northern California for a while, before moving to Mexico in 2017. I have been using Mexico as my home base ever since. Soon, Italy will be my home base as I travel around and explore more of this amazing planet. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith or without you, my life will be great. I would prefer to do it with you. I would love to embark on the adventure of life partnership and family, done in a creative and unique way, that preserves and expresses the wildness in us.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you interested? Have you built a life that involves this level of courage, adventure, accountability, authenticity, growth, joy, and creativity? If so, reach out to me. I would love to connect with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out via email: \r\n\r\n\r\napommerenk@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿WELCOME TO MY DATE DOC!\r\nI made this mostly for fun and to meet new people, but if I happen to meet the right girl, I promise I will work to make you feel loved, appreciated, and happy. After all, isn't that what life is about?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try to update this document with any potential changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nStats: \r\nName: Kyron\r\n\r\n\r\nAge: 24\r\n\r\n\r\nEthnicity: Black/African-American\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages: English (fluent), Spanish (very beginner but I REALLY want to learn)\r\n\r\n\r\nHeight: 5’4\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality: Somewhat shy, but Also somewhat confident. Smart, sarcastic, but caring and kind. Introvert.\r\n\r\n\r\nBio:\r\nHi! My name is Kyron! I'm currently in Chicago. I'm working on becoming a Software developer/web developer right now and becoming more stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a college graduate with a degree in Game Design (what a useful degree, I know). I have a fair amount of skills/hobbies: drawing, coding, skateboarding, and gaming to name a few.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm generally pretty kind, thoughtful and some consider me funny, but some are probably wrong. I try my hardest to be very caring, but I'm also introverted and can occasionally slow down a bit due to low social battery. Hopefully anyone that would be interested can understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For:\r\nI'm searching for a 21 - 25yo female (Cis), with an open mind and a kind heart! I'm quite left-leaning politically, so I'd want a girl to be the same, although I'm open to different perspectives, to a point. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am dating with intention, but I also prefer a slower style of relationship building so I can see if things can really work out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLikes: \r\n* Skateboarding, drawing, coding, deep or political talks, cuddling, occasional silence, exploring, fun small dates (boba, coffee, libraries, bookstores, museums), music, video games, manga/anime (trying to get back into these)\r\n\r\n\r\nDislikes: \r\n* Overly loud people (occasionally this is fun, especially for a joke), unrealistic expectations, unclarity of intentions, hyper-aggression, bigotry, overly traditional roles, extremely large parties or clubs\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers (Absolutely Must NOT Have):\r\n* Super religious, sorry.\r\n* Right-leaning, or believe in racism, genocide, sexism, homophobia, Ect.\r\n* Smoker of any kind or Heavy drinker.\r\n* Aggressive, particularly enjoys fighting or arguing.\r\n* Unreasonability/No communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreferences (Nice to have, but not necessary):\r\n* Belief in communication to solve problems.\r\n* College education of some kind\r\n* Culture different to mine (I really like learning about other cultures/people)\r\n* Knowing multiple languages\r\n* Likes cuddling/physical affection\r\n* Thinner-medium body types (No shame to bigger girls!)\r\n* Somewhat athletic\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\nI generally go with the flow of life, but I do aim to work hard at being a software developer, preferably for video games. Things may be uncertain in the near future, but hopefully you will encourage me through it!\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things that may be important to you:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am all about transparency. So I will share some things about me that may be of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I have an ex that I am still good friends with. I don't have any romantic feelings towards them anymore, something broke in me after we broke up and I just couldn't go back.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I do like sex, but I don’t think this should be the basis of a relationship, merely an element of it. That said, if you're into something you feel is embarrassing or strange such as kinks or fetishes, please share it with me! I'm very open in this regard and not judgemental!\r\n\r\n\r\n* I do not like pressuring others into doing things. Please be upfront to me about what you want and what you don't. I want to have a functional and supportive relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Kids. I'm not sure if I want kids just yet… But… I am open to the idea. The main issue is that I want to be able to provide for a family. I don't think it's right to bring a kid here, just to have it struggle. Ultimately, if you really want kids, I'll probably give them to you, just don't make this decision carelessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I've stated I'm introverted before. I think I should say that if I happen to randomly check out or dissociate, it's not me ignoring you, but rather I'm probably just a lil tired.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord: kyron54 - primary messaging \r\nEmail: bluekeshon79@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\nPictures!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have longer hair now!"

I always think a lot before I say something… pursue one thing… Someone who says what’s on their mind, like play, litefooted, jumps from one thing to another.”\n“She’ll be a muse for your prophet. Like symbiosis in nature. The tree, strong and unbending, and the moss, growing inside, forcing it to adapt. There are symbiotic and asymbiotic relationships. The muse generates the ideas, the prophet has the patience to write them down. Just don’t let the muse – different, fascinating – take away all your energy. Is your partner dominant or submissive?”\n“Dominant, but not in the sense of controlling.

Someone who wants to co-create a beautiful partnership where we can support and inspire each other in our missions to create a better world while overcoming life’s inevitable challenges, building relationships/communities, and enjoying life.\nAge: Born 1992\nKids: 65% yes but 95% that I won’t get kids in the next two years (until end of 2026).\nGender/Sexuality: Straight man.\nRelationship structure: Monogamish.\nLocation:\nLondon: ~ 6 months/year until at least mid-2026.\nUS/Bay area: ~2 months/year.\nAnywhere in the world (but preference for strategically relevant places): ~4 months/year\nKindly don’t share this publicly!\nTable of content\nAbout me\nMy journey\nMy decade vision\nFacts\nAbout you\nQualities and tendencies\nImportant stuff\nFacts and nice-to stuff\nAbout us\nNext steps\nAppendix\nBig-5 personality\nAbout me\nMe with some of my friends in London. (2023)\nALT\nI’m a co-founder of Impact Academy - a non-profit that runs ambitious educational programs to enable young people to use their careers to solve some of the most pressing problems and contribute to a better future. I also work as a coach for impact-driven people. I enjoy communal living and have lived in multiple group houses -  including one with a six-month-old baby, but am also open to other forms of communal living.\nBefore that, I did a bunch of different things throughout my life. I trained as a medical doctor, did biosecurity research at Stanford that might have contributed a tiny bit to the prevention of pandemics, co-founded Effective Altruism Denmark, co-authored a book during my undergrad, and created a course for 1000+ students.\nI’m also a mediocre salsa dancer and a non-terrible singer (who loves to sing Alicia Keys songs). On the more adventurous side, I've spent four months in Nepal and hitchhiked from Copenhagen to Budapest.\nMy journey\nDue to luck and a great teacher, I had a wake-up call when I was 16 and I realized that I was on a bad trajectory. I started to work on forming my values, character, and lifestyle to take care of myself and lead a more meaningful and altruistic life (such as supporting refugees). As I was deciding on my degree, I considered many different options (from social science to philosophy) as I’m very curious (and still am! 🙂). However, I narrowed it down to medicine and psychology and eventually decided on medicine as I thought it was the most promising way of understanding the human condition and thus help others the most. Especially those who needed it the most. This was mainly driven by altruism, curiosity, and unnoticed guilt.\nDuring the first years of my undergrad, I co-authored a book with a Norwegian author who had inspired me when I was younger. The book we wrote together was on how to study effectively and I was later hired to create and teach a course for all medical students at my university. I eventually decided to pivot away from this because I believed effective altruism and global health were more important (not an easy decision!). I had several existential crises and almost dropped out to join Effective Giving when it was starting out. However, I decided to finish the degree and build the EA community in Denmark (which I did for three years next to med school). During these later years, I also started finding “my people,” with whom I built deep friendships that last to this day, frequently bringing me joy and gratitude.\nTowards the end of med school, I ran a career experiment in biosecurity at Stanford University, SSI, and the US CDC for two years. My research was on mortality monitoring using EuroMOMO because I predicted it’d be useful in pandemics (pre-covid). This included living in an incredible group house with entrepreneurs in Palo Alto and trying coaching. These experiences introduced me more seriously to entrepreneurship and coaching - both of which I’ve been pursuing since 2020. In 2022, I had the fortune of meeting some awesome and like-minded people who had a similar vision so we co-founded Impact Academy.\nMe facilitating a workshop at a conference. (2019)\nALT\nMy decade vision\nI have three main ambitions for this decade (until December 31st, 2030):\nMake Impact Academy a world-class organization that runs ambitious educational programs to enable people to use their careers to solve some of the most pressing problems and contribute to a better future.\nFind the other half of an altruistic couple - a \"romantic co-founder\". Someone who wants to co-create a beautiful relationship where we can support each other in our missions to create a better world, grow, and create beautiful experiences. This could involve starting a family.\nBe a coach for some of the most impactful individuals and enable them to enhance their lifetime impact, become their best selves, and care for themselves and their loved ones.\nFacts\nHeight:\n183 cm\nAge:\n31 (1992)\nKids:\n65% yes: I’ll give it 65% that I will get kids at some point and 95% that I won’t get kids in the next two years (until 2026). Since I was 18, I’ve felt that the world is my family and haven’t had a need or drive to have my own kids. For several years, I wanted to adopt, but now I think that isn’t the best way to improve the world. Recently, that shifted for me and if I find a partner, I’m open to it (but not in the next two years) if it doesn’t significantly detract from our ability to serve the world.\nGender/Sexuality:\nStraight: I identify as a man, and I’m attracted to women.\nRelationship structure:\nMonogamish: Historically, I’ve found it difficult to find enough time for one partner and don’t have a need for multiple partners. I’m open to my partner seeing others if that makes her happy.\nLocation:\nOxford/London until at least mid-2026: 10-30% remote work is possible for that period. Open to moving after that (e.g., to the US) but I hope to set up a base (including a group house) with a partner in London.\nReligion/spirituality:\nAgnostic/atheist: I’m deeply grateful for the scientific method and the Scout Mindset. You might be somewhat religious or spiritual, but you’re more likely to identify as Atheist or Agnostic. That said, I have some sense of spirituality and have benefitted from some aspects of religion (especially secular Buddhism), and I hope you have too.\nMe at a salsa camp - almost feels like a different life now (2019).\nALT\nLinks\nHere are some of the books I’ve read throughout my life Goodreads (only a small subset of the books).\nHere’s my website.\nMe finishing a Spartan race with one of my best friends, Paul. (2021)\nALT\nAbout you\nBelow is my current hypothesis for what I’m looking for in a partner. If most of this resonates, then we might be a great match, though (in all honesty) you may be too good for me. 😊 Don’t worry about “ticking all of the boxes” - the most important thing is that most of these resonate with you. I’d much rather that you err in favor of reaching out (you’re probably awesome) than think that you “don’t tick enough boxes”.\nQualities and tendencies\nImportant stuff\nWe will likely be a good match if most of the following qualities are important to you.\nEthical and on an ambitious mission to make the world better.\nYou have a drive to make the world a better place and have used this as your guiding star during most of your important life decisions. You have engaged with several moral theories, and you likely find some form of consequentialism the most plausible, though you appreciate other theories. You might be particularly devoted to the betterment of future generations or think that the alleviation of suffering is more important than the promotion of happiness. You’ve probably been inspired by Effective Altruism (though may have significant reservations), but you’re at least positive about the core principles of wanting to improve the world and using reason and evidence.\nIntellectual and curious.\nYou find great joy in understanding things by using a scientific mindset. Holding accurate beliefs is much more important than being right to you. You’ve changed your mind on important issues, which led to you taking action, too. Even though it was weird or unconventional. You enjoy trying new things, are likely an avid reader, and find long (3 hours+) conversations enjoyable.\nGrowth-oriented and perhaps even a bit wise.\nGrowing as a person and becoming wiser is important to you. For many years, you’ve probably done things such as i) reflecting on your values, strengths, and weaknesses, ii) trying to optimize/systematize your life, and iii) cultivating virtues such as humility and kindness. You may have read books like Man’s Search For Meaning, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, and Peak and have habits like meditation, journaling, and tracking. You probably also love facilitating this for others.\nGlobally-minded (Cosmopolitan)\nYou’re globally minded and care about global affairs - from the more substantive and difficult to the lighthearted. For example, you’ll happily engage in a discussion on the relationship between the US and China and appreciate cultivating friendships with people from different cultures.\nLoving and affectionate yet strong and emotionally stable\nYou’re caring and attentive to the needs of others. You’d sense whether I’m happy or sad and make me feel cared for via your words and actions (and emojis ☺️). Bonus points if one of your love languages is physical touch. That being said, you have a fairly deep sense of who you are and some level of self-compassion. Consequently, you don’t let others’ perspectives and needs crowd out yours so you can set boundaries and express disagreements when you think it’s right.\nProfessionally, you’re likely to have tried many different things that involved bringing out the best in people and were deeply guided by the things above. You’re passionate and (at least mildly) obsessive about what you do. Perhaps you are (or have been):\nA social entrepreneur\nCoach\nEducator\nBuilder of communities.\nKids: You’re not in a hurry to get kids (definitely not before 2026).\nFacts and nice-to stuff\nPerhaps some of the following hold true for you, too.\nAge:\nIdeal: 25-35. Acceptable: 22-40\nHeight:\nIdeal: 163-180 cm. 160-185 cm.\nDiet:\nVegetarian/vegan unless you have good arguments not to be.\nOther things that are less important\nAbout us\nAt the highest level, I want us to co-create a beautiful partnership where we can support and inspire each other in our missions to create a better world while learning, building relationships/communities, and enjoying life. This will require experimentation, work, and direct communication.\nBased on my previous relationships, I’d love to do some of these things together:\n💓 Supporting each other through the most important ups and downs in life. Be it celebrating big and small wins or holding compassionate space for each other's imperfections.\n🖥️ Co-working. I expect both of us to be at least moderately obsessed with what we do, which makes co-working very valuable and deeply meaningful - this also works remotely.\n🫂 Getting to know each other deeply and creating a “shared language”. From having long conversations about the books we’ve enjoyed the most and what we’re doing professionally to coming up with cute idiosyncratic words and knowing each other’s journeys intimately.\n📕 Co-reading a book. I really enjoy sitting closely while reading a book. This also works remotely. Perhaps we’ll co-author a book one day.\n🤗 Cuddling and being close when we’re together (perhaps one of your love languages is physical touch).\n🎤 Singing songs (as mentioned, I’m a sucker for Alicia Keys but very happy to sing other songs) and improvised dancing 💃🏽.\n📝 Writing blog posts together, learning about important concepts or skills (I’m upskilling on AI these days), or co-hosting events such as intentional reading, lighting talks, yearly goal-setting, or world-building.\nThis is a picture from an intentional reading event I co-hosted. (2023)\nALT\nPast relationships\nI’m grateful for the previous romantic relationships I’ve been part of, and I think all of them are wonderful people. However, they didn’t work for some important reasons, and it’s valuable to learn from them. Here are some reasons why it didn’t work (work in progress).\nWhat I felt was missing (in some or all of the relationships):\nNot enough altruism and/or dedication.\nFelt I was the one who was taking the initiative and helping us grow\nNot being into intense intellectual conversations.\nWhat they felt was off (across some or all previous partners):\nI worked too much, didn’t prioritize them enough, and tended to talk too much about our work instead of their feelings.\nFelt I had too high expectations of them, which caused some anxiety.\nThem not liking long distance and/or us moving for professional reasons. I don’t love long-distance, but I can be happy while being apart if the initial base is there.\nNext steps\nIf this resonates deeply with you, please reach out to me on email (sebastian@sebastianschmidt.world). I appreciate directness! 😊\nAppendix\nBig-5 personality\nOpenness: 90%\nConscientiousness: 93%\nExtraversion: 75%\nAgreeableness: 80%\nNeuroticism: 20%"

My parents were older when they met, married, and had kids, and in many ways they were more relaxed about parenting. Both of my parents are actively religious (Catholic), and generosity and service were key pillars of my upbringing. I have a large extended family, and I am intentional about remaining connected to my family, and especially being a supportive aunt/cousin/friend to the younger kids. \r\n      * Social – Being a good friend is very important and I like to interact with friends throughout my day. If I am not going into the office, I will often go to a friend’s apartment to cowork or invite a friend over to cowork from my apartment.\r\n      * Spiritual – I grew up in a very Catholic household. I still enjoy going to Mass on occasion, though the ritual is more important to me than the spirituality. I appreciate Catholic Social Tradition and am comfortable with people practicing or retaining different cultural religious practices. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tSeptember 2023 – work group at conference \r\n\tSeptember 2023 – Sound of Music sing a long at the Hollywood Bowl\r\n\tSeptember 2023 – Beyonce \r\n\tWhat I’m Looking For\r\n* I want someone who cares about the work he does for the world, and views his job as additive to society, but I don’t want to be with someone who spends all his free time strictly on work. \r\n* I love being with people, and would be skeptical or reluctant to spend a lot of time with someone who does not seem to need or want close friendships. I don’t want to become your sole source of activity and socialization (it’s happened for me in the past). \r\n* Your job should be important to you and provide some level of passion and purpose. If you work all the time to the point that it does not allow you time for activities or friends, or really impacts your mental health, we may not be a good match. \r\n* Lifestyle\r\n   * Weekly activities – I hope you enjoy meeting up with people and trying new activities!\r\n   * Travel – are you open to both domestic and international trips? Do you like trying new food or exploring museums?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tApril 2023 – salsa night \r\n\tFebruary 2023 – girls weekend in North Carolina\r\n\tFebruary 2023 – Malibu hike\r\n\t\r\n\r\n* Kids/Family\r\n   * All types of relationships (platonic, family, work, etc.) matter to me and your family (chosen included) will matter to me.\r\n   * I love being with kids. That being said, I do not want to undergo fertility testing or IVF. I’ve seen too many family members and friends suffer (emotionally and financially) and I know that there are too many kids in need of homes. I am happy being a stepmother or I am happy adopting or fostering if we cannot have our own.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tAugust 2023 – birthday picnic\r\n\tAugust 2023 – family reunion\r\n\tJuly 2023 – bocce season\r\n\tLike what you see/read?

I immigrated from Haiti in 2018. I have lived and went to college in New York and have been living in the South Bay for over 2 years. I am a sister, a cousin, a godmother, and a friend to many. I value family and friendships a lot and a continuous goal of mine is to maintain and nurture these relationships. I consider myself an introvert but can be outgoing in the right settings and with the right people.\nHobbies\nI like cooking and love trying new recipes, at least every month. They don’t always turn out how I want to but it’s always a good time and a fun experience (see my failed attempt at baking croissants and eclairs below)\nI lived on island for most of my life so I love the beach and feeling the warm sand in between my toes. I am also a sucker for a beautiful sunset and will always stop to admire and snap a few pictures (see below).\nI have tried many sports such as basketball, tennis, boxing, swimming, muay thai, and kickboxing. I’m currently doing the latter. My mantra is to try some things at least once. This applies to sports and other aspects of my life.\nWork, Volunteering\nI am software engineer now (I studied CS and Accounting) and I have dreams/goals to venture into other careers that are fulfilling and meaningful to me.\nI have mostly volunteered within the tech industry either as a mentor or a website developer for non-profit organizations in the Bay Area.\n💃🏾Things that excite me:\nFinding the solution to an implementation\nBoard Games (social deception are my favorites)\nVolunteering\nSpending time with loved ones\nTraveling\nFostering and Mentoring\nThings that make me laugh:\nBad jokes\nPuns\nDad jokes\nA bit of vulnerability here:\nHonestly this Date Me Doc alone is a huge step out of my comfort zone. If we were to meet on a dating app or out in the wild, I wouldn’t be the type to talk a lot so sharing this much is already a a huge step. Writing this was hard because I don’t think I have ever thought about myself to that extent. BUT writing this has also been nice. I love the person I am and am becoming.\n💘 Love compatibility\nMarriage is ultimately the end goal and would love to have children, with the right person.\nI show love through words of affirmation and act of service. I can be an overthinker so reassurance is greatly appreciated.\nIdeally, you are 26-42, with no children, but want some day. You, share some of my values, can be vulnerable, kind to others, caring, curious and open minded, enjoy deep talk, fun and playful to be around. You have goals and are actively working on them. You’ve seen or are seeing a therapist. You are aware of things that needs to be worked on. You get my weird humor.\n🚫 Non Negotiables\nNon LGBTQ+ Ally\nRacist\nConforms to patriarchal views of women in the workforce/home\nPromised Pictures:\nBeautiful sunset from SF (photo refuses to stay upright :’)\nALT\nFailed attempt at baking croissants (1)\nALT\nFailed attempt at baking croissants (2)\nALT\n☺️ Interested?\nIf this resonates with you at all or know a friend, contact me at neissa@dorsinville.com"

      "fullText": "﻿Blake, 28, feral, looking for a new home\r\nI’m running a two for one deal, this is my cat Gibbs, he goes where I go.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA little bit about me\r\nLife goes between jam packed and absolutely nothing, just the way i like it. I'm usually getting up to something most weekends like hiking, road tripping, or catching my brother's concerts. During the weekdays I like to read in peace, paint, or just chew through a video game. If I'm not planning anything, my friends up in frisco are doing something wild while I visit - ask me about the “anything but clothes” party :P\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling is one of my loves. Last year I spent two weeks in New Orleans and then drove up the coast of Maine to visit Bangor, the city that inspired Stephen King’s IT. Language is one of the things that motivates my travels. I love hearing local slang, mannerisms, and the cadences people have when they interact with me. I was on a Bayou boat in Louisiana once, we were trudging along a gator filled strip of water called the “Dead River” and the captain told us we needed to be careful traveling through here because roots will “Bunny ear” (dent) the rotor. It’s so small but I love finding words that don’t leave a hundred mile radius.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorror stories are a passion of mine, I love the themes, the visuals, the often goofy nature of it. Who doesn’t love getting a little tingle on their spine every now and again ;) it teaches us how to appreciate the happy stuff. It’s meditative for me, by looking at the fears in my core I can learn a little bit about myself. Why am i scared, how does that bleed into my day to day life, who else feels this way, and of course, how do I turn that into something I can express - giving me a deeper connection to those around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nStories like Berserk have always resonated with me. It’s a manga about trauma, violence, loss, awful shit - but it’s also about healing and how the connections we make help get us through life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nI’m very passionate about my career in art - filmmaking, painting, sculpture, and the occasional bad poetry. Because of this my identity and career are pretty intertwined.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy day job is as a video producer for a film/TV microphone company. I generate the photo/video marketing and even some educational videos about the film audio industry. Been working there for a few years and it’s honestly been wonderful. Directing, editing, gaffing, camera, you name it and I can’t get enough of it. I’m happy to be using the skills i’ve trained so long for, that’s not something every filmmaker in this city gets to say - I'm fortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the quiet hours of the night I work on my second career which is making miniature painting videos. It’s still in its infancy but it recently started integrating brand deals and the future is looking awesome. My goal is to document the journey and all the highs and lows it includes, hopefully people can see it and stay inspired in their own painting journey. I’ve gotten some really touching messages and it seems to be resonating with people :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUS, I stare at so many monitors at my job so having another project that’s analog is a good way to unwind but still practice something.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe benefit OR embarrassing part of being a content creator is that you can check out all this stuff before hand…I have heard my voice is quite nice so there's that ;P\r\n\r\n\r\nDating\r\nA serious relationship is the goal! I’m monogamous and only really want to date monogamous. Of course, if you’re hunting for something in particular that I can’t give then i’m open to communication and support! Like, we're at a party and you wanna make out with someone, it's whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve been in two long term relationships that left a lot to be desired. In the past i was too passive about what did and did not bother me. Since then i’ve learned stuff doesn’t change unless you vocalize it, so expect good communication from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, I want to date someone who has a good relationship with themselves and their goals. Passion for life, communication, and kindness are the most attractive traits in my book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you and hearing about your life!\r\n\r\n\r\nInsta @mr_flannel__"

If you resonate with what you read, let’s chat or meet up! psaniko@gmail.com or @akimbow on Telegram. If you know someone who you think might be a fit, feel free to send them this doc.\r\n  \r\n\r\nBasics\r\nMan, straight\r\nMonogamous\r\n32 years old (1992)\r\nBerlin, flexible\r\nGerman and English\r\n190cm tall\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies & Interests\r\nEnergy: I’d consider myself ambivert, i.e. I enjoy meeting new people and doing activities in large groups but also need a lot of down time (which can be with close friends). I had periods where I filled my week with salsa, bachata, acrobatics, HIIT, and scuba - and apnoe diving but also ones where I tinkered with a rocket layout for a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouch: I greatly enjoy cuddling and massages (recently did 100h of learning Thai massage and am loving it). Physical touch is my primary love language by a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nSports: I love being active and pushing my body. The past 7 years I’ve enjoyed Crossfit and olympic weightlifting a lot. With friends I sometimes do AcroYoga or go hiking.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharity: I discovered Effective Altruism 11 years ago and it’s become a big part of my life. Most of my friends consider themselves EAs and I enjoy engaging in big questions about our future. It has shaped my career and worldview and while working in IT and finance I was lucky to be able to donate large parts of my salary to charities and causes I believe in.\r\n\r\n\r\nVeggie: I’ve been vegan for 10 years. I rarely make veggie exceptions but eating meat is a non-negotiable for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks: Super into sci-fi and fantasy epics (Brandon Sanderson, Pierce Brown, Andy Weir, etc). I also enjoy non-fiction books about history, psychology, economics, and the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames: I almost exclusively play co-op games with friends. Something about strategizing and adventuring with friends in vast worlds is super satisfying to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\nI’m looking for the classic partner in crime. I’m done with short term dating around and would like to build a long lasting relationship. I want to live out my cheesy, romantic side while at the same time knowing I can rely on my partner in whatever life throws at us.\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle: For me that means a monogamous relationship but I’m not strictly opposed to opening it up if that’s what we both want. \r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: I currently live in Berlin but I’m flexible w.r.t. moving in the future. I’ve lived in Hong Kong and the Bay Area before.\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I want kids and it’s a deal breaker if you can’t imagine this in your future. I’ve felt ready to be a dad for the past three years. Being a parent to me means sharing the work of childcare equally. I love working but would have no issues being a stay-at-home dad either.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther preferences: non-smoker, kind, curious, witty"

      "fullText": "﻿Date me (2025): Jacob\r\nHello! Here is a picture of me looking to the left of your screen. Position a bright light there if you want to bring the photo alive.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI’ve put more pics at the bottom. Now for some words  ↓ ↓ ↓\r\n\r\n\r\n(Did this guy really copy this over from a spreadsheet?)\r\n(This works better viewed landscape on phones)\r\n\r\n\r\nOk cool. Welcome to my document. Welcome to Zombo.com my date me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAge\r\n\t37\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tHastings, UK (this is ~1h20 – 2h from London by direct train)\r\n\tHeight\r\n\t178-179cm, depending what time you measure me. (We’re taller in the mornings.)\r\n\tJob\r\n\tI'm a freelance web analytics consultant. I've been doing this for over seven years (funnellinsights.com).\r\n\tRelationship type\r\n\tMonogamy or monogamish fit me well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've got experience in:\r\n- Long-term (up to 3 years+) monogamous\r\n- Long-term (3 years+) open relationship\r\n- Meaningful but non-exclusive connections with people who live a long way away; swapping visits\r\n- Steady friends with benefits\r\n- Mostly just friends unless we're feeling it\r\n\r\n\r\nI've never been married/engaged or done totally random hookups with someone I’ve barely talked to. I need some sort of connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf I really fall for someone, then I lean heavily in a monogamous direction, especially romantically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMyers-Briggs (yes I'm aware this is probably more akin to astrology than science, but some people find it indicative :))\r\n\tINTJ (but this varies owing to its inherently low reliability). \r\n\tBig Five\r\n\tAccording to the scientific gold standard of \"random internet test\", I'm high for Openness to new experience and Agreeableness, and moderately high for Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these are very mixed, however – I'm not prone to anxiety, but I do think quite a bit about the consequences of my actions. I take doing what I said seriously, and I’ve owned literally all areas of my work life entirely alone for over 6 years, but I'm more inclined to be a little disorganized. \r\n\r\n\r\nExtraversion here is also covering the fact I am the classic \"best one to one/very small groups, likes time to recharge\" introvert. But at parties/conferences, I actively approach and talk to new people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tInteresting link so even if you don’t like this profile, you get something out of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEvery Noise at Once\r\n\tWhat I'm looking for\r\n\tI'd like to find a long-term partner, and that's my main goal and my main priority. I want something I can invest in over the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also happy with just about any other kind of connection, including new friends. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs I live in Hastings, and most potential people live in London, I'd be happy to swap visits (I love showing Hastings to people) or meet halfway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tKids\r\n\tGenerally lean towards wanting them. Not a deal breaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThings I like to do\r\n\tI like:\r\n- Learning new things. I find so many things interesting it's hard to delimit it, but recurring themes are \r\ni) how and why do people do what they do? \r\nii) how did things and people come to be the way they are?\r\niii) what will the future look like?\r\n\r\n\r\nI also like taking an interest in things for the sake of it. Architecture, natural history, art, fossils etc etc. It doesn't have to be part of some grand narrative or project to understand the world. If I have a superpower, it’s knowing something about a lot of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome books I’ve liked: Superforecasting, Giovanni’s Room, Science Fictions, Permutation City, The Grapes of Wrath, Being Mortal, The Precipice, Flights, The Book of Trespass, Radical Markets, How Music Works, The Gift of Fear, Deep Work, How Pleasure Works, Moral Tribes, Moral Origins, A Short History of Nearly Everything, Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?, The Routledge Companion to Ethics, Stories of Your Life and Others, The Poetry of Sex, Wild Nights, Shroom, Intuition Pumps & Other Tools for Thinking, Writings on an Ethical Life, Three Men in a Boat\r\n\r\n\r\nSome podcasts I like: Astral Codex Ten, More or Less, Making Sense, Rationally Speaking (RIP), The Happiness Lab\r\n\r\n\r\n(Listing any of these does not imply a particular level of concordance with the conclusions of their authors/hosts.)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Hiking & wild camping. Every year I do one 1 week+ walk and I'll do numerous shorter self-guided walks with maps. I've got a knack for finding secret or little-visited places, even in the south-east of England. My longest so far was walking from Kosovo -> Montenegro -> Albania and back; I have a two week traverse of some islands in the Arctic Circle planned for 2024 [edit: done this! It was beautiful. And boggy], and another traverse of a mountain range in Spain. I take a lot of care to tailor what I do to my company, so don’t fear if these sound intense. I can be very happy doing a shorter amble through the countryside.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Friends and family. This is one of the best things about my life. I’ve developed a higher-than-average number of close friendships that I work actively to maintain, and I’ve developed new close friendships right into my 30s. I have an exceptionally good & close relationship with my immediate family. My closest friends are all highly agreeable, intelligent and curious people.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Running. Trying to get my half-marathon time down. It’s useful. You never know when you might need to run 20k to catch a bus.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Gigs and live music. I see a bunch of local/UK bands as well occasionally seeing something truly international. My taste is super broad but rock, metal, and folk would be my core genres.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Cooking. I make food from plants; I’ve been mostly vegan for 6+ years. I have like 100+ ingredients, I enjoy trying things that take work to get the ingredients/recipes for (I’ve translated a few). I like novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Learning French. I got my B1 certificate ages ago, currently in the push to get to B2 and I want to pass the exam by the end of 2025. I’m currently making every francophone I meet speak to me in French. So I’ve got about 35% more misunderstandings happening in my life than usual right now, sacré bleu !\r\n\r\n\r\n- Learning more about myself. I’m an analyst by trade. I collect data about myself every day, I journal, I try to improve and figure out my personal operating manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEA and rationalism\r\n\tI've got a decent background in both worlds. I’ve read a bunch of the core books, blogs and communities. I've been to multiple conferences and have a few friends in the space. My involvement peaked between 2015-2018 when I ran my local EA city group.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think \"EA adjacent\" best covers where I am now. I appreciate it a lot if people are interested in some of the core things that motivate these movements, even if they're not directly involved in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if EA/rationalist framings are your exclusive way of really encountering and thinking through things, I may not be what you're looking for. I am more fox than hedgehog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAbout you\r\n\tI find all of the following really attractive:\r\n- Curiosity. I mean a real ranging curiosity. The kind that stops you in your tracks, literally or figuratively. A sense that you really do just have to know more.\r\n- Independence. You have your own projects going on. You like to do your own things.\r\n- Playfulness. Silliness. The older I get the more value I put on this.\r\n- Interpersonal effort. Showing up, being thoughtful, being engaged. Another one I value so much more in myself and others as I’ve got older.\r\n- Rigour (when needed). Following a line of argument is really hot?\r\n- Intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for someone roughly between 26-42, although I'd consider people outside of this if it really made sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow to get in touch/ask questions etc\r\n\tExcellent idea (did I ever tell you that you have the best ideas?) \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat thing(s) caught your attention? What’s your date me, if you have one? I'd like to know!\r\n\r\n\r\nDrop me a message! jacobREMOVETHISANTISPAMTEXTarthurfunnell@gmail.com \r\n\tMore pictures!  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd shameless pic with a dog:"

We’ll celebrate when my climate fiction novel comes out, when you get your dream job, and when the kids win their Lego robotics competitions. We’ll learn and grow together and face hard times as a team. And through it all, we’ll feel secure in each other's support -- a rock-solid foundation from which to live our values and make (not find!) our happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this resonates, read on 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\n\r\n* Age: 42 (looking for someone +/-8-ish years)\r\n* Gender: Female\r\n* Location: I’m pretty tied to living in San Francisco at least half-time for the next ~14 years, til my kids are adults. Could live anywhere within ~3 hours the other half of the time.\r\n* Sexuality: For the purposes of this document, I’m looking for a partner who is a cis or trans man, or is nonbinary with masculine-leaning energy. Hence, “straight-ish” in the summary above, although I (also?) identify as queer. Sexuality is complicated! Happy to discuss more as we’re getting to know each other! 🙂\r\n* Monogamy? Am flexible on this (open to both monogamy and ethical non-monogamy). More details in the “About Us” section below.\r\n* Current Kids:\r\n   * I have 50% custody of my two children: Tuck, 6 years old, and Astra, 4 years old. We live in Potrero Hill.\r\n   * More than fine if you have kids too!\r\n  Taking the kids to see the elephant seals at Año Nuevo (2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Future Kids: I have a good store of frozen eggs, and would consider having another kid if the right partner came along in the next few years.\r\nMore about me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I've spent my career largely in progressive activism, fighting on urgent issues like climate change. I’ve also spent a lot of time in effective altruist circles. Now I’m working to try to leverage generative AI to increase the impact of nonprofits and mission-driven for-profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBack when I was running the corporate accountability nonprofit I founded (and had long hair!) (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’m a big ol’ nerd. I’ll solve that math puzzle or go down that Wikipedia rabbit hole with you – and if we’re not careful, I’ll start a book club or something in the process 😅\r\n* I’m very active, and community is central to my life. I organize writers retreats and hikes, play in pickleball tournaments, host games nights, you name it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy to help you get hooked on pickleball, too!\r\n\r\n\r\n* My coparent and I intentionally designed a platonic coparenting arrangement from the start; we’ve always had separate households, never were married or anything. I am currently in a secondary poly relationship, but finding a life partner is my priority – I’m open to anything on the monogamy-polyamory spectrum.\r\nWhat next?\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me at datetaren@gmail.com if you’re interested! If you don’t think you’re the right fit for me, but you have an idea of someone else who might be, I’d love for you to pass this profile along to them!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for reading,\r\nTaren\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. If you want to date a different Bay Area pickleball fanatic who cares about making the world a better place, check out my friend Julia’s date-me page as well!"

      "fullText": "﻿Dear Potential Partner,\r\nWelcome to the \"Date Me Document\" tailored just for you! My name is Ian Duncan, and I'm thrilled at the prospect of getting to know you better. Let's dive into what makes our potential connection special:\r\nAbout Me:\r\nI'm a 33-year-old, down-to-earth guy residing in the vibrant city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. By day, I delve into the complexities of the insurance industry, but my true passion lies in running a small media agency specializing in aerial photography and videography.  \r\nInterests and Hobbies:\r\nI'm a man of diverse interests and passions. From the thrill of board games and video games to the serenity of hiking and camping in the great outdoors, I relish every opportunity to stay active and connect with nature. I'm also an avid traveler, fascinated by new languages, cultures, and the intricacies of meteorology. Exploring new restaurants, whipping up Indian delicacies in the kitchen, and savoring a cup of coffee are among my favorite pastimes.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPersonality Traits:\r\nKnown for my quick wit and terrible dad jokes, I bring a dose of humor and creativity to every interaction. As a kind and fun-loving individual, I value genuine connections and cherish moments of laughter and joy. Sarcasm is my second language, so finding someone who can keep up with banter and witty repartee is key.\r\nWhat I'm Looking For:\r\nIn a potential partner, I seek someone who shares my zest for life and adventure. An independent and caring individual who can engage in meaningful conversations and appreciate the nuances of sarcasm and humor would be a perfect match. Cultural understanding is paramount to me, so someone who has lived abroad and possesses a global perspective would truly resonate with my values. I have traditionally dated and been in relationships with men who were not born in the United States, but that is by no means a requirement! Ideally, my future partner is around my age (28-35), takes care of themselves physically, is curious about the world and is looking for their ‘partner in crime.’\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\nWhile physical attraction is important, it's the compatibility of personalities and shared values that truly form the foundation of a lasting relationship. If you're someone who embodies these qualities and is ready for a journey filled with laughter, exploration, and genuine connection, then I believe we could create something truly special together. Please feel free to send an e-mail describing yourself along with a couple of pictures to datethetulsaguy@gmail.com.\r\nI look forward to the possibility of discovering a meaningful connection with you. \r\nWarm regards,\r\nIan"

      "fullText": "﻿[Still looking for responses as of 12/07/25 - massively rewritten]\r\nBit cautious about identification/digital footprint, but I am happy to send pictures and identifying details via email (dmdgeorge24@gmail.com) if you write a few words about yourself!\r\nHi, I’m George and I’m a 24-year-old mathematics PhD student based in the UK. I’ll write down a few quick bullet points before writing some more detailed prose :) \r\nWhat I’m looking for, in brief!\r\n* Woman or non-binary person in their twenties in a compatible life stage (e.g. early career or PhD student).\r\n* Looking for a monogamous relationship, unfortunately not interested in polyamory. \r\n* Based in the UK, preferably England within a few hours of London, but this is flexible. If you are moving to the UK in the near future this works fine as well! I am unfortunately not interested in relationships that are likely to be online for an extended period.\r\n* A life-partner: I would not be interested in short-term or labelless relationships. A marriage would be nice for our families especially. That said, I am a slow-burn type person and willing to be very patient as a connection builds over months. If there are significant and immovable/hard-to-move barriers that prevent the relationship becoming long-term/life, then I may take this as a sign to move on. \r\n* Someone who would like to have children in the future, I have a very strong aspiration to be a father.\r\n* It “just works”. There is a bidirectional mutual intelligibility where we just get each-other. Conversation flows well. Everything is such that we can easily work through differences.\r\n* Someone who is open, non-judgemental and pleasant to be around. I am understanding of cases where the latter isn’t possible. \r\n* I have a lot of transgender/non-binary friends, so a partner should not have any issue with such people. \r\n* Someone who is tolerant of psychedelic use. Better yet, interested or actively engaged in psychedelic use. \r\n* Someone who is driven and trying to accomplish something. This doesn’t have to be work, it can be non-monetary-creative or charitable ventures. Has plans for the future. \r\n* Someone with whom I can discuss issues in a healthy way. Someone with whom a safe environment for emotional conversation is created. Unhealthy externalisation of anger/frustration in particular is a red flag.\r\n* Neurodivergence is especially welcomed, provided you are at peace with it and manage any difficulties healthily. \r\n* Someone with whom I can maintain a good balance of give and receive. \r\n* If long-distance, I’d prefer if someone was able to engage in deep conversation via text, and if this is not the case I think I’d like frequent voice calls.\r\nMe, in brief!\r\n* 6ft something, white man, beard, short hair, physically awkward\r\n* Completely irreligious \r\n* When comfortable, I am an extraordinarily calm presence. \r\n* I am driven and do not give up on accomplishing goals. \r\n* I try to say yes to new experiences unless I have a specific reason to say no. \r\n* I am very active in organising social events at my university.\r\n* I am quite good at “troubleshooting” and finding unconventional solutions to or explanations of things.\r\n* I don’t think any ask is too great of a friend or partner, provided the arrangement surrounding it is healthy. \r\n* I think I would not get on well with someone who had a strong sense that they “should” or “shouldn’t” do things purely out of social pressure. \r\n* I am a very intent listener and I ask plenty of exploratory questions. \r\n* I make active efforts to be optimistic but not toxically positive. \r\n* I am neurodivergent but I do not identify as neurodivergent (ask me about this! haha), I am against the idea of identity for myself in general. \r\n* I have been involved in BDSM dynamics in the past and fit in as a switch (though I have only ever acted as a dom in real life), however this is not a requirement for me and I won’t try to introduce elements of this unless interest is expressed mutually early on. I am not actively involved in that community anymore.\r\n* I have no physical type, come as you are\r\n\r\n\r\nIn more detail!\r\nAt the moment I’m in the midst of a self-improvement project. I’ve been trying to “diagnose and troubleshoot” issues I see in my interaction with other people. This has included improvements in physical expressivity, organising my thoughts on certain topics more clearly, trying to balance conversation dynamics, better active listening, and tidying my physical appearance. I believe I have come a good distance but this is an ongoing project and will likely be a factor in any romantic relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve had one previous long-term relationship and several online “talking stages”. As part of my self-improvement I’ve had a lot of thoughts on relationships and am very excited at the prospect of actualising them. As part of this I have a very strong ambition to become a father, having thought a lot about how I would take on my role in raising a child. \r\n\r\n\r\nPsychedelics have formed an important part of my self-development since my teens, and the surrounding community has allowed me to meet some of my closest friends. I have been very proactive in fostering such a community, being the vice-president of the Psychedelic Society at my university and running regular social events. Psychedelics have helped me develop my theory of mind, develop a stronger security in my self-control and analyse life problems. I have a blog on psychedelics which I try to write on, but I am actively seeking further dialogue with experienced explorers to develop these ideas. The psychedelic experience, at its most extreme, dissolves the distinction between the self and other. It may take some thought but one can sense a “unity” and synchronicity of themselves with those around them. I believe that this would be an utterly magical experience to share with a partner, being able to connect without barrier as pure consciousnesses. That said (!), I do not expect that a partner will be interested in taking psychedelics. I would like tolerance towards psychedelic usage and curiosity about the psychedelic experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very passionate about making an impact on people’s lives, especially in education. I have spent a lot of time giving advice to prospective university students, both in-person and on e.g. Reddit. I have also really enjoyed improving my teaching skills in-person as a teaching assistant. One of my biggest projects has been expanding ProofWiki’s coverage of functional analysis and measure theory: some of my writing appears on the first page of Google. This is something that I want to keep up into the future and would be very excited to discuss. \r\nLighter notes\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has all been rather serious so far! I have always enjoyed British comedy, e.g. Monty Python, The Office UK, Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb, Big Train, Not The Nine O Clock News, Bruiser, etc and would love to share some of these shows with people who are unfamiliar. I have very very fond memories of watching American comedies like Parks & Rec and The Good Place (a realllly cosy show) for the first time. I’m also a fan of animation like Smiling Friends, Futurama, Bob’s Burgers, and (especially) Bojack Horseman. You can also find my Letterboxd here. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m also into PC gaming, you can find my HowLongToBeat profile here - multiplayer gaming, no matter how casual, is definitely something I’d really enjoy doing with a partner. I’m very interested in the history of video games and computing, and am considering volunteering at a local computing museum.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy listening to 2000s/2010s pop, techno, emo and various shades of metal (especially metalcore and electronicore). I will be seeing Electric Callboy at Ally Pally in November. I want to go to more concerts and am willing to give anything a go provided the energy is good! \r\n\r\n\r\nI think it’s a great sign if we have compatible media preferences, but I don’t think it’s a requirement. The only thing I ask for is for an interest in things that I am interested in, and I will certainly return the interest! \r\nContact\r\nIf you’ve read this far, congratulations. Fire me an email on dmdgeorge24@gmail.com if you are interested or just want to chat. My main channel of communication is Discord, but I’m happy to use Whatsapp, Messenger, Signal etc."

      "fullText": "﻿(Last updated: 17 September 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Reading guide: Click/tap on yellow words like these[a] if you don't see a right sidebar. I'm using gdoc comments to annotate with footnotes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHello, and welcome to a time before Tinder and Match.com, where people got to know each other through a more in-depth process than one sentence, a bathroom selfie, and a pick-up line. Please allow me to introduce myself[b], and explain in excessive detail why you should date me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start, let’s get the boilerplate character sheet information out of the way. My name’s Richard Nicholson, I’m a Level 3 Human Programmer, male, age 32, straight and monogamous[c], wants kids (eventually). I live in Pacifica (tiny town just south of San Francisco) and I’m very used to hour-long drives[d] to get anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is my family knot, the Cær Niɣol!\r\n.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, who is this asshole anyways?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a creature of stories and games, but I mean both such concepts in frustratingly broad ways which become hard to express through sheer virtue of their vast scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nStories can mean obvious things like books, movies, anime, roleplaying games, and so forth, but it also means hearing about what happened to you at work today, or recounting that one time on vacation, listening to what you liked about a book (the story *of* the story is its own story), or the history of the evolution of ride ticketing models at Disneyland.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames means all the obvious things like videogames, boardgames, roleplaying games, sports, and such, but it also means things like using clever wording to layer meaning into sentences, mutilating the spirit of a rule while sticking to the letter, stepping between all the cracks on the sidewalk, or answering the question of WW1 tanks versus hippos[f] by doing research on how much force they can each exert and survive. I love exploring ideas and taking them apart; I love presenting my twisted results to others and seeing what they do with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a huge dabbler. At any given time I’m doing 3-5 “projects” (if you can count reading a book series as a project) with a dozen others on the back burner half or wholly forgotten. Not counting regularly scheduled events like watch parties, hobby club meetings, and roleplaying sessions. I try to pack a lot of fun and variety into my life. Accordingly, my hobbies are a pretty good lens through which to understand me. Here’s a smattering of my favorites:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Videogames (action, platforming, strategy, coop/team, logistics)\r\n* Rock climbing[g] (it’s like a workout, but a puzzle game!)\r\n* Books (fantasy/sci-fi, Lois McMaster Bujold, Brandon Sanderson, the Kingkiller Chronicles, and Phillip K. Dick especially)\r\n* Convoluted philosophically-inclined bullshit (Umineko, K6BD, Homestuck, Evangelion)\r\n* Sports (disc golf, minigolf, bowling, archery, curling, and wait there’s more!)\r\n* Sharing experiences and passing thoughts (I love the intimacy of seeing your interests and encounters in real time. I love to share things I find.)\r\n* Roleplaying games (various TTRPGs, e.g. D&D or Tenra Bansho Zero)\r\n* Cuddling (just being together is nice, but touching is special and important)\r\n* Board games (eurogame point salads, worker placement, action point limited, deckbuilder)\r\n* Animals! Let’s go to the zoo or go on a hike and look at birds![h]\r\n* Anime (Thunderbolt Fantasy, Violet Evergarden, FMA, Durarara)\r\n* Writing and game design (I make my own stories and games, too!)\r\n* kdrama (intrigue and mystery) (also does anyone know how to capitalize “K-Drama” and make it not look weird?)\r\n* Wordplay and linguistics (I WILL look up the etymology of that weird word, and use it for a godawful pun three weeks later. Or maybe three seconds later.)\r\n* SPREADSHEETS (there is nothing as exciting as well-formatted data! How do you rate this list?)\r\n* Music (Anything with a strong melody really. Strong lyrics to sing along to in the car, and high-energy stuff for workouts)\r\n* Nerdy documentaries on unnecessarily specific topics (like a 6-hour dissection[i] of a game about being a kid spending summer vacation in rural japan, and its thesis about childhood)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a lot more, especially in terms of dabblings I don’t actively pursue (genetics, crafting, proper walking technique, celtic knot drawing... etc.), but this list is long enough as it is. Time to nonsequitur!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sense of humor trends to postironic tastes, where something is both sarcastic (funny because it is false) and sardonic (funny because it is true) at the same time. The phrases that get reactions like “okay, that’s technically correct but...” or “that is absolutely not how that works! ...but maybe it has a point”, and especially “that’s stupid but correct/useful/great”. My true masterpieces are the ones where I say something which is deeply but subtly wrong, and you nod in casual acceptance until, “...wait a fucking second-!” Oh, I also enjoy silly and absurdist humor, too (like tone whiplash). You might have noticed that one already.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love the process of self-improvement. I used to think I wanted to be the very best that no one ever was, but then I took a closer look at the leaderboards. The games I am good at and most enjoy, I am consistently in the top 10% of the global rankings, except[j][k] when I am in the top 1%. I found it didn’t matter to me. I don’t want to be better than other people, I want to be better than me. I don’t care about being good, I care about being better. Improvement is itself the joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dating Philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nI've started trying to date without expectation[l]. Supposedly, as the ancient wisdom goes, if you live without expectation you are ready for anything. As the much less ancient but much more wise Mister Rogers said: “Love isn’t a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like 'struggle.' ” The most important parts of love aren't found, they are built. Intimacy, trust, safety, chemistry; these things don't form in a day, or even a month. These are the sorts of things that come from having been together through thick and thin, that are made of time and shared experience more than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has led me to value the friendship at the core of the romantic relationship. I don't want to overfocus on the future at the expense of the present. Those moments of connection in the present are what the future is built of and on. Worrying about what a lifetime together would look like makes no sense without first understanding what a week or month together looks like. I know in my mind that I should give that natural rhythm time to breathe and grow, to settle in to familiarity. Of course, emotionally I much prefer to take things objectively too fast and bathe in the crush phase 😂. It’s called “too” fast for a reason, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking for in a Partner\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, depending I guess on how you count, about four things I’m really looking for in my future life partner. They’re not immediately actionable issues, usually requiring gradual building of intimacy; they’re more like my areas of long term interest and focus. I’m sure these aren’t the only things I want, but these are my dealbreaker values. They are, from most to least important, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first is a mutual confidant. The kind of intimacy and trust that we can -- and more importantly, *do* -- share our secret thoughts with each other. Beyond being merely friends or close, I want our relationship to be a safe space. I want to represent safety and security to you, and I want to be able to find safety and security in you as well. I want you to be the dependable constant in my world that I can retreat to when life gets hard, and I yearn to provide that service as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second is friendship and companionship. Shared activities and aimless conversations. Someone who I can regale with whatever weird articles or dumb memes I stumbled across online that day, someone who tells me about the drama their coworkers keep starting. Watching shows or playing games together, or going out to the park or whatnot. I have some preferences on activity choice, but I’m not picky here; what matters to me is that we have fun things to do together and we enjoy ourselves doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third is a focus on lifestyle compatibility. This isn’t exactly something I’m looking for in a partner, so much as a value I am observing. A huge part of relationships is the things that aren’t fun, or the things so mundane as to escape notice. Doing chores, standards of cleanliness, what temperature is the bedroom, do we share a bed and/or bedroom or do we sleep separately, how are objects stored and organized around the house, and hundreds of other minutiae. This is a big deal and it’s the make-or-break (especially break) of many (if not all) partnerships. I’m not going to try to litigate that out here, -- it needs to be a conversation -- but it’s worth preparing this idea in our minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth and finally, kids. I don’t want kids right away, but I do want them some day. Probably one or two. I have a lot of natural inclinations both as a teacher and as a parent, and I want to channel them. Kids are great. Childrearing is another very complicated subject which, much like home lifestyle choices, tends to be assumed first and only considered once conflicts emerge. It’s definitely not a first date conversation, but it’s something that should be talked about before making a permanent commitment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this is in many ways a description of a relationship, not a partner. That’s somewhat unavoidable, as the two concepts are deeply intertwined and, well, definitionally inseparable. But you were probably hoping for some more person-scale descriptions to see if you match them, yeah? So here's that nice bullet point list of melodramatically pretentious trait descriptions you ordered:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Integrity. Both in terms of personal responsibility, and a pride in precision. Someone specific and direct when speaking who cuts off misunderstandings and ambiguities[m] before they happen.\r\n* Playfulness. This one is mostly literal and also one of the most important. It’s important to have fun, even when doing something serious. The desire to toy with things is one of the traits I find most attractive and full of depth for connection. A mischievous streak is a bonus. 😉\r\n* Conversation. I love to talk, at length. Sharing stories, investigating some random factoid, snide banter, and otherwise just experiencing the mind of another. This is a very important level of connection for me, and I find the ability to speak openly and honestly very precious.\r\n* Honesty. Not in terms of not telling lies, but as a commitment to tell the truth. To be the one who speaks up when something is wrong, even when it is uncomfortable.\r\n* Curiosity. I like people who try to learn and understand the world around them. To push past surface level comprehension and hunt for the details.\r\n* Understanding and Growth. There are a lot of things people don’t know or are bad at. Not in terms of some mystical conspiracy, but just generally people aren’t perfect. It’s important to forgive people for being imperfect, and to show some grace. This is even more important in a relationship: There will be misunderstandings, there will be conflicts. In order to make anything lasting, both of us will need the maturity to talk about what is wrong and the flexibility to learn and change.\r\n* Self. I want a partner with an inner fire. I want someone with the audacity to be herself and to shape the world to suit her needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle; or, What I’m looking for in a relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about lifestyle compatilibity[n].\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the oddities of the distinction between a friend and a roommate (and by extension, a spouse) is that the hierarchy of which traits are important is largely inverted. Small lifestyle patterns are not very important in a friendship, or even a sexual relationship, but are some of the most important things for a roommate or spouse. Does your friend do the dishes before the meal, after the meal, or procrastinate them? You don’t really care! But if you wake up every day to find your roommate’s dishes in YOUR sink, well now that might be an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating has taught me that there are so many variations in lifestyle that I cannot possibly imagine. You will have expectations of me I cannot possibly predict, and vice versa, about topics we don't even think have choices – even while things are going wrong! For example: going out to eat. When you order food on a date, who is it for? I’ve seen the unspoken and assumed “obvious” expectation be that one eats the food they ordered, that my partner will order less for themself and steal my food, that we order together and trade food, and also that my partner will order far too much and expect me to eat half of it. I’m very comfortable with the first option and somewhat comfortable with the third, and can tolerate the second, but the fourth? I was certain nobody does that, even after experiencing it for three months.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I was recently given the feedback “I didn’t think you were into me; we had a very long first date and you never tried to hold my hand” and at the time my reaction was, “Hold hands? On a first date? What kind of a SLUT do you think I am? How am I supposed to show that I’m interested in you as a person and not a sex object if we’re getting touchy so fast? I don’t want to be that guy!” Which to be clear, I understand now that this is insanity and holding hands on a first date is not a scandal. The point is that it is a key example in highlighting how impossible and unthinkable the perspectives and assumptions of others can be, and also how simple it can be to bridge the gap if you simply ask about it with your words.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m sure there are an infinite number of such unthinkable (to me) lifestyles that people really expect of their partner, which is the axis of relationship communication that is most often neglected. It’s important to talk about these sorts of ignorable issues early and build a consensus on how to act. If one is serious about a lifelong partnership, than much like committing to sitting still in a chair for the next 18 hours, you really want it to start out as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, my lifestyle has existed in so many different forms, each unrecognizable to the others (yours probably has too); I’m a person and I change. My love of learning and growth and constant self-improvement can lead me to rather drastic and sometimes sudden changes to large portions of my life: I once went from watching 6+ hours of youtube daily to none, because I felt it was becoming a burden. I once went from only doing things online to attending distant events four days a week, and then a few months later dropped all of those events and started a new workout routine. There’s also a time when I had the same meal for breakfast for five years straight. It’s hard to guess what has longevity and will remain interesting or sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human mind is capable of astonishing levels of self-modification; if you can show me a different way to live, I can incorporate (at least parts of) that into my own lifestyle, and I’ll probably want to. Maybe being with a wonderful person will remove some of my hangups: Perhaps I won’t find certain things so difficult, or I’ll find a hidden joy in something I had dismissed. Or perhaps you’ll introduce me to something entirely new, and I’ll make space to rebuild my life around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, what would living with me look like? What do I want out of that?\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’ve lived my whole life in the Bay Area. I don’t particularly comprehend the alternative[o], but there are places like Portland and Seattle where I might not notice the difference. I'm not tied to the specific location and I'm at a place in my life that I could move anywhere, but I'm not sure what living elsewhere would be like or if I'd enjoy it.\r\n* Despite the plethora of things I like to do at home, I grew up outside. I don’t just mean the near-daily trips to the zoo, but my grandfather[p] would take me on hikes every week to go birdwatching. I’ve been backpacking with the boy scouts and such, and I never want to give up proximity to nature... but also I’ve become okay with “wimp camping” full of modern conveniences, or not camping at all anymore. 😅\r\n   * I am the kind of person who could comfortably not leave their house for several consecutive months[q], and also the kind of person who can go on a ten mile hike by accident. That’s not hyperbole, I’ve done that dozens of times.\r\n* I love doing things together, even when I couldn’t manage them alone. Going to the movies by yourself just feels wrong, you know? There’s a bunch of things I like doing with others that I can’t bring myself to do by myself. Minigolf, bowling, movies, hikes... I’m sure there’s also plenty of things I’ve never thought of that I’d love getting dragged along to.\r\n   * I value time spent together very highly, but we can’t spend all our time together. Not just from a practical standpoint (e.g. employment) but there’s no activity so good you never need a break from it. I don’t know what that balance will look like; I’m sure it will vary based on which interests we align on.\r\n* The kitchen will be clean! To a like, 80% degree! Dishes can briefly soak in the sink in extreme cases, but they best be moving to the dishwasher within a day. Pots and pans do not sit dirty after a meal. If anything, I will clean them before I eat. Other parts of the house are whatever, but the kitchen is a place of industry and therefore it needs to retain baseline operational capacity. For the rest of the house, I’d much rather stay clean by not making a mess in the first place, and neat and organized can look nice, but as long as things don’t get cluttered I accept that any space that people actually live in will succumb to some level of chaos[r].\r\n* I love trips to faraway places, but I’m perfectly content with 0 to 2 such trips per year. I hate the process of traveling, the anxiety of making sure I’ve packed everything, and getting through an airport without anything weird happening (track record is startlingly bad). I love being there on the other side though!\r\n   * There’s still a lot of places I’d love to visit someday. The waterfalls of Iceland, another trip to South Korea or Japan, Australian wildlife centers, Germany, maybe another stay in Patagonia or New Zealand just because they’re pretty...\r\n   * Also, maybe having a partner with me will ease my hangups? If you turn out to be better at managing the parts I struggle with, perhaps I can enjoy the rest of it without reservation and will join you on monthly vacations. Who knows!\r\n* I am not a pet person. I am especially not a rambunctious puppy person[s]. I love animals, but I find living with them exhausting. If I am going to put in that much work, I want things in return that they can’t give. Old dogs and certain cats are alright because they’re calmer and relatively self-sufficient, and terrarium pets are great because I can ignore them and they don’t mind. But if I’m gonna have a small energetic disaster living in my home, I would hope it is a human child. Those at least learn to talk.\r\n* Cozy time is important. Talking about each other’s day, what we’ve seen and read and done recently, plans for the immediate term future, and assorted random nonsense. Time to cuddle and simply be together. I value this one a lot, it’s probably the second most intimate thing I can imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I’d like to know about you\r\n~~ AKA ways to introduce yourself to me when you’ve run out of ideas ~~\r\n\r\n\r\n* What’s your trashy comfort fic? Do you read litRPGs, HP fanfic, edgy vampire teens? Romance novels or shoujyo manga, chuuni shounen, Deep Lore stuff? Also, B-movie horror or kung fu flicks qualify. What’s your fiction vice?\r\n* What did you do this week that you don’t normally do? Nobody ever has a truly “normal” week where everything colors inside the lines of their regular schedule. So: Did you make progress on a project, or go on an adventure - maybe by accident?  What stood out to you, what did you find interesting about this week?\r\n* What’s a super cool place or event you’ve been to? It doesn’t necessarily have to be travel. A really neat museum, a friend’s unforgettable wedding, that one playground you wish you were small enough to go back to, or any sort of chaos so far out of the ordinary it defies categorization. What is a memory you cherish?\r\n* If you were suddenly freed of all obligations – and I mean all: no need to eat or sleep, no need for money, etc – what would you do with your time? When you finally have no pressure on you, what do you actually enjoy pursuing?\r\n* Any thoughts you have on dating. As a process, as a commodity in the dating app world (and why you turned to dateme docs[t]), how it does or should function, the dysfunctions to avoid, past experiences that guide your present, or your current philosophy. I'm especially interested in things you dislike about dating and how you would change it, as I would love to incorporate those lessons. It’s always a fascinating topic to hear how different everyone’s perspectives and experiences are in this field!\r\n\r\n\r\nCall me, maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this far! If you didn’t actually read this far and just skimmed to the bottom, thanks anyways for still being interested. If you want to date me, think we would be a good match, or just want to chat and go on some outings, send me a mail at elathrain@gmail.com. Tell me a little about why, and something about yourself!\r\n[a]Congratulations! If you can read this, you now have access to the proper reading experience.\r\n[b]🎵 I'm a man of wealth, and taste 🎵\r\n[c]I remain open to discussing various degrees of open relationship and/or my partner being poly so long as I’m their primary partner, although personally I am monogamous (or at least monogamish) by nature. (Besides, finding a first partner is hard enough! 😂)\r\n[d]This seems to always horrify people that I drive this far. No really, it's fine.\r\n[e]For those of the discerning eye: Why yes, I did in fact change the font to Times New Roman just for that name. The kerning on the lowercase gamma is *unforgivably _awful_* in Arial.\r\n[f]My friends started asking some \"who would win in a fight\" questions that got really out of hand.\r\n[g]I stick to indoor bouldering gyms. I like knowing there are mats if I fall even if I rarely need them. It lets me go all-out and push my limits safely.\r\n[h]Weird how this point isn’t formatted the same huh? That’s gonna bug someone... Oh wait it’s me.\r\n[i]For the curious: Action Button Reviews Boku no Natsuyasumi\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw\r\n[j]wait a fucking second-!\r\n[k]😉\r\n[l]This is harder than it sounds, and has proven more difficult than anticipated. Which might be my problem right there, that I had expectations for not having expectations 😏\r\n[m]Except of course when messing around and ambiguity is the joke. Ambiguity is a great joke.\r\n[n]The term is described far more fully in this blog article, which provides additional good foundational understanding of a relationship.\r\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner-part-2.html\r\n[o]Sure I’ve stayed briefly in the mountains and such, but that doesn't provide me an understanding of what living in the country would actually be like. It's like suggesting I move to Lothlórien; it doesn't make sense to me.\r\n[p]After he retired he became the head of the bay area chapter of the Auduban Society! Dude is a walking library of birds. Ask him about a call and he can give you the bird's full name and description from the sound alone.\r\n[q]It was after surgery in the summer of 2020, so not leaving my room was a responsible choice, not (just) a lazy one.\r\n[r]Even Marie Kondo conceded this point after her third child. Life creates chaos, and sometimes that chaos is better to manage than eliminate.\r\n[s]I learned this by currently living in a house with a rambunctious puppy. Send help.\r\n[t]Good choice, by the way!"

      "fullText": "﻿Kyle West Date Me Doc\r\n  \r\n\r\nHello all! I’m trying out this new approach to a dating profile in the hopes that it allows me to paint a fuller picture of who I am and what I’m hoping to find in a girlfriend and, God willing, a future spouse. I’ll leave my contact info below; if you think we might be a good match, please feel free to reach out. Alternatively, if you are reading this and think I might be a good fit for someone you know, I would appreciate it if you passed the doc on!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Bit About Me\r\nI’m 32 and live in the greater DC area. In the past year I finished my Ph.D. in Ancient History and started a new job teaching Classics at my undergraduate alma mater, a small Christian liberal arts college. I love introducing my students to the fascinating other world that is ancient Greece and Rome (fair warning, I’m told I can overshare a bit when it comes to the details of my favorite subjects. 🙂) Contributing to college students’ growth and success at this crucial stage in their lives is a major component of what drives me. I also have a strong desire to publish books that will advance scholarship in my field. My dissertation looked at ways that Romans thought about disability and incorporated (or failed to incorporate) people with disabilities into their society.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a practicing Christian in the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod and, though not always perfectly, I try to make faith the bedrock of my life. I had a journey from a Baptist background in my childhood into the Lutheran tradition, and my commitment to that theology is important to me. However, it’s certainly something I am happy to discuss as I get to know someone. I hope you find theology a stimulating discussion topic on dates! My hope for a partner is that we could build a family, including kids, that centers itself on Christian worship. This would shape many of the rhythms of our home life, and it would also mean putting down deep roots in the local congregation. If I had to pick the most important thing I am looking for in a spouse, it would be someone who also finds this vision compelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne last thing I think it is important to be upfront about; my interest in studying disability is rooted in personal experience. I was born with cerebral palsy, a physical disability that impacts my mobility and motor coordination. I use a mobility scooter to travel longer distances outdoors, and a cane off-and-on when I walk. I do have to adapt to some unique challenges, but with hard work, support from the ones I love, and the grace of God, I have built a life that I’m very thankful for. One of the Biblical passages that holds the greatest meaning for me comes from John chapter nine. Jesus says about a man born blind that it was not because of “this man’s sin or his parents’, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMom and Dad\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Interests\r\n* Classic literature\r\n* Fantasy and sci-fi (These first two items together make for fairly eclectic tastes. I’m the sort of person who might simultaneously be reading a Star Wars Expanded Universe novel and Anna Karenina. 😛\r\n* Games (almost any genre and format, board, video, party, take your pick)\r\n* Live theater (both attending and performing, especially Shakespeare)\r\n* Travel (especially to historically significant locations, and especially in Europe)\r\n* Movies and TV (Some favorites, It’s a Wonderful Life, The Lord of the Rings, The Wind Rises, “Chuck,” “Community,” “Stranger Things”)\r\n* Dogs (specifically, wanting my own golden retriever since about the age of six is pretty much a core memory.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Strengths as a Partner\r\n* Strong Sense of Loyalty and Duty: This one is very much a value inherited from my Dad. If we are committed to each other, I will stick by you. This is true when it comes to my friends, but I’m also confident it will be true towards my wife. And specifically in a marriage, I will strive to live by the knowledge that my calling is to lay down my life in service to you.\r\n* Unflagging Romanticism: If our relationship takes off, I will write you poetry at some point. 🙂\r\n*  I Love Sharing What I Love: Basically, nothing makes me happy quite like helping others fall in love with things I think are awesome. My family pokes fun at me sometimes because of how much I like to watch people’s reactions when I introduce them to things. And I make it a point to show that same enthusiasm when people I care about are sharing their interests. If we have the chance to date, I hope I’ll experience something new thanks to you!\r\n* Intellectually Stimulating: If you value book smarts and good conversation, you could do worse. 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For\r\n* Someone who will help me grow in my faith.\r\n* Values family; eager to have kids.\r\n* An empathetic and kind orientation towards others; practices hospitality, such that together we’ll be able to be a blessing to my students and our community.\r\n* Intellectually Stimulating: My ideal romantic partner is also a partner in learning and conversation: we should help each other reach new heights intellectually as well as spiritually.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for giving my slightly long-winded thoughts your time. 🙂 My email is kyle.west@wheehaa.com. If, perhaps, you are intrigued, I look forward to hearing from you!"

      "fullText": "willium — dating\n←\nDating Profile\nJUN 2024\nOver the last couple years, I've gotten a lot more serious about finding a life partner. This piece is an exercise in being intentional; in outlining who I am, what I bring to a relationship, and what I'm looking for in a partner. I've often struggled to articulate these things effectively, so I've decided to sit down and write this, however cringey it may be. In large part, I'm writing this for myself, but I guess it might help to share it too.\nIf you think you're right for me (or have someone in mind),\nplease\nreach out\n.\nAbout Me\nMy name is William Wolf\n(\nné Strimling\n).\nI'm 29 years old,\nbut I'm a bit of an old soul. I generally find that I relate more to people older than me. I'm on the cusp of Gen Z, but I'm definitely more of a Millenial at heart.\nI am 5' 7\" (~169cm) tall,\nif height is important to you\n. It's probably the thing I'm most self-conscious about and also my superpower, because I find that it causes people to underestimate me.\nI have a large, blended family.\nMy parents are divorced, and each has a new partner. I have three siblings: one biological sister, a step-brother, and a step-sister. I'm the youngest. I have cousins I don't have much of a relationship with, and second-cousins once-removed who I see often. There are also many people I consider family who aren't related to me at all.\nI grew up in Piedmont, CA\n, which is just across the bay from San Francisco. Most of my family still lives around there.\nI hate San Francisco because I love San Francisco\n.\nI went to the University of Washington\nin Seattle, where I studied Computer Science. I didn't really like Seattle. The weather was too dreary, and I found the people standoffish. That said, I don't think there's anywhere in the world more beautiful than Seattle in the summertime.\nI love to\ntravel\n.\nI always feel like I haven't done enough of it. New York City is home right now (and the best city), but San Francisco is the center of my world (both personally and professionally), and my heart is in Tel Aviv. Eventually, I'd like to live a life that allows for traveling frequently or even living across multiple places.\nI'm a creative technologist.\nI know that term sounds kind of bullshity, but it's the most descriptive way I've come up with of describing the work I do. Right now, I'm the founder of a venture-backed tech startup (my second one). In the past I've been a software engineer, a product designer, a product manager, a visual journalist, and a researcher. I'm most interested in the ways technology can help bring people closer together — which was the basis for my current startup and my previous one. You can learn more about my professional career on\nmy website\n.\nI am Jewish,\nand had a Bar Mitzvah, but am not very religious otherwise. However, I resonate a lot with Jewish values and find a lot of belonging in Jewish communities. So, I think of it as being an important part of my identity. I have also\nlived in Israel\n, and consider myself a Zionist.\nI am socially progressive and fiscally moderate.\nI think alignment on politics is important, so, briefly — I believe love is love, you can identify however you want, and that a woman should be empowered to choose to end a pregnancy. I support social safety nets, universal health care, and regulation against anti-competitive business practices. I love America; it's not without its faults, but I love how it enables class mobility, supports entrepreneurship, and fosters unparalled diversity.\nI'm an avid reader.\nI enjoy reading everything from contemporary fiction, to German literature, to dense biographies, to research papers, to popsci, and everything in between. I used to read 50+ books a year, but now it's closer to one every other week.\nI live an active life.\nI exercise almost every day, usually for about an hour. I enjoy weightlifting for fitness and as a sort of meditative activity. For recovery, I've been getting into yoga. For cardio, I try to run or erg 2-3x a week. As trite as it sounds, I really like walking, and try to get in at least 15k steps per day. I also enjoy hiking and snowboarding, but don't get to do either nearly enough.\nI try to eat well,\nbut don't follow a strict diet. At one point I followed a ketogenic diet, but I found that obsessing about carbs was itself unhealthy, and, more importantly, it made me unhappy. Being flexible about what I eat is one of my greatest joys — I love trying new foods and cuisines without much consideration for ingredients. That said, I do my best to avoid processed and fast foods.\nI don't smoke or do drugs.\nI sometimes drink alcohol, but almost never to the point of being drunk. I have infrequently smoked weed in my life, but it's not something I'm into. I have tried psychadelics too, but again, it's not something that's important to me.\nI'm fairly extroverted.\nI prefer being around people and enjoy meeting strangers. I maintain a lot of friendships including childhood friends, college friends, work friends, and random people I met at parties, hostels, and coffee shops. I'm not really into \"going out,\" for the most part. I find crowds overwhelming, and I vastly prefer sitting and having a conversation with someone. I love dancing, but mostly poorly at home, rather than at a club.\nI take life pretty seriously.\nI like to have fun and go on adventures, but I don't think anyone would describe me as care-free. I find what makes me happy is focusing on what gives me purpose (my work, helping people) and what gives me belonging (family, community). I love investing in relationships and projects. For most things I do in life — I'm in it for the long-haul. I don't give up easily on people or on things I believe in. I do what I say I'll do, and I show up.\nI'm ambitious, but not goal-oriented.\nI love to build things, and I get most excited about projects that have the potential to effect change at-scale in some way. I also\ntry\nto constantly challenge myself and compare myself only to who I was before, rather than to other people. I think it's nice to have goals, but either you don't reach them and feel an undeserved sense of failure, or do reach them and ask yourself \"now what?\" Instead, I try to focus on continuing to find ways to do what I love to do, so long as I'm able to provide for myself (and eventually, my family).\nI pride myself on being\nself-reliant\n.\nI don't want to ever depend on someone else for my happiness, safety, or sense of purpose.\nI love drinking tea.\nI got really into it during COVID, in lieu of baking sourdough bread. Now I collect tea, and enjoy the ceremony around it. I also love the vibe of sharing tea with friends and strangers — I find it to be intimate in a way that alcohol and coffee are not. In my senior year of college, I even did a tea-related\nsocial experiment\n.\nI practice monogamy.\nAs a rule, I don't really do 'casual' relationships, and the idea of seeing multiple at the same time gives me anxiety. I've been in two significant long-term relationships, each about 4 years long, and a few serious, shorter relationships. Ultimately, each relationship ended because we either grew apart or wanted different things.\nAs I've gotten more serious about dating, I've also become more picky. I still lead with my heart and don't care so much about your body or how you identify, but I do care about your values, habits, and goals.\nIn other words,\nI care about what you care about\n.\nPersonality\nEnneagram\n(\nabout\n)\nBig Five\n(\nabout\n)\nMBTI\n: EN(T/F)J (\nabout\n)\nAbout You\nI want my partner to value family.\nThis starts with me and you, in addition to our respective families. That doesn't mean you need to have a great relationship with your family, but ideally you aspire to. I want kids, but I am open to adoption and fostering — I believe every kid deserves a loving home, and if/when I have the means, I'd like to find a way to open mine to those who don't have one.\nI want my partner to value community.\nHopefully you care as much as I do about being an active member of your community and society at large. It doesn't matter if that means volunteering in a soup kitchen, working at a summer camp, running for office, or something else entirely, as long as you like to be involved in our world.\nI want my partner to believe in something.\nYou should be generally optimistic about the future. I find nihilism and pessimism exhausting. Ideally, our beliefs are mostly the same, but it's more important that you arrived at yours independently and respect my own. You should also care about politics and social issues, possibly to the point of activism — I find this is a good proxy for people who care about society and their place in it.\nI want my partner to contain multitudes.\nI think it's important that no one belief or aspect of your identity should dominate your personality.\nPer Walt Whitman\n, I find the mark of maturity is the capacity to simultaneously hold a set of beliefs that are apparently contradictory.\nI want my partner to value health and fitness.\nThis is a big part of my life, and it matters a lot to me that we both prioritize living a long, healthy life, for ourselves and as role models for future kids. To me, this looks like abstaining from smoking and addictive drugs, limiting alcohol consumption, and having a lifestyle oriented around being outside and moving your body.\nI want my partner to be ambitious.\nI actually prefer that it's not in the same way I am. It might be through your career — maybe you're a doctor, lawyer, artist, or are trying to effect change in the world through a newsletter you write. I think it's even possible to be ambitious about family. All that matters is that you have a growth-mindset, and happen to the world, rather than letting the world happen to you.\nI want my partner to be curious.\nI love learning about new things, and I want to share that with my partner. Maybe you value continued education, or read the news every day, or fall down wikipedia rabbit holes regularly. It doesn't matter really how you're curious — I just have a hard time relating to people who accept things at face value and don't ask \"why?\"\nI want my partner be well read.\nIt could be pulp romance; I just think reading says something about your attention span, and demonstrates an interest in engaging with new stories or learning new things.\nI want my partner to be Jewish,\nbut I'm open minded about this. I was not raised to be particularly religious, am not religious now, and don't believe in any conventional definition of God. I have also never adhered to\nHalakha\n. However, Judaism is important to me for three reasons:\nI like the culture. I find the traditions very meaningful, and like that they've persisted over generations.\nI found a sense of belonging in the Jewish community, especially in my twenties, and especially in Israel.\nI find that this is a good (though imperfect) proxy for a set of ineffable values that matter to me in a partner.\nI want my partner to be my partner.\nWhile this may seem tautological, it's important to me that our relationship is a partnership where together we are greater than we are individually. We should contribute different things to the relationship, and support each other in our individual endeavors. We are a team — my success is your success, and vice versa. Instead of allowing adversity or conflict to come between us, we approach everything that comes up as\nus against the problem\n.\nAbout Us\nI'm pretty open-minded about where life takes me long-term, so I hope you are too.\nPictures of Me"

      "fullText": "﻿So, first of all, some clarifications!\r\nDespite using the F label, I’m actually a transgender girl not in transition yet and, despite being from Europe, the “Central Europe” label is not technically correct because I’m from Italy, in Southern Europe, but that was the closest label choice lol.\r\nI am looking for a serious long term relationship. I am looking for people in Italy,and Europe (not more distant, sorry). I can do long distance relationships as well, but with the idea of ending the online part at some point and hopefully meeting some times a year if you’re far.\r\nI won’t immediately show pics because I am very shy and I value privacy, so please bear with me. Also, please if you’re looking for a very feminine looking trans girl, I’m not for you.\r\nPlease, READ EVERYTHING before actually texting me.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFO:\r\nMy name is Angie, I’m from Italy and I currently study psychology.\r\nI have a lot of passions that I often refer to  as my \"sweet distractions\", because they often consume my time, energy but especially what I should be focusing on lol.\r\nI like music, especially classical music and in fact I play the violin sometimes. I am also really interested in games, especially Nintendo ones. I have been a long time Pokemon player (I know a lot of things about the series) and I also really appreciate Animal Crossing. There are many games I haven't played and I am willing to play them at some point.\r\nI also find the Linux world very interesting, despite not being a big expert (I installed Gentoo though!) and I love languages. I have studied several languages and I am an intermediate in French, while I am trying to learn Japanese whenever I have time (spoiler: I don’t). I don't really watch a lot of movies because I tend to prefer TV series and anime. About anime, I haven't watched a lot, but my favorite ones include: Evangelion, Steins;Gate, Code Geass and Bocchi The Rock.\r\nI am a pure introvert and I like my alone time, which results in me learning the most random stuff out of curiosity and giving space to my creativity. I also write sometimes. I am not really good at communicating in real life at first, but I can get better with time.\r\nI am an atheist, but I don't mind what religion is my partner as long as they respect my boundaries and don't force me into anything (even because it won't probably work lol). I find Taoism and Buddhism quite interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY APPEARANCE AND PERSONALITY:\r\nI am pretty tall, standing at 6'1 (186 cm) and 73kg (convert it yourself, but yes I am normal weight) and I am not really a sports person, even though I don't mind taking long walks and swimming.\r\nI might not be the most appealing, but I am really kind. I am often told to be nice and calm. I value loyalty and calmness. I like listening to people, but I get very involved if we share passions.\r\nI am very rational and I am quite conscious. I like being analytical and carefully plan my choices.\r\nI do have a dark side as well. I tend to be pessimistic and sometimes I could sound almost cold, but I promise you I’m not at all.\r\nI do have some personal struggles, but I won’t expand on that for now.\r\nI also deal a lot with dysphoria, and unfortunately it’s something that I will probably have for life.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFESTYLE:\r\nI am a pretty healthy person. I have a varied diet and will eat almost everything, but I eat very healthy food. I don’t smoke and I don’t drink. I can be a good social drinker though. \r\nI don’t exercise at all, but I’m looking forward to improving on this. Overall, I am a pretty healthy person. \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I AM LOOKING FOR:\r\nFirst of all, people in Italy, but in general in Europe.\r\nI am very open on relocating, but my conditions are:\r\n* Not outside Europe\r\n* In a Country that is knowingly open to LGBT people and has good laws for them\r\n* In a city, but not too small\r\nDespite being bisexual, I have a strong preference for cis men and that’s what I am looking for. I don’t really have any preferences if not for the fact that, like many girls, I’d like my partner to be taller than me. I know it’s hard, but we all have a preference, don’t we?\r\nI am a bottom and I’d like to stay in that role. Also, I don’t like talking about sex too often, nor I am into sexting at all and you can probably forget about exchanging nudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYOU SHOULDN’T TEXT ME IF:\r\n* You’re looking for someone very appealing\r\n* You’re a bottom (I don’t wanna top at all)\r\n* You’re from anywhere outside of the EU and/or are considering moving far from the EU\r\n* You’re very very very sure of having kids\r\n* You like a very confident girl\r\n* You wanna do things too fast\r\n* You just want to talk about sex\r\n* Our age gap is more than 5\r\n* You’re not looking for something serious and lasting\r\n* You wanna keep your relationship secret\r\n* You wanna keep the relationship only online\r\n\r\n\r\nYOU’RE A PERFECT MATCH IF:\r\n* You’re taller than me\r\n* You share some of my passions\r\n* All of the “PLEASE DON’T TEXT ME IF” opposites lol\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME TESTS I MADE FOR FUN (I don’t take them seriously):\r\nBIG 5:\r\nhttps://bigfive-test.com/result/65ae5353cbd90a0008ceb6d2?lang=en\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONALITY TYPE: INFP-T\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFO:\r\n* E-mail: shirona4444@gmail.com"

Pigs. Wars and Witches : The Riddles of Culture> written by Marvin Harris, such as following doctrine or censorship without consideration or comparison (though he has enough resources to doubt), for example a Muslim guy follows a religious rule like only eating halal food in SKor, such as eating only certified-processed-beef not eating pork which is popular in SKor, though he is not in his region, and actually the cause why Mahomet the initiator of the religion Muslim had prohibited eating pork was because Middle East had been lack of supply of enough water, so water had been valuable resource, but raising pigs which had needed enough mud had required huge amounts of water, so actually Homo Sapiens in Middle East was competitor against pig for the limited resource water.\r\n5.

I enjoy being home and just chilling, but I also like to hang out  and travel with friends.\r\n A small green rectangle to divide sections of the document \r\n\r\nHOBBIES\r\nI am sort of an anxious person so I like to do activities that calm me and don’t stress me out.\r\nFor exercise, I do crossfit 5 days a week and have been practicing japanese ju jitsu for a few months.  I like doing crossfit. I started in 2016 but left during the pandemic and just got back to it a few months ago.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I have time, I like DIYing around my house, trying to make my home more homey and pretty. \r\nI enjoy hanging out with friends, going out for drinks and/or dinner. I also like spending time at home, just cuddling with my cats, and maybe watching a movie/tv show/youtube  and/or looking up stuff online.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI love camping. I enjoy being really close to nature. I like the idea of figuring things out and trying to get by on few things. I’m not a “survivalist” but I like the idea. I prefer camping on the mountains, maybe near a river, but camping on the beach is nice too (as long as it’s not too hot and there aren’t swarms of mosquitoes).\r\n  \r\n\r\n A small green rectangle to divide sections of the document \r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND PROFESSION\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Advertising and Civil Engineering. I also have a master’s degree in Education. \r\nI worked as a teacher for around 10 years (which I loved and found it very fulfilling) but I’m currently working at my family’s business which is in construction, as an engineer (site supervisor).\r\n  \r\n\r\n A small green rectangle to divide sections of the document \r\n\r\nWHAT I’M LOOKING IN A PARTNER\r\nI’d like to find someone who:\r\n*  I find funny\r\n*  has a good relationship with his family\r\n* I find attractive\r\n* is nice and empathetic \r\n* is smart\r\n* is hardworking\r\n* is financially stable\r\n* is tall (I don’t really care about height that much, but I am very tall so it might be awkward for me to be with someone super short)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyways, that’s all I’ve got for now as far as I can think of. You can reach me at shoplarimar@gmail.com"

This is K speaking.\n(I'll tell you my name later, of course. Even my shoe size. Just not sure how this 'going public with loads of seriously personal' works yet...)\nI'd like to start with some controversies, if I may - they should tickle your interest buds, all being well.\nAnd there you go, the first one has just\nlanded\n, and even without intent!\nI make up phrases in English sometimes, quite probably because it is my second language. But aren't your interest buds all the merrier now that they know they exist?!\nFor illustration\n(\nthough, a non-linguistic one\n):\nphotographic evidence of the moment when my nephew and I invented the 'simultaneous reverse swing selfie' 10 years ago.\n(I've made the whole sorcery into a 12\" video but this site wouldn't... so this is the end frame, as you can tell from the catharsis on our faces.)\nalrighty then, on with the controversies...\nI love hiking\nbut hate camping\nthese two loonies\nI wasn't supposed to befriend because\nI am allergic to dogs\nbut I've walked them for a friend with the greatest joy dozens of times\nbest sound and smell!\naaand I am allergic to dust 😩\nI'm creative (in some ways)\nand while you might not get the sense instantly, I'll have you know that I've just done an online test and it says it is one of my signature strengths, OK?!\ntime to get back to the allergies...\nI love dogs, horses and cats are OK, too, but if you have any of these living in your house, we'd be in a pickle...\nBut hey, don't write me down as 'the allergy girl'! I might be lactose intolerant and vegetarian, too, but no hayfever can sweep me off my feet!\nJokes aside (hope you've been having the time of your life so far), I'm a heterosexual female, 178 cm tall and 60 kg, give or take, and an atheist. I turned 40 three months ago, which feels so recent, but if you think about it, that's one Q already... 😶\nI live in London normally (but presently unemployed so sticking it out in a cheaper place) but if a job offer took me to Copenhagen, Stockholm or Amsterdam by any chance, I wouldn't weep my eyes out. (I love bikes and definitely prefer cycling to public transport... but not just for the bike culture, of course!)\nI work in project management in the creative industries but I've just completed a short course in environmental sustainability and oh my, there's just so much potential in so many areas of sustainable development! I firmly believe that if anything, technology and science will save humanity from exterminating this planet but there's so much everyone can do! I hope you agree with that and don't let climate despair get the better of you!\nI hate waste in any of its forms (materials, time, money, energy....). I wish I had the skills of a chemical engineer to invent more ways to upcycle/recycle waste. Or the powers of a social psychologist to ignite a grassroots movement that would turn overconsumption into something society would end up frowning upon and would eventually lead to global behavioural change... (My folks call me naive at least once a fortnight so it's OK if you think I'm a bit too far into wishful thinking, don't worry.)\nLacking the skills of scientists, though, at least I have a skeleton idea of a dark comedy tv show (in terms of flavour, think of a layered cake of Boat Story, Back to Life, After Life, and, me, of course) that would stick it into the faces of local governments (and the main one) re how much more they could actually do (or try to do) to solve/ease a bunch of social and environmental issues at local levels. We'd be following the stumblings of a 40-something main character who is completely lost on the tracks of self-development (but sane, just kind of driftwood-ish a bit), and circumstances make him/her settle into a small town community, and we watch in awe how these stumblings sometimes turn into brilliant solutions to problems without the main character's slightest awareness of his/her role in them... anyway, I could go on but you'd need to sign an NDA. However, if you have any ties to Two Brothers Pictures or Harry Williams or Jack Williams (the two brothers) or their EAs or their PAs or their postman, get in touch this instant, of course! (Ricky Gervais' management agency I had tried already, the most junior of their junior staff bounced me off in a blink of an eye, albeit, politely 🙂 )\nBut yeah, if not changing the perception of the population about overconsumption and overproduction, there are still a billion things to try, right?! I did some decluttering a couple of months ago, took crates of items to a market with the intent of donating the proceeds to animal shelters. Luckily, I managed to sell a dozen items or so. Then winter came, the books got soaked right after unpacking one time so I took the whole thing online. I created a website, photographed hundreds of clothes, books, utensils, knick-knacks, and spent ages uploading and describing everything and getting word out on local social media... then 3 books and a cheesegrater got bought. But hey, the intent was there!\nDreaming of having a small abode right by a lake\nThis spot is my favourite so far but I'm happy to go for an old Scandinavian villa on sale for peanuts with you, to do up while I can swim a lot and make lots of hot beverages for us. Or a Mediterranean little house? With colder drinks?\nAre you also scanning social media channels like cheappropertyeurope and such daily? (Ours will have solar panels and a heat pump and all the clever things, OK?)\nI asked a friend to describe me as this seems to be a frequent advice re dating profiles... so this is from her (and I am all blushing while typing):\nA clever introvert with such integrity but little confidence.\nShe values tranquility over fanfare but she is all in for adventures and creating memorable experiences.\nKeeps lots of her ideas to herself despite being a creative person, possibly due to being afraid (that lack of confidence thing...).\nIntelligent, great sense of humour, quick on the uptake but a bit sceptical first about new things. Sometimes it takes a bit of letting guards down but after that she is a truly loyal, trustworthy friend, by your side through thick and thin.\nShe is monogamous and would go for problem-solving without hesitation rather than throwing it all in way too soon. She expects honesty and loyalty in return as well: once trust is gone, it would be a rocky road winning it back.\nThe person who will fall for her (who will seriously want to make her happy) will get a most devoted wingman (woman), that's for sure. And the two of them will carry around laughing their heads off, probably. She is such fun when there's no need for walls.\nThere. Can you believe all that praise?!\nEmbarrassingly\nlovely, isn't she? But she has known me since I was about 3 years old so... 😬\nAnd you know me a little by now, too, don\"t you? - let's get pragmatic and avoid wasting each other's time (if that's the case) because wasting is so insanely stupid.\nI guess this aversion to waste accounts for my thriftiness and indecisiveness. For me it takes longer to decide on a purchase or an action plan than for most people - and if you are the kind of clever guy I'm after, it might have already clicked for you that what I'm trying to do with the best intentions is just another form of wasting, i.e. wasting time under the illusion that I'm working out the optimal usage of resources.... 🙃  how dumb, huh?! If you'd found me out, get in touch by all means. I could definitely welcome someone in my life who catches me out when I should be. And the best would be if you were patient and easy-going, too. Or just patient.\nI don't seem to be attracted to men with long hair and I am not keen on facial hair, either (I have a theory that circa 98.7% of men sporting a beard or a moustache would look incomparably more handsome without them. There's such a tiny segment of the male population who might actually benefit from growing facial hair that I could almost elevate this theory into a general rule. But I won't, cause I respect the rights of those 1,214 men to attractiveness.).\nI prefer not being taller, stronger, faster, fitter or heavier than my man.\nI'm not planning on having kids so it would be great if you didn't have/want any, either.\nI guess I am just writing this whole novella because I wonder if there's a chance after you have already lived half of your life to find someone who can add kindness and smiles to the remaining years while you want to add the same to theirs because you both understand how precious companionship actually is. Just looking for a team mate (whom I quite fancy), I reckon.\nYou don't need to be a dashing prince with wealth or have a great sense of style but as long as your sense of humour is ace and you like to fool around while also being aware that no relationship can get far without respect or honesty and that maintenance on it will most probably be needed along the way, too, we could be in for something.\nBe old enough to know that you carry the responsibility for all you do and say but young enough to still want to venture out there and enjoy tomfoolery. (38-46 would cover that, you think?)\nbirthday present\nloved it! (I mean, I didn't get the plane...)\ngood to become friends\nwith strangers who bring your food\ndidn't get this aircraft, either\nbut maaan, holding out your phone on a trike for a photo when there's absolutely nothing underneath is a thrill!\na full body shot\nis probably also expected... Serious face was art director's doing.

      "fullText": "﻿Tanner’s Date Me Doc \r\nRead on, rock on, and let me know if you want to connect! I am looking for my fellow beautiful nerd!\r\nName & pronouns: Tanner, he/him\r\nAge: 40 Height: 5'9\" / 175cm\r\nLiving Location: Groningen, Netherlands; American born and raised in the United States\r\nStudies: BSc in Psychology, MSc in Environmental Psychology\r\nOrientation: Straight, looking for a woman aka spirit-animal level\r\nRelationship type: Monogamous/ish (I’d like to establish an outstanding relationship with a partner prior to adding the complexity of a third party), I would like to raise kids with a partner and starting this process at the same time going on that particular adventure together, looking for the right partner to do life with.  \r\n\r\n    \r\nMy life as a film logline: A romantic adventure about a guy (40) who worked in IT, tv/film, and finally finished 4 intense years of university (psychology), now seeking to find a forever partner in this beautiful wide world.\r\nHobbies: learning the mandolin, learning Dutch, lindy hop swing dancing, independent films, long-distance cycling trips, hiking, skiing, writing, personal development, scuba diving, community organizing, improv, reading, writing.\r\nMy personality traits using HEXACO, which has the most validity and reliability of such psychological assessments, is Openness 96%, Conscientious 98%, Extraversion 96%, Agreeableness 95%, Emotional Stability 97%, Honesty-Humility 96%; all of these percentiles are plotted relative to a normal distribution.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends/Colleagues/People I Know\r\nHello beautiful people whom I already have the pleasure of knowing. If you are worried about “ruining the friendship,” I can promise with very high confidence that won’t happen. If you’re worried about looking foolish if you try and we do not click, I can also promise that I’ll always have nothing but respect for people who show vulnerability to reveal who they really are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\nI was born in a small town near the border of Utah but located in Colorado (US citizen, US passport). Losing myself in nature came natural to me as a child, exploring the thin air at the tops of mountains, the lush forest, and the arid badlands; losing myself in nature continues to be a lifelong love of mine. It took me some time to rediscover my bliss compass and how to use it, but once I learned (including via cognitive behavior therapy i.e., talk therapy), it opened me up. It took me on my own hero’s journey where I left the world of IT and my self-imposed invisible retaining wall, and opened myself up to vulnerability and intimacy with others. I explored storytelling and storymaking, working in Los Angeles in tv and film. I served, near the Aegean Sea, the needs of people fleeing war and hardship in refugee camps. Then I relocated to the Netherlands and returned to university dedicated to becoming a psychologist so that I could use that knowledge to help people in relation to our greatest societal challenges, earning a BSc in Psychology and MSc in Environmental Psychology. Along all these journeys I learned to be open, to try everything, to say yes, to embrace uncertainty (most of the time), and to be intimately attentive and responsive to my intuition.\r\nIn each stage of my journey, it became increasingly important that I understand the problems and sufferings of people and more-than-humans so that I can do what I excel at…bring very different people together and co-develop and bring about solutions to these consequential problems. I once heard a quote that “one must save themselves before they can save the world.”\r\nI’ve always been a late bloomer (or felt like I was a late bloomer). Late to learn to tie my shoes; try alcohol; achieve the death of my ego; have the feeling of falling in love; going on the university journey, embracing the beauty of my own body; deciding I want a forever partner (note: I’ve never been married); deciding I want to raise a family (note: I have no children). And as a luminous late bloomer, I am using this time to find my beautiful other.\r\nI have a great amount of genuine curiosity about the world and about people. As such, I discover many incredible beautiful souls and I like nothing more than bringing all of these extraordinary humans together so they can also fall in love with each other. I am a natural bringer-together of people. Example, the JamesWebbSpaceTelescope group where we have dinner parties and discuss the beauties and properties of the universe while reviewing the latest awe-inspiring imagery coming from the telescope (of the cosmos), with attending explanations of the image content. Recently I kicked off a book club focused on The Artist Way (by Julia Cameron) where we share our thoughts, feelings, challenges, and difficulties together as we complete the workbook.\r\nI am an empath, loving, affectionate, careful, and honest. I love to dance and most recently am taking lindy hop lessons. So long as I can be verbally and artistically expressive, I am full of glee, kicking off the covers in the morning and dancing my way through life :) I am a deep listener, present, communicative, and I’m told I give extraordinarily good hugs. I adore deep conversations and love the unfolding of all manner of topics, experiences, and reflections in creative-flow conversation.\r\nIt is important that I live congruently with my values; I’m going full vegan this year (2024) as it is important to me I do not cause harm to other creatures and that I live within the planetary boundaries. I now know too much about the reality of this moment so I am prompted to action. While I am a scientist I am also an artist and am spiritual. I am spiritual in the sense of feeling and reflecting on the fact that I am but one output of the universe, made of atoms that have their own lineage of existence; I explore, ponder, and rejoice regarding my own connection with the cosmos. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I Sing the Song of the Universe\r\nI am involved with practical transformations of society to achieve an existence of humanity within the planetary boundaries (e.g., depart from neoliberal economics for thrivenomics?), equality, and justice for all, while also caretaking for the more-than-human creatures. In my profession and as a hobby, I build communities. Professionally, I co-run a non-profit non-extractive consultancy that conducts research, drafts scientific-literature-based interventions, and performs project management of transition projects, all regenerative, to achieve societies that thrive within the planetary boundaries. As mentioned earlier, I used to work in IT where I would bring all the stakeholders and team members together to achieve alignment in succeeding or failing at achieving our goal as a team. With my shiny new MSc in Environmental Psychology, I do something similar but in relation to helping to move our societies into the safe/thriving zone regarding social services and planetary resources i.e., the safe and just space of the Doughnut Economics model.\r\nI also volunteer for causes that I see as virtuous, currently with Extinction Rebellion, Scientist Rebellion, Scientist4Future, and community organizer for local regenerative non-extractive food growing/consumption. Before that I volunteered with a community theater, political organizing, Make a Wish foundation, and refugee camp aid volunteer/emergency responder.\r\nMy core values are:\r\n* generosity\r\n* honesty/transparency\r\n* empathy\r\n* joy/bliss\r\n* deep listening/presence\r\n* interdependence \r\n* being in the moment\r\n* Playfulness\r\nHere are some visuals that are ever constant in my world:    \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traits I am looking for in a partner:\r\nI would love to find a special someone who is:\r\n1. Kind to others, compassionate, empathetic, interdependent approach, authentic, curious, interested and motivated – someone who ranks high on emotional intelligence and goes out of there way for meaningful exchange; let’s their curiosity lead them to investigate/research, pursues interests, is proactive bliss motivated rather than fear pushed.\r\n2. Warm, joyful, silly, playful - someone who radiates warmth, love, and joy; who has a playful sense of humor and doesn't take themselves too seriously; who finds joy in connection and in making others feel good about themselves.\r\n3. Impact driven – take notice of societal issues and takes action to bend the needle of the moment  in the direction of the good and just; a person who acts congruent with their well-defined values; who does meaningful work congruent with those values, and that they feel good about their efforts (either professionally or as a volunteer or donor or as a side project).\r\nI am quite active, flowing through life and trying out all the entrees. In sport (fencing, snowboarding, marathons, etc.), in art (improv, dancing, mandolin-learning, etc.), and I guess I’d call it “exploring” (volunteering, long cycling trips, hiking, top rope climbing, scuba diving, etc.). Additionally, I spend a great share of my time with loved ones (friends, family, and I hope soon a partner); with romantic relationships I am quite physically affectionate (as a psychologist, I thought I’d mention that my attachment style is secure attachment). I think I would be well matched with another who correlates with a good deal of the above. I am looking for one also marriage-minded/forever partner and I am also keen to raise a family.\r\nI’d love to create a partnership that is rooted in mutual consideration and support, is embedded in community regeneration, and is full of emotional and physical affection. \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to connect? \r\nI’d love to hear from you! Email me at datingtanner@proton.me. You definitely don't need to have your own date me doc, but it would probably be helpful to include a bit about     yourself, some photos, and what made you want to reach out! *The cat below isn’t mine ;)\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus\r\nWow, you are thorough!

I have lived with my maternal grandparents since I was a child. Later, I moved to several places to study in primary school, junior high school, and university. In fact, I am a person who likes stability, but I am also willing to accept new things and cultures.\r\nHainan→Guangdong→Hainan→Shandong→Guangdong(Shenzhen)\r\n          (aged0-5)     (6-14?)    (15-18)   (19-23)       (2022Work as nurse till now)    \r\n\r\n\r\nEvery time I visit a new city, the only things that interest me are food and museums. I really like to eat a lot of delicious food with my lover or do things that interest both of us.  \r\n* Future Plan\r\nDuring the three years since the epidemic, China has had many strict epidemic prevention policies. I can’t go to many places. I’m under a lot of pressure after work, and I don’t have enough free time to go to far places, such as going abroad. Therefore, I decided to prepare my registration abroad to look for opportunities. I will not return to work in China for the next 20 years, or forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Relationship experience\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first and only boyfriend till now who I met in college was a Muslim. I was hurt a lot in this relationship, and I reflected on how I should be myself and what kind of person I really am. I was emotionally unstable for a long time. I was going through a hard time and couldn't forgive the people who hurt me.I can't forgive the person who lie to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know I have shortcomings and I try to improve them. My support system is limited. I have fewer friends. Many times I will rely on my partner to give me more emotional support. I will try to make more friends and learn to be happy alone.\r\nJust keep no lies.\r\n* Love& Sex idea\r\nI think love means trusting each other, supporting each other, accompanying and growing together. I always ask myself or my future partner, why do you love me? I'm still searching till now.\r\nI'm open-minded except for anal sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm afraid of（I hate/ strange habits）\r\n* Darkness(I mean stay alone in the darkness.)\r\nThe side effects of watching too many zombie movies as a child😬.\r\n* follow religion strictly. (Hell no, I like freedom more now because of the bad experience from my last relationship,I don’t reject religion, I just can’t abide by the rules too strictly）\r\n* Cheat on me (No lies pls)\r\n* Taking pictures(No worries, I will upload my pictures soon..，ONE MORE WEEK)\r\n* I don't play any games, I just not good at them.\r\n* I have been in platonic online dating for three years (failure case) and I will try to end the long-distance relationship, I will try to meet you.\r\n* Sometimes I become talkative\r\n* Don't ask me to write letters of recommendation when we are done, I haven't learned how to be a friend with ex yet.\r\n …etc, I'm not sure"

After some difficult times around the pandemic I decided to give my future prospects a boost by getting back into education. Currently I’m a freelance tutor. I teach guitar and English (eg GCSE, primary), and I hope to advance this through taking a degree in English. I’ve always written a lot, and studying at Kings’ College London under published academics, poets and novelists I hope to increase my chances of getting some additional work as a freelance writer, perhaps in journalism or educational texts. I write fiction and poetry too. I’m quite ambitious, and I like the idea of getting into something more scholarly, perhaps even lecturing. I’ve spent much of my life as a musician, but this is something I’m less interested in now, other than the professional tutoring I do.\nInterests and personality\nI enjoy reading. Some favourite books include\nThe Left Hand of Darkness\nby Ursula K le Guin,\nCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin\nby Louis de Bernieres,\nKafka on the Shore\nby Murakami,\nDavid Copperfield\nby Dickens,\nBrave New World\nby Aldous Huxley,\nFlowers for Algernon\nby Daniel Keyes,\nThe Buddha of Suburbia\nby Hanif Kureishi,\nOryx and Crake\nby Margaret Atwood, and\nThe Mayor of Casterbridge\nby Thomas Hardy.\nI also read history - favourite periods/subjects so far include Soviet Russia, nineteenth century Europe, the French Revolution and World War II.\nThat’s all pretty heavy isn’t it…\nSo, in lighter news: I like having a laugh (despite having read books about the Soviet Union), and people say I’m funny (although you can be the judge of that). They’d probably also say I’m a sensitive soul (may as well confess this now), and it’s quite important to me to have long, deeper conversations with people. I could easily chat till 6am to people I click with. I don’t demand this of any prospective partner (!) but I don’t think it would work if our conversations lacked depth. Another thing people say of me is that I put people at ease.\nA few more things I enjoy\nMusic: I like classical these days, a few fav composers include Beethoven, Chopin and Ravel. I also like arty rock, soul, jazz and ambient; a few artists I listen to/have listened to: Bowie, The Velvet Underground, Radiohead, Sonic Youth, The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Leonard Cohen, Antony and the Johnsons.\nWalking.\nFilms and drama: I like arthouse, sci-fi, comedy and more.\nTheatre (just getting into it).\nGeneral evenings out (although to be fair staying in with good company seems more and more appealing these days).\nWhat do I want from a relationship?\nCompanionship, fun, comfort, being challenged sometimes, sharing experiences. I love children, so I would like to have kids. I tend to be attracted to big personalities, or at least people who have their own deeper interests, whether that be professional or otherwise. I respect sincerity, but I don’t expect people to tell me everything about them from day one.\nDrop me an email if this is your thing (see above for my address)."

I am driven by love and a strong desire for deep connections.  In my life, I care the most about relationships and personal growth.  I’m authentic, easy-going and highly capable.  I’m a kind and happy person with a lot of love to give, but I just haven’t come across the right person for me yet.  Maybe I’ll get lucky and this document will reach someone whose soul matches mine. 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nIn hopes of finding someone highly compatible to me, here are the things that most describe the essence of who I am from the inside out: \r\n \r\nI FEEL – I am emotional and tactile, so I’m all about feeling.\r\n \r\nEMOTIONS: I feel intensely, and I LOVE it.  I’m the kind of person that will certainly risk having my heart shattered in order to feel the depths of what love has to offer rather than to avoid emotional pain at all costs.  I am definitely NOT avoidant, and though I feel so much, I am extremely resilient.  There’s a confidence that comes from being able to trust in how you feel and not become so easily confused by your own conflicting emotions; to still be able to know where you truly stand despite being pulled in many different directions.  I am very emotionally intelligent and I’m looking for the same in a partner - this is the realm where I need to be matched with someone, first and foremost.\r\n \r\nSENSORY: As a kid I was always pretty athletic, probably because I’m more of a tactile learner.  I’m hands-on and handy because of it.  For most things, even as a beginner I would do pretty well initially because of translatable skills.  Even if I’m not fully cognizant of a connection, I can rely on having good muscle memory.  I feel alive when I get to connect through my body.  I partner-dance.  Merely saying that I do it is a gross understatement.  When I dance with another, I access my deepest self – lost in the emotion of the music and the energy exchange between two people willing to meet at the same place.  When I dance with others, I’m in another world.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI CONNECT\r\n \r\nI was the love child, so my initial purpose was to keep my parents connected, especially through long periods of separation (my dad was in the Navy and my parents immigrated here from the Philippines).  I was, hence, born to connect, and it’s a major component of who I am.  Clearly, I like to connect on the dance floor, but really, I’m open to connecting anywhere.  I’ve never been a fan of small-talk; I much prefer a deeper connection.  I am open and vulnerable; unabashedly myself, because I’m not afraid to be seen.  Hell, I WANT to be seen.  I want to really know a person on a soul-level and vice versa.  I live for that level of connection; that degree of intimacy.  I’m an extrovert so shared experiences are what I enjoy most in life, and I long to bare and share my soul with someone I know that I can trust to be responsible with me because they already practice accountability.  This is another extremely important characteristic that I need to be matched in when it comes to partnership.\r\n \r\n \r\nI DO\r\n \r\nI’m a doer.  My primary love language is Acts of Service (followed by Quality Time and Physical Touch).  For me (and to me) actions do speak louder than words, though I’m not frivolous with my words – I care about accuracy, so what I say and what I do are indeed in alignment.  As I mentioned before, I’m handy and that’s because I like to do things and enjoy learning to do things.  I have a problem-solving mind that supports my desire and ability to do the things.  I’m incredibly capable and very willing.  There’s almost nothing I won’t do for the people that I love, for I am an Enneagram Type Two – The Helper.  I don’t half-ass; I give it everything I’ve got. It’s the only way I know to “do”; it’s the only way I know to be.\r\n \r\n \r\nI GROW\r\n \r\nPersonal growth has always been important to me.  I grow fast because I keep in-check the biggest obstacle to this – myself.  I’m incredibly self-aware.  Because I’m very honest with myself and have a problem-solving mind, I’ve been able to figure myself out all along the way.  It also helps that I’m a good listener and I consider; everything.  Even if I don’t agree with something, I still consider what might be useful nonetheless.  I’m open-minded and a bit unconventional at times.  I seek truth and meaning on my own terms.  Because I connect, I’m good at putting things together, and with my heart as my trusty compass, armed with emotional intelligence, I Learn, and because I learn, I Grow.\r\n \r\nSadly, this is the realm where I find that I keep running into incompatibility in relationships.  As I’ve just written this last paragraph above, I’m now seeing how many of my natural skills and abilities come together to make personal growth almost seem easy for me.  At times I’ve encountered feelings of jealousy, intimidation or competitiveness around this because understanding myself well enough to grow effectively has ultimately given me confidence in my own self-worth – so those who don’t harbor as high of a level of self-worth within themselves tend to find some issue with me. \r\n \r\nIt wasn’t until I turned 40 that I realized that the roots of my pattern of ending up partnered with people with low self-worth lay in my familial relationships – primarily that of my father and my sister (so much for being a quick-learner! Lol!🤦🏾‍♀️).  I’ve been conditioned, since I was young, to make accommodations for their inability or disinterest in growing when it comes to emotional intelligence; expected to “be the bigger person” and just accept that they love me, even though my feelings would never get a voice or consideration.  As a result, emotional invalidation is my biggest trigger, but now it’s also become a clear indicator to me that a person may be lacking in self-worth.\r\n \r\nI’ve been duped by partners who say they are just as interested in personal growth, but lack the self-awareness to fully achieve it (clearly another absolutely necessary characteristic for someone to be well-matched with me).  I guess, deep down, I must have been wanting to step up to this battle, time and time again, hoping that I may prevail for once; effect change and rewrite the ending to the story.  Now that I am armed with this deep understanding as to why I’ve invited this energy into my life for so long, I’m finally ready to break the cycle and change the course of my relationship-fate.  I don’t need to fight this fight anymore.  If someone feels threatened in any way by my own sense of self-worth, I cannot trade any of my own in order to bolster theirs.  Though it is my nature to try to “help” and I am more-than-willing to sacrifice in the name of love, I can’t fight someone else’s own personal battles for them.  \r\n \r\n \r\nI’M HERE\r\n \r\nI am uncannily present.  It makes connection easy with me, and you can feel the difference when you dance with me or if you’ve experienced deep friendship with me.  Relationships mean more to me than anything else in life, and because actions speak louder than words, I am astoundingly reliable.  Since I’m honest with myself, I’m also honest with others in what I can or can’t handle, and hence, have a pretty high success rate of showing up when I’m supposed to/needed.  I’m easy going and adaptable if things need to change on the fly.  I’m typically not attached to outcomes; just care to be there in any way I can.  I just really care.  When I serve my community, I feel alive and often seem to be in constant motion.  I definitely don’t sleep enough.  Because I’m extroverted, I find more within me when I have someone to be there for, and I’d rather be alive than asleep.  My soul is fully awake and I live in the now.  I don’t dwell on the past; I learn from it.  I don’t expend my energy worrying about the 'what ifs’ of the future.  Instead, I try to make the now count as much as possible toward the future.  I am fully present and ready to engage.\r\n \r\n \r\nI AM READY\r\n \r\nI know what it means to be ready.  Since my very first serious relationship ended in 2005, I felt “ready” to have a kid.  Becoming a mother was, after all, the only thing I’ve always known that I wanted in life, but even though I felt ready at the time, I kept waiting for the right person.  After 15 years of hoping that the right relationship would come along, I felt like I couldn’t wait any longer so I set out to do it myself.  I found a great donor and impregnated myself at the age of 37 via a diva cup and an inversion table (I told you I was unconventional).  I. Was. Ready; ready to feel my body throughout the changes over the next nine months and ready to feel every bit of what it takes to bring life into the world.  Perhaps because I was so ready and intentional about it, it worked on the first try and I got the baby girl I’d always wanted!  My wonderful daughter is now four years old.\r\n \r\nI’m strong, emotionally and physically.  I’d like to say mentally, but I don’t know if I’ve really tested that (I’m a fan of Survivor, so it gives a different perspective on what being mentally strong looks like).  Because I’m hands-on, I want to stay strong for my daughter, so I go to the gym.  I want to keep myself ready to remain fully engaged in her growth and development.  She is at the heart of who I am and everything I do, but I still have more love to give.  After fulfilling my own dream and ensuring that I could have my child on my own terms, I am now even more ready for partnership.\r\n \r\nI’m made for partnership.  I’m a team player and I am conscientious and intentional about working toward the longevity and sustainability of a relationship.  I have the good sense (and experience) to understand the ramifications of struggling in a partnership where you are ill-matched, and I now understand that even though on a soul level you can feel like someone is your person, it doesn’t work if you’re not both ready at the same time.  I need someone who’s ready to BE a partner; ready to be THE partner; AND ready for family life.  It’s the final criteria in the list of characteristics that I need to be matched in.  Without all four of these things, a partnership is not likely to work, for either of us.\r\n \r\nI am ready for a true teammate; ready to talk about all the things: past relationships, individual journeys, deepest desires, bucket lists, family, adulting, parenting, keeping the flame alive, conflict resolution, the inevitable failing of health, etc.  I am ready to devote myself and plan for a future where we can support each other and grow together.  I’m ready to prioritize the family that we create whether we build it, meld it, or merely sustain what we have.  At the moment, having another child is still potentially viable for me if it’s in the stars, and that works for me regardless of whether I’m paired up with a man or a woman.  I am open to doing it all over again in a loving, supportive partnership.  Of course, there is an expiration date on the possibility for me to conceive again, but fortunately, not in regard to a relationship.  I waited 15 years to have my child and I’m willing to wait as long as it takes for the right person in partnership, if there is indeed a true match out there for me.\r\n \r\nI have practiced being in relationship.  I have practiced living with others.  I have practiced being there.  I have practiced stepping up.  I have practiced nobility.  I have practiced giving.  I have practiced enduring.  I have practiced letting go.  I have practiced growing.  I have practiced resilience.   I have practiced humility.  I have practiced humanity.  I have practiced loving with all of my heart.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI have practiced being the type of partner that I want to have.

Here are relational positions that I have/had with partners, ranked in order of desiring preference:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. coliving + filming + babymaking (as monogamous or non-exclusive)\r\n2. coliving + filming (as monogamous or non-exclusive)\r\n3. coliving + babymaking (non-exclusive, monogamous)\r\n   1. everything below as non-exclusive\r\n4. filming\r\n5. fwb + coworking\r\n6. partner\r\n7. teacher/“student”\r\n8. date\r\n9. friends\r\n10. stripper (me)\r\n11. ons/fns\r\n\r\n\r\nBabymaking requires that I get to raise and homeschool them, ideally parenting as a family together, though some career women have been interested in birthing but letting me raise them (though I do require child support in this case).\r\nFilming, if you didn’t pick up, is of pornographic nature. Though i’m deeply interested in SFW content creation with friends or partners too.\r\nI’m accustomed to being the breadwinner (and caretaker) tho i get super turned on by women who pay for me - i've been a sugarbaby in the past. My spirit animal is an apartment kitten raising his little ducklings.\r\ni’m a sub, this means i like to be on bottom but will dom if asked. I identify as a uhaul lesbian, and apparently have an anomalously high sex drive (averaged 3x/day with cohabitating partners, 1/day low end, 12x/day high end - as in yes, sustained every day, day after day, week after week, for months) as it supercharges my productivity everywhere else in life. I have extremely high levels of compersion, meaning I get pleasure from and aroused when my partners have sex with others or imagine me as someone else, I like to be used as a toy. I’ve never cheated on anyone during 13 years of monogamous relationships."

      "fullText": "﻿Lexi's Date Me Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nHello, wonderful souls! I'm Lexi, a 25-year-old cisgender, heterosexual female on the quest for someone who shares my zest for life (orange ya glad you’re here)🍊, has a love for nature, and possesses the magic of social and emotional intelligence. I spent a few years in Big Pharma, but I got out because I wanted to wear the white hat (Olivia Pope reference). I am now in education. I work as an Admin Assistant in a public high school.   \r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs? I work with children. I don’t snort, puff, or partake in drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrink? I like craft beers, however, I am on a holistic alcohol-free journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Wisconsin/ 608.920./ USA Midwest\r\n\r\n\r\nFramework:\r\nI am a science nerd. I love science and will always be an advocate for communicating science effectively. As a writer, I believe there is always a story to be written. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a proud black woman. I believe in women’s rights and that women should have the autonomy to choose if they want access to abortion services. From a historical framework, I believe in the importance of CRT. I am a product of the black diaspora. I am multilingual (not to brag or boast). I am Fluent in English and Spanish. I am nosey in French. And conversational in Dutch. If you are a fan of banning books in schools/public libraries, please leave this page. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout Me:\r\nI'm a spirited individual who finds joy in life's simple wonders. From exploring enchanting trails to savoring a tranquil sunset, I believe in cherishing every moment. My friends describe me as warm, empathetic, and always ready for a good laugh. I value deep connections and believe in the power of understanding and emotional resonance.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For:\r\nI'm in search of a man who is kind, gorgeous, generous, funny, and sweet. Ideally, you aren't afraid of traveling via a plane, and you have an active passport🌍. You have your own and can hold your own. Someone who shares my passion for nature, someone who can revel in the beauty of the great outdoors. Whether it's a weekend getaway immersed in nature's embrace or simply appreciating a stunning sunset together, I hope to find someone who finds peace and joy in these experiences. Additionally, a partner with social and emotional intelligence is someone I'd love to journey through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I don’t have any (I work with them all day). I want a minimum of 35 passport stamps and collective cultural experiences before popping out a kid. I don’t want to raise a child in America. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Interests:\r\nNature Adventures: Hiking, Kayaking,  Being outside, and any outdoor escapades.\r\nMindful Living: Practices like meditation and yoga to maintain balance.\r\nCultural Exploration: Delving into new cuisines (with a special emphasis on flavors and spices), attending live performances, and embracing diverse cultures.\r\nReading: A bookworm at heart, always eager for the next captivating read.\r\nDancing. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFood Section:\r\nI have a deep love for the rich tapestry of flavors and spices that food brings into our lives. Exploring diverse cuisines is a delight, and I believe that a good meal is an experience to be savored. It's important to note that I am allergic to seafood, shellfish, and all water creatures. Additionally, I follow a dairy-free lifestyle (85%). I can’t consume raw dairy. Despite these limitations, I relish the challenge of creating and enjoying delicious meals that align with my dietary needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I Offer:\r\nLoyalty and Support: I believe in being a steadfast partner, ready to weather any storm. Monogamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdventurous Spirit: Always ready for new experiences and crafting lasting memories.\r\nCommunication: Open and honest dialogue is the foundation of any relationship. I am committed to expressing thoughts and feelings with clarity and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm Not Looking For:\r\nI'm not interested in casual flings or relationships lacking depth. Polygamy isn’t my thing. I value connections with substance and am seeking someone who shares similar intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing Thoughts:\r\nIf you're someone who adores nature, possesses social and emotional intelligence, and enjoys a culinary adventure with a focus on vibrant flavors and spices, I would love to get to know you better. Let's embark on a journey together, exploring the wonders of life and building a connection that stands the test of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe we might be a great match, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see where this journey takes us!\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: email me (hellolexii101 at gmail dot com)"

I’m Nita\r\n32 | female | 5’5” | Atlanta, GA (location agnostic) | seeking camaraderie & companionship\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Essentials  \r\nOn a mission to build community with other open-minded, interesting individuals\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways asking questions, endlessly curious\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing resourceful and interdisciplinary, enjoy drawing from multiple domains to solve problems, embracing epistemic humility\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritize considerations of harm/care above other moral foundations like ingroup, authority, or sanctity  \r\nPrefer people that are kind rather than nice. Nice is telling me what I want to hear; kind is telling me what I need to hear. The former prioritizes keeping the peace while the latter prioritizes growth and accountability.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore of a slow burner than a spark chaser. I like to establish a strong foundation of friendship and get to know someone well prior to anything else\r\n\r\n\r\nLove to laugh. My sense of humor can be characterized as witty, punny, and/or eccentric\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermined to reduce sentient suffering through chronic disease treatment and prevention, precision medicine, and microbiome research\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways up for good conversation, civil debate, or a walk in the park! Prefer experiences to things\r\nThe Nice-to-Haves  \r\nIntrigued by both the arts and sciences: Consilience is a personal life philosophy, along with Sagan’s “Pale Blue Dot”\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth mindset: Person in progress, perpetually in beta, like to learn by trial and error, constantly iterating\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding common ground with people of all walks of life: I believe there is something to be learned from everyone we meet and want to avoid the trap of living in an echo chamber or falling prey to confirmation bias\r\n\r\n\r\nCook most meals at home, albeit to manage disease symptoms and with a limited repertoire\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t take myself seriously: Life is short, why waste valuable time on public opinion? But I still value constructive criticism!\r\n\r\n\r\nPassionate about minimalism, stoicism, and intentional living\r\nResilience would probably be my dominant trait; I’ve endured more chronic illness suffering than most people see in a lifetime  \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy banter, improv comedy, DIY, Tiny Desk concerts, scicomm, podcasting, & trivia\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen to children and adoption, strong nurturing instincts\r\nThe “Needs Work”\r\nAmbition outstrips physical limitations\r\n\r\n\r\nHealing from trauma related to medical gaslighting, neglect, & abuse\r\n\r\n\r\nPredominantly secure attachment style but can display anxious traits, such as trouble advocating for myself and voicing needs and limitations during bouts of severe illness\r\n \r\nNot too comfortable with large crowds on account of dysautonomia, potential for mast cell triggers, and the social isolation that accompanies chronic illness\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic illness affects my daily life in many ways. Most prominently, my energy is limited, I experience 24/7 pain, and maintain a somewhat small radius.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this may change in the future, I currently can’t meet people for coffee or drinks and prefer walking through nature or doing something outdoors as alternatives.\r\nA Few Favorites\r\nBooks\r\nNonfiction\r\nConsilience, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Pale Blue Dot, Burn: The Misunderstood Science of Metabolism, Exercised, A Brief History of Time, The Rest is Noise, Thinking Fast and Slow, Attached, The Trouble with Passion, Getting Things Done, Nonviolent Communication\r\nFiction\r\nSix Degrees of Separation, The Sound and the Fury, To the Lighthouse, The Phantom Tollbooth, Tuck Everlasting, Invisible Man, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Waiting for Godot, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Franny and Zooey, Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, Far from the Madding Crowd, Letters to a Young Poet, Calvin & Hobbes\r\nMovies (partial to coming-of-age stories and documentaries)\r\nAkeelah and the Bee, Jumanji, Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting, Back to the Future, The Sound of Music, The Rainmaker, A Few Good Men, The Shawshank Redemption, Matilda, Say Anything, The Illusionist, Stand and Deliver, Critical Thinking, School of Rock, Dangerous Minds, Freedom Writers, To Sir With Love, The Imitation Game, Theory of Everything, Pi, Hidden Figures, On the Basis of Sex, Queen of Katwe, Little Man Tate, The Hate U Give, The Color of Friendship, Hala, Coda\r\nMusic (will listen to nearly any genre or language)\r\nRosalía, Sadé, 112, New Edition, Jacob Collier, JoJo, Mýa, Chloe x Halle, Arooj Aftab, Fleetwood Mac, Ludovico Einaudi, Bond String Quartet, Maldita Nerea, Seal, Dave Koz, John Tesh, Vivaldi, Dave Matthews Band, U2, Sting, The Police, Sarah McLachlan, R.E.M., Duran Duran, Rolling Stones, Metallica, Nirvana, Pink Floyd, Death Cab for Cutie, Within Temptation, Regina Spektor, The Doors, Sara Bareilles, Simon & Garfunkel\r\nTelevision Series\r\nLessons in Chemistry, Dark Matter, Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, Good Trouble, The Chase, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Gentefied, Superstore, Speechless, Friends, Loot, Little Fires Everywhere, Little Voice, Swagger, Las Azules, Normal People, The Queen’s Gambit, Jeopardy!, Whose Line Is It Anyway?\r\nPodcasts & YouTube Channels\r\n3blue1brown, Primer, Physionic, Veritasium, Kurzgesagt, Sabine Hossenfelder, Vox, More Perfect Union, Johnny Harris, Diary of a CEO, The Proof with Simon Hill, Elizabeth Filips, Jay Clouse, Big Think, Heidi Priebe, guitaro5000, The Well, What I’ve Learned, Answer in Progress, Nick Norwitz\r\nSchools of Thought, Ideologies, Values, Interests (loosely held)\r\nAutodidacticism, minimalism, polymathy, multipotentiality, compatibilism, intersectional feminism, universal basic income, disability policy reform, patient advocacy, systems biology, network medicine, healthspan extension, 80,000 Hours\r\nJust for Fun\r\nParticipated in SSC’s 2019 Annual Adversarial Collaboration Contest\r\n\r\n\r\nAttended in-person Jeopardy! auditions and met Sarah from the Clue Crew\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderably double-jointed\r\n\r\n\r\nDropped out of college due to health challenges\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t put much stock in personality tests, but MBTI deems me an INTJ-turned-INFJ, Enneagram pegs me 4w5, analyst according to DiSC, and a questioner (someone who fulfills internal but not external expectations) in the four tendencies framework\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything here resonates, I’d love to get to know you!

I’m a 46, female, living in Mallorca, Spain (originally, from Ukraine).\r\nI’m looking for a genuine connection with a gentleman who shares my zest for life, my passion for travel and intellectual curiosity. Ideally, someone around my age who values communication, empathy, and laughter. I appreciate a curious mind, engaging conversations, and mutual respect. It's important to me that you're ready for a serious relationship and willing to put in the effort to build something meaningful together.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nI'm a travel-obsessed real estate agent based in the beautiful city of Palma de Mallorca. My weekdays are packed with helping people find their dream homes, but come weekends, I'm out exploring every nook and cranny of this captivating island—or sometimes, sneaking away to quieter spots to recharge amidst nature's beauty. When not on the move, you'll find me catching the latest movies or losing myself in the pages of a compelling book.\r\nAs an extroverted soul, I thrive on social interactions, but there's nothing quite like the tranquility of home after a bustling day. I'm all about striking that balance. A passionate binge-watcher, I dive into shows to unwind and recharge for the next adventure. Direct, witty, and brave—those are the words others have used to describe me. I value honesty, humor, and fearlessness in navigating life's twists and turns.\r\nLooking for\r\nI'm on the lookout for a true partner, someone with a taste for adventure and a longing for a committed, monogamous relationship. If dark humor is your thing and trying out new dining spots excites you, we might just click. At the moment, I'm open to a long-distance setup, with the hope of eventually transitioning to a short-distance relationship.\r\nWhile I'm not in a rush to settle down, envisioning a few years down the road, I dream of sharing a sea-view apartment with my partner. It's that future perspective that drives me—a life together, exploring the world, and having our own tranquil space.\r\nIf you’d like to date me, contact me via email yulyru@gmail.com, or follow me on Instagram yulyru_1."

I’m optimistic, active and loving person. I adore books, especially classics: Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev. My favorite book is “And Quiet Flows the Don” by Mikhail Sholohov. It is a heartbreaking novel about family, friends, terrible, but realistic war and relationships between people. \r\nI think it’s enough for the first time. Have a great day!"

Until recently, I’ve always lived in co-ops and group houses (5+ people), and really love most things about group living.

In grad school I found out that doing good was so neglected that you could save a life for a few $k. I took a job with a highish ability to donate while figuring out what to do next. GPT-3/scaling-laws happened next, and I decided that’s what I could be most useful doing.\r\nYou\r\nI’m a rather rational, analytical person and I think I’d like to find someone who is as well, but also someone who’s kind and cares about the welfare of others.\r\nUs\r\nIn previous long-term relationships (most recently 6yr), I’ve really enjoyed having someone to cook a quick meal with after work, then get outside with for a tennis match or bike ride, and finally cuddle up to half a movie, back rubs, or just reading and chatting. I’m pretty affectionate, and physical contact and emotional warmth are important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually it’d be amazing to face life as a team, optimizing jointly for what’s best for both of us. We’d support each-other’s growth where wanted and work together towards being the people each of us wants to be and living the lives each of us wants to live.\r\nKids\r\nShort version: no kids\r\n\r\nLong Version: I don’t want kids any time soon, and I’m much more comfortable committing to not having kids than to having them. The rest of this decade is potentially a particularly important and crazy time for the world, and I’m not totally sure what my life or the world will look like afterwards. Depending on what the world looks like in ~2030 I’m potentially open to kids then.\r\n(Non)-Monogamy\r\nI’ve been in various mono/open relationships in the past and am open to most relationship types as long as there’s clear and open communication about it. The important thing to me is finding the right person.\r\nContact\r\nI’m <wampiter at gmail dot com> and facebook.com/wampiter"

SF Bay Area; not looking for a long-distance relationship. Software engineer. No kids, but I'll probably want kids someday. 6'1\" tall. Atheist. Politically liberal (but with a lot of nuance). Drink socially, no tobacco or drugs.\nPhotos\nAbout me\nI'm a thinker and a tinkerer: As a kid, I was addicted to LEGOs, but my meager allowance couldn't support my LEGO habit, so in my teens I switched to coding. In undergrad, I detoured into physics at Caltech; although I was an 'A' student, I decided research wasn't my passion, so I didn't pursue a PhD. I'm now an engineer at AI research lab Anthropic. (And I love my job!) I also dabble in electronics and 3D printing, leaving behind a trail of\nhalf-finished projects, as well as some finished ones\n.\nI love spending time with my friends, even if it's just casually chatting over dinner or hanging out on a friend's couch. I'm semi-introverted -- I get along fine with new people, but my \"social battery\" gets depleted after a few hours.\nA sample of things I enjoy:\nBret Devereaux's history blog\n,\nMatt Levine on finance\n,\nChemical Safety Board investigations\n,\nr/PixelArt\n,\nr/WholesomeMemes\n,\nr/Frogs\n(they're cute! 🐸). I'm more the \"academic\" kind of nerd than the \"Star Trek and D&D\" kind of nerd, but I get along well with the latter kind. I play video games occasionally, and when I'm having a bad day, my guilty pleasure is to binge-read terrible manga.\nI enjoy being out in nature, and I ride my bike along the Bay Trail on weekends. I like road trips, and my friends and I usually go on a road trip every winter. I kinda want to travel abroad more, but I'm not a fan of long plane flights.\nAlthough I'm financially stable, my ethos tends towards minimalism. I prefer not to own unnecessary things. I like mending worn clothes and fixing broken things. My apartment is tiny, clean, and cozy. I currently live alone, but I've had roommates in the past and really enjoyed it. Living with people is a great way to form a healthy and supportive community!\nWhat I'm looking for\nRelationships should be comfortable and fun! I want a relationship where I can be myself and my partner can be herself. Good communication and mutual emotional support are important.\nI love to cuddle. Physical touch is my love language.\nIn-depth conversations are my other love language. What exactly is a leap-second? Is a certain fractal space-filling? Why weren't language barriers a problem for Vasco de Gama's voyage to India? What will happen when AI can generate infinite seasons of your favorite TV show? (It's fine if your interests are different from mine; I want to hear about your interests too!)\nI prefer to build an emotional connection before having sex.\nI'm looking for a medium-or-long-term relationship. I think I'll eventually want to get married and have kids, but I'm not in any hurry.\nI'm looking for a partner who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area; I'm not interested in a long-distance relationship.\nAlso, I hope you like pictures of cute animals, because if we're in a relationship I'll text you pictures of cute animals randomly throughout the week. 🐱\nContact info\nThink we might be a good match? Send me an email with your own dating doc, or a photo + short bio. Mention this doc so I know you're not a spammer. I look forward to hearing from you!\nMy email: timmaxw @ (the super-popular email provider that starts with \"g\")\nFor a first date, I like a casual weekend coffee somewhere near SF, but I can be flexible.\nI know it can be really intimidating to reach out and contact a potential partner! I want you to know that you aren't bothering me, whether or not it turns out to be a good match. 🙂"

      "fullText": "﻿Why Get Italian for Takeout When an Italian can Take You Out  \r\nHey, I’m Rocco. A 35 year old, cisgender, straight, male, with no kids, looking for a monogamous relationship with a woman. INFJ personality type. I currently reside on the Michigan/Wisconsin border in the US. My mother was 100% Italian ethnically, so I am Italian American, I graduated Valedictorian from a Finish American University, and I’m currently learning to speak Japanese. I’m open to relocating to meet a partners preferences, but I do own a three bedroom house with no mortgage, so that may be an enticing reason to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an associates degree in graphic design and a bachelors degree in illustration. I do freelance art and design but the majority of my income is passive and comes from investments and dividends. I have no debt whatsoever, student loans are long ago paid off, I am financially self sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuge fan of fine art, live theater, art museums, particularly impressionist and post impressionist art, love animation and comics, superhero movies, science fiction, dolphins, K Pop, EDM, Pop music, plushies, weight lifting, daily cardio, retro video games, and tabletop gaming (board games, card games, and RPG’s). I’m a certified Pokemon Professor for TPCi, meaning I judge and organize tournaments for the Pokemon TCG.\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer wise I worked for the Michigan Democratic Party off and on for a number of years. I lean left/progressive politically and liberal (in the American usage of the word) but am personally/socially conservative. Essentially I believe people should be able to lead whatever lives they wish but I am personally traditional. I do not smoke, drink, or use any drugs and am looking for a woman who is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter working for the MDP, I also worked at what was the oldest continuously printed newspaper in Michigan. That unfortunately is no longer the case since print media is dying. After that stint my mother got extremely sick to the point she could no longer do basic necessities for herself and needed a full time caregiver. It was the most stressful and difficult job I can imagine someone doing, but I’m glad I was there for her.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m an ardent supporter of many progressive causes but my experiences have lead me to be a primarily a strong advocate for disability rights, animal rights, and environmental protections. Giving a voice to the most vulnerable is my philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2024 was a big year for me. I went to Toronto Comic Con, Orlando Florida for four days at Disney, one at Universal, and one day at Kennedy Space Center, I also bought tickets to go to Japan in spring of 2025. I’m going to be in Tokyo for two weeks, Osaka for a week, and Kyoto for a week, with day trips to Yokohama and Fukui. Looking for someone who loves travel and preferably nerdy things.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now I’m looking for a life partner. An equal who I can spend the rest of my life with. My mother passed away a little over two years ago. She was the last family I had left. I would prefer to start a family but I also like the idea of traveling the world a bit before that.\r\n\r\n\r\n*   \r\n\r\nHow to get ahold of me:\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rocco.bertucci?igsh=aG82a3NqYWNtN3Uw&utm_source=qr\r\n\r\n\r\ne-mail: raber60@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/share/9BCsQBhRRkfqBEGW/?"

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me | Puja Gandhi (last updated 12/2023)\r\n\r\n\r\nHi There!\r\n \r\nI’m looking for a life partner, and decided to make this longer-style profile as a means to better articulate who I am, what I’m looking for, and maybe I find my human along the way 🤞\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Fairly traditional, 37 y/o female (5’ 2”) looking for someone who is kind, family-oriented, prioritizes being outdoors/being active, who strives for balance in life while also being somewhat ambitious. I was born and raised in the US and am a US citizen. \r\n\r\nYou can find more photos of me and my highlight reel on my instagram (I’m an infrequent user)\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a Texas Native currently ‘living’ in Seattle, Wa. I say ‘living’ because my mailing address and company I work for is based in Seattle, but I also live/work remotely from other locations. I’m a bit of a minimalist in the sense that I live out of a carry-on and checked bag for the most part and keep my other things (think ski gear/tents/sleeping bag/etc) in storage. I have been living in short term rentals post-pandemic and I like the flexibility and cost-savings this lifestyle provides (for now, not forever). \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for education/career; I have a Master’s degree in Analytical Chemistry (proud PhD dropout), and I no longer do anything chemistry related – I now work as a product/program manager for a remittance payments company. The work is meaningful to me and pays me enough to live a comfortable lifestyle that is flexible without an excessive amount of stress. I suppose you could say I ‘designed’ my career path to be this way (you can see about the unconventional path I took on my linkedin). I’d eventually love to have children, and I’d like to be a present/active mother, so I chose this career path to allow me more time to care for those close to me whom I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I have so. many. hobbies. In the winters, I teach skiing at a local ski resort outside of Seattle. I don’t mean the ‘cool’ downhill skiing, but I’m talking about dorky Nordic, cross-country skiing. I love being outside, in nature, in the snow with friends and sharing my love of the outdoors with children. I also volunteer with Outdoors for all and teach skiing through that program as well. In the fairer seasons, you’ll find me backpacking, hiking, and cycling. Prior to the pandemic, I purchased a Specialized Ruby Road bike, and have logged over 10K miles on it since then. I love road cycling, but would also love to dive into trying out a gravel-style bike as well!\r\n\r\n\r\nI love being outdoors, but I can also chill. When I’m having a weekend indoors, you’ll find me curled up with a cup of tea knitting sweaters, or taking on a design/woodworking project. One of my dreams is to have a woodworking shop, and to build a sauna in my backyard! \r\nSimple times spent cooking with friends/family, sharing new experiences with others, or enjoying a sunrise/sunset with others are what make me happiest. I have a website that I last updated in 2022 that can tell you a bit more if you’re curious. \r\n\r\n\r\nWho you are:\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is excited about finding a monogamous long term relationship leading to marriage/kids. You are family-oriented. \r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who loves the outdoors and travel\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are intentional, sincere, and ready for a long term relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAre open to living in a place where being surrounded by nature and outdoor activity is accessible and part of daily life\r\n\r\n\r\nYou love to challenge yourself and try new things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a vegetarian and have a strong preference for folks who are plant-based. If you are a carnivore or eat meat daily, this won’t work. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’d really like to have biological children of my own with someone who wishes to be a present parent.  If having children isn’t your jam, this isn’t going to be a fit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill intrigued/think this is a fit?\r\n\r\n\r\nSend me a message at gandhi.pj@gmail.com, I’d love to connect!"

Not interested in any romantic encounters. Looking for long-distance friendship in which we exchange long well-written e-mails in English and/or Russian about our subjective life experiences and how they relate to the world around us. My default mode in life is gawking, wide-eyed, at the insanity of the world around me and quietly muttering \"What the actual bloody fuck?..\" under my breath, and then trying to learn more about evolutionary biology to understand why on earth humans do these things they do. Poetry and logic both please. I want to connect with an actual human who is not hiding behind a wall of trite pleasantness and socially acceptable conversation topics. I want to talk about the meaning of life, existential dread, public policy, thermodynamics,  gyoza, your dog, shit we're going through rn and things like that. It doesn't always have to be profound; I will likely express a lot of banalities because sometimes banalities resonate. I love women, especially gay women, but you can be any age, gender and sexuality - if we click, we click. If we don't, at least we tried. I am weird and I don't click with a lot of people, so if we do click, it'll be a pleasant surprise.\nAbout me: fairly intelligent and nerdy in the sense of being academically oriented but not into typical nerd culture. Also I know as close to zero pop culture as literally anyone I've ever met. I likely have some  annoying combo of ASD, ADHD, GAD, depression and who knows what else but none of it is formally diagnosed and I have accumulated a heap of coping mechanisms; none are too effective but combined they allow to live a life that appears mostly normal from the outside. This is just so you're not surprised at my being one odd bird; otoh, this is Scott's blog, so you likely won't be to begin with.\ntkachira at gmx dot com\nExpand full comment\nReply\nShare\n© 2025 Scott Alexander\nPrivacy\n∙\nTerms\n∙\nCollection notice\nStart your Substack\nGet the app\nSubstack\nis the home for great culture"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi there! I’m Tejas. I’m not very familiar with “date-me” docs, and haven’t read too many of them, but I thought I’d write a brief one. I only recently decided to start looking for a relationship, and thought this was a reasonable place to start!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’d be potentially interested at all, please feel free to shoot me an email (you can reach me at tejassubramaniam@gmail.com) or contact me via Facebook Messenger. Feel free to tell me a bit about yourself, but even just expressing possible interest works!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’m 22, and currently an undergraduate student at Stanford (studying economics). \r\n* For some simple demographics, I’m South Asian, male, and a lacto-vegetarian. I’m also bi and gray-ace/demisexual. Politically, I’m centrist, or slightly left-of-center. I’m an atheist. \r\n* I’m broadly an effective altruist. I’ve been torn about this label before. I’m not too certain about my future plans; I think I will probably apply to masters programs, and then try to work at a research role at an EA org. I have fairly broad interests, so I could see myself working on animal welfare, AI policy/governance, or economic development. \r\n* I’m a bit introverted, although I’m working on being more social. In my spare time, I like reading nonfiction (and blog posts), playing chess online, and participating in competitive British Parliamentary debate (which is an activity I’ve enjoyed a ton). \r\n* I’m very intellectually curious and eager to learn things: I love having long conversations with people about random things I can learn a ton about, including things I know very little about. \r\n* I’m very neat and organized (although I don’t expect that from a partner necessarily). I’m good at replying to texts and emails promptly. When I’m especially interested in a project, I can be quite hardworking, but otherwise my work ethic is poorer than I’d like (this is something I’m working on myself). I don’t have excellent emotional intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a long-term relationship, but would also love to go on a few dates. I’m open to dating people of any gender. I’d also be open to either monogamy or poly; I have no strong preference on this matter, and would be flexible according to my partner’s preferences. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’d especially value a partner who is interested in making the world a better place, interested in any one of economics/math/political science/statistics, nerdy, and loves long conversations about particular curiosities of theirs. Bonus points if we share hobbies (e.g., debate, playing online chess). I’d also love to share some of our values (either on our political views or on effective altruism – not necessarily both!), but this is not a dealbreaker. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my preferences\r\n\r\n\r\n* I have a low sex drive, and don’t experience a lot of sexual attraction. \r\n* I think it’s unlikely that I will want kids.\r\n* I’m fairly comfortable with long-distance, and I’d be happy to meet/go on a date virtually. But I’d love to meet in-person too. \r\n* I’d want to date someone over 19 but under 30. \r\n\r\n\r\nPictures of me (descriptions below each picture)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m on the left, and that’s my uncle on the right. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding in front of a bookstore. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking at a debate tournament."

      "fullText": "﻿A bit about me: I'm 33 years old, 6'3\", living in NYC (and a third-generation New Yorker). I work as an engineer at Meta on Reels and I love what I do! I'm kind, happy, curious, creative, and a major nerd. My aunt is certain that I'm \"quite a catch.\"\r\nA bit about who I'm looking for: I'm currently looking for a serious relationship with a woman who is at least not closed to the prospect of marriage and children at some point in their life (with the right person, of course). Ideally someone who can pivot seamlessly between silly and serious conversation, and who is a little weird but still normal enough to charm my parents.\r\nI think I relate best to people who are some kind of engineer/scientist/nerd, but who also have a keen interest in the humanities and are generally well-rounded.\r\nFitness and health: I go on a short run most days and do some gym exercise around every other day. That said, I'm much more likely to want to talk about the podcast I was listening to while exercising than the exercise itself. I drink, but only if someone else at the table already ordered a drink. I don't smoke or use any drugs but I support decriminalization.\r\nReligion: Although I'm generally very secular (and so is my family), my cultural heritage is Jewish and I consider it a part of my identity. I love my family's holiday traditions - including Jewish Christmas (the classic movie and Chinese food) - it's as real of a holiday as Christian Christmas!\r\nFavorite day trip: Take the train to Pelham Bay Park and work up an appetite by walking to Johnny's Reef on City Island, then spend a few hours indulging in their incredibly reasonably priced seafood.\r\nFavorite evening activity: Finding an unusual off-Broadway show and convincing my friends to go (half the fun is the post-show debrief to figure out what we just experienced).\r\nMost surreal childhood memory: Eating at Mars 2112 - an immersive Mars-themed restaurant set up to look like it was carved out of red rock! It had everything - people in alien costumes, a spaceship ride, and above-average chicken fingers. It was emblematic of the kind of early 2000s decadence that we may never see again.\r\nTV triumph that I most often think about: The series finale of Nathan for You.\r\nTV disappointment that I most often think about: The series finale of Lost.\r\nTop podcasts: Normal Gossip, Maintenance Phase, Criminal, You're Wrong About, 5-4, Serious Trouble.\r\nIf money were not a concern: When I first got into programming in high school it was because I wanted to make games, but it turns out that the game industry is horrible and abusive and pays terribly, so I'd much rather be ensconced in a cushy tech job… anyway all of that is to say that if I didn't have to worry about money then I'd totally start my own game studio (that pays people well and is not abusive).\r\nRelationship to games: I wish there was a word to describe someone who likes video games but whose life isn't spiraling out of control due to a video game addiction. In any case… that's me! I love games, and I love in particular thinking about what makes them tick. I prefer a broad mix of games and usually don't stick with one for long. Some of my favorites are Baba is You, Breath of the Wild, Oxygen Not Included, Disco Elysium, Inscription, Tunic, and Kentucky Route Zero.\r\n\"He sounds great but is he a crypto/NFT guy?\": Lol no.\r\n\"He sounds great but is he a fan of Joe Rogan or Andrew Tate or Elon Musk? Or is he some other kind of right-wing sicko?\": Absolutely not!\r\nContacts: hello.there.msh@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿God help me I’m making a date me doc  \r\nAbout me\r\nHello! I’m Lawrence. Here you’ll find some basics about me, what I’m looking for in a relationship, and some of my writing and photos.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasics:\r\n* I'm a 29-year-old straight cis man and 6’3”. \r\n* I live in Berkeley, CA, but I’m not super attached to the Bay Area and I like traveling.\r\n* Looking for a long- or medium-term relationship, open to dating both trans and cis women. \r\n* I don’t know if I want kids. \r\n* I’m open to both polyamorous and monogamous relationships. \r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\n“Lawrence is pretty emotionally mature and insightful in a bunch of ways, and is happy to talk about feelings. [..] I think he might be the best person I know for helping people get over lack of intellectual self-confidence and problems with being intimidated by technical content. [..] He holds himself to very high standards, in a way that can sometimes hurt him but is also often very positive – he’s extremely receptive to feedback and is very non-defensive even when he’s upset. I think he’d be a good match for someone who wants their relationship to be a big source of growth and improvement, but also of security and unconditional affection.” \r\n– Beth Barnes\r\n\r\n\r\n“Man Lawrence, if you have romantic struggles, then there's no hope for the rest of us.”  \r\n– Nat Kozak\r\nMore about me \r\nI often feel intense emotions. I sometimes stop while walking or driving to just take in the view and reflect on how good things are. I get excited about clever ideas and am deeply touched by acts of kindness. I feel on a deep level that most people are very good and are trying their best, and it makes me really sad when they fail or have a rough time. I feel very upset when people are unreasonable, and I often feel a strong desire to fix problems I see around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty good memory. Both for dates and conversations, and for lots of random facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m eager to pick up my partner’s interests. In the past, I’ve enjoyed ballroom dancing, traveling, hiking, cooking together, stargazing, and visiting museums and exhibits. I enjoy talking about machine learning, economics, history, psychology, and random animal facts.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a dog. His name is Benji, and he’s a good boy (not really, but he is a very adorable one). \r\n\r\n\r\nI care deeply about doing good. I want to make both the world around me and the world in general a better place. I’ll stand up for what I think is right, and try to keep promises and be fair to people. (Also, sometimes I stay up all night to help others finish their projects and meet their deadlines.)\r\nWho I tend to get along with\r\nSincerity and kindness: I like people who say true things, genuinely relate to others, and aren’t afraid to wear their heart on their sleeve. I like people who do nice things for others from the depths of their hearts. Also, I think it’s fine to take lots of time and be very gentle when you do it, but I think it’s very important to be able to face hard truths about yourself or the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual curiosity: I like having conversations with a partner where I feel like one or more of us are learning something, or I can share in their enthusiasm and knowledge about a subject. \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh standards: I like people who have high standards and push themselves and their partners to grow and improve.\r\nPossible sources of incompatibility\r\nI can be quite negative. When I’m sad, I often feel like nothing is working; when I fail, I can be quite harsh with myself. I also tend to be lower valence in general, but I’m working on being gentler and happier. I sometimes express true but unkind opinions about others. \r\n\r\n\r\nI work a lot. I think it’s important to be working on productive things, so I tend to be a bit of a homebody by default and I’m not likely to spontaneously develop new hobbies. However, I think that spending time with my partner would definitely count as productive time and I’m happy to spend a lot of time with you!\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t drink or do drugs. I feel comfortable hanging out with people who drink, though I would feel uncomfortable about frequent heavy drinking. I’m also fine with psychedelics as long as you don’t take them in the presence of charismatic cult leaders. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am pretty attached to my dog. If you’re allergic to dogs, this will be a problem. Sorry. \r\n________________\r\nOther Pictures\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nContact Info\r\nIf you’re interested in chatting more or think we’re compatible, please email me at lawrencechan96@gmail.com. \r\n________________\r\nAppendix\r\nSome things I believe about dating docs and dating:\r\nDating docs aren’t (just) for finding dates. I think a significant fraction of the value of dating docs comes from the process of writing; another large fraction comes from communicating information with future partners that might not come up naturally in the first few dates. I’m also not super convinced that dating docs work well for finding new people to date, compared to e.g. asking people out in person. So this doc errs on the side of being more informative as opposed to promotional. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional and social intelligence are real and important. There are many skills in actually making relationships work, both in terms of knowing yourself and in terms of knowing how to relate to others. While I can be a fan of numbers and spreadsheets, it’s important to be in touch with who you are and what you want, and also who your partner is and what they want. Also, communication is important! \r\n\r\n\r\nShared interests are significantly less important than shared values and shared desire to make a relationship work. I think dating apps and docs tend to focus too much on screening for shared interests or experiences, which I think can easily be developed over time. (In particular, I’m happy to pick up your interests! In the past I’ve picked up the interests of previous partners.) On the other hand, deeply held values are probably unlikely to change, and I don’t think romantic relationships work without both parties wanting it to work and putting in the effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost disagreements and issues can be worked through (given shared values and a desire to make the relationship work). I think I have a lot of growth mindset for relationships; I think that many common points of disagreement can be worked on. For example, I think that issues like division of labor (for chores) or different hobbies can generally be solved if both people are willing to try. As a corollary, I think that fights are really bad in romantic relationships; the whole point is to be on the same side, and work toward a mutual goal. Accordingly, I’ve had very few fights in my past romantic relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity is necessary for people to grow in relationships. I personally value relationships that push me to grow and do better, but I don’t think these relationships can be stable without a firm bedrock of security and mutual trust. After all, it’s pretty hard to be ambitious if you feel like a single misstep could cause your partner to leave you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationships can be thought of as trade agreements, but you generally shouldn’t. Relationships are trade agreements (in the sense that every persistent interaction can be thought of as a trade agreement), and this frame can be somewhat helpful. For example, it highlights the fact that relationships should be a positive sum voluntary endeavor, and that both partners should try to provide things that are to their comparative advantage. However, I find that this framing can often cause people to take an adversarial stance toward their partners (i.e. a trade negotiation), or cause people to value tangible, concrete things about their partners over emotional support or vibes, and so don’t think that people should think about relationships this way by default. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional writing samples:\r\nI guess the largest repository my public writing is my LessWrong account: https://www.lesswrong.com/users/lawrencec"

      "fullText": "﻿Contestant #2718: Cristian Trout\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n________________\r\n    Bio:\r\nSome sort of cross between French bourgeois socialist, Midwestern son, and ironic Jew. An imposter among all except those who are equally culturally confused. Trained in philosophy, self-taught in everything else. Serious on the outside, goofy on the inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinds the unambitious, parochial life to be humble and beautiful. Finds the world too broken, and himself too privileged or hubristic to accept such a life for himself. Grinds and hustles against the hustle and grindset culture. Always curious about engineering, tinkering, science, but not a techno-optimist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes has “one thought too many,” a character flaw. Speaks mind when probably shouldn’t more often than keeps quiet when probably should speak up. Can be quite direct at times – avoids sugar-coating things. Sets high expectations for self and others. Sometimes struggles to admit when wrong, but eventually does.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking to share the ride with a life-long friend accomplice! Always striving to live more virtuously :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNB: Friends fear this dating profile is “a bit too much.” To which I respond: “but that’s very like me!”\r\nSeeking:\r\nNB: don’t think I’m only interested if you check all boxes! This is just a list of some ideal things I’m looking for. In fact, ideally we should break our ideals as well – surprise each other!\r\n* A co-conspirator. Let’s maybe go save the world? I wish to build beautiful things with my partner, at work and at home. I wish to be involved in my partner’s career, and vice versa. I wish our talents and temperaments to complement each other so as to make us a dynamic duo, a force for good :) I’m currently trying to help “make AI go well.”And save democracy. And other stuff.\r\n* Someone who challenges me. Someone well-studied in their craft or a rigorous thinker. An interest in philosophy, economics, or art are pluses! (Trading in truisms and half-baked things turns me off pretty fast.) But also…\r\n* Someone who knows how and when to shove all that braininess to the side and run down a sand dune! Pull a silly pose! Bask in the moonlight! Or cozy up with a warm cupp :)\r\n* Someone who knows Europe and or America: I’m culturally confused enough as it is, and would rather not become more so... Ideally looking for someone who understands what that’s like, since it’s a key aspect of my identity. I don’t brag my privilege of being well-traveled, and I dislike what I call “cultural tourism” (treating culture like so many colors to embellish one’s instagram feed; taking cultural diversity for granted; failing to care for, own up to, partake in, and embody one’s own culture).\r\nSome things I love:\r\n* Cooking for/with friends, hosting dinner parties, board game nights!\r\n* Tinkering: DIY repair, optics, dance, music. Not good at any of these, love experimenting anyway :)\r\n* Hiking, being in nature\r\n* Reading a poem or watching a great film and then doing a deep dive discussion with others! Off-the-cuff sampling of works I love:\r\n   * Films:\r\n      * Rashomon\r\n      * Parasite\r\n      * Lawrence of Arabia\r\n      * East of Eden\r\n   * Literature:\r\n      * Le Petit Prince\r\n      * Lord of the Flies\r\n      * Brave New World\r\n      * The Cosmicomics\r\n      * (poems by Robert Frost)\r\n      * Calvin and Hobbes\r\n   * Games:\r\n      * Outer Wilds\r\n* Watching some classic Looney Toons or an old comedy with my family (typically Jerry Lewis or Danny Kaye!) ❤\r\n* Playing some silly couch multi-player games with friends or family (Nintendo boy here!) (∩^o^)⊃━☆\r\nDetails:\r\n* Male, straight\r\n* 5’10”\r\n* 29, looking for someone in the ~28-32 range (but not strict about this). I highly value maturity, confidence and resilience in a partner.\r\n* Seeking primary, long-term partner.\r\n* Preference for monogamy mostly because I’m pretty certain my attention/affect would be spread too thin for me in a polyamorous relationship. However, I’m not into possessive exclusivity (I don’t get jealous and feel slightly uncomfortable with people who easily get jealous).\r\n* Demisexual. In the realm of relationships “I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires.” I become loyal very quickly, and I’ve long prioritized intellectual and platonic connections. But it takes me a while to get comfortable with physical touch (something I’m working on). I promise though, I love cuddling :)\r\n* Love languages that currently come easiest: quality time, acts of service\r\n* Mix of intro- and extroverted? Medium-sized social battery? I like meeting new people occasionally, and love hosting or hanging with friends. But after e.g. a fun weekend of full-time social exposure, I need a day or two of quiet to recup. I lean heavily toward quality over quantity of friendships.\r\n* I think I’d like to have children one day, but I have lots of uncertainty here.\r\n* Currently in Boston but pretty flexible: could move to basically any major city in US or EU. Preference for East or West Coast of US, France or UK.\r\n* Fluent in English and French (would love it if you are too!)\r\n* Current work: AI policy researcher, screenwriter.\r\n* B.A. and M.A. in Philosophy\r\n* Vegetarian when I’m ordering, flexitarian otherwise. (Would struggle to live as a vegan: cheese is a strong part of my identity. Could be swayed.)\r\n* Not religious\r\n* Non-smoker, glass of wine on occasions\r\nHow to proceed:\r\nIf you think you’d like to meet, or chat with, feel free to reach out at ctroutcsi@gmail.com, or here on messenger, or text me at 781 518 8996! (I think messenger or text are more reliable, since emails will sometimes go to spam…) If you’d like to learn more about my work/hobbies, feel free to visit www.ctrout.art.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know it can be intimidating to reach out, but of course I made this doc to meet new people, so don’t be shy :)\r\nMore Photos    \r\nDid we mention hubris?"

Hopefully you find what you are looking for, if while reading this you feel a connection I encourage you to reach out to me at nblogist1 @ gmail.com .\nRemember you don’t need to meet the “requirements” 100% and  you hopefully think that I do not need to meet yours by 100% either, I truly believe in getting to know each other, being flexible with one another, growing together and making some changes to adapt for the best :)\nAsk me: how I traveled internationally without a passport. 🛂\nPICTURES!\nWho am I?\n1 Word edition:\nPassionate\nDriven\nTraveler\nAdventurer\nSwiftie (just a little :) , not the friendship bracelet level)\nTraditional\nDetails:\nI am 24 years old living in Dubai; While also technically living nowhere due to being a global citizen. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan 🇵🇰, so you know I have got those good genes ;), moved to Dubai very well into my nomad journey; Been to over 10 countries yet! Have lived for an extended period of time in 4 countries. 🇹🇷 (Turkey) has a very special place in my heart (Guess how many times I have been, make sure to add this in the email for a chance to win a prize!)\nPassionate / Driven: Although I have been in love with computers since grade 1 and literally graduated in (Software Engineering). I have always have had love for business, starting my first serious venture at the age of 17.\nOne of my recent adventure lead me to start a natural stone, mining, fabricating and import/export of Natural Stones like Marble, Onyx, & Granite.\nTraveler /Adventurer: I love hearing, learning and understanding people from different backgrounds, this usually takes me to far edges and deep inside the countries I visit. I love to understand different cultures religions and love to learn about people’s lives. I also LOVE seeing different landscapes, I love history and have an imagination, a longing to know answers.\nSwiftie: Haven’t been to the Eras Tour but done the movie and might attend the Singapore tour next year. My friend pointed out that I have an abnormal number of TS songs and that I am a swiftie. Although I have seen how passionate swifties are, I am not as much. I just like the songs, some of my favorites being: August, Back to December, Shake it off, Love Story, Anti Hero, Paper Rings, and getaway car. Country Roads is also one of my fav ones! (Do mention some of your fav songs in the email! Excited to hear from you!)\nTraditional: Growing up in Karachi with my diverse family has instilled traditional values in me. I grew up in a very accepting, diverse, loving environment and that reflects in the way I carry myself, and how I interact with people around me.\nWho am I looking for? - I wrote an article earlier about this here."

I'm Anna Crow/Anna Magpie, haven't settled on that yet, a 23-year-old trans woman living in the United Kingdom.\nAs of writing this (1:17am BST, September 5th 2024) I am in the process of attempting to independently fundraise my salary so I can go to Stanford and run a longitudinal study monitoring tens of thousands of different biomarkers on people beginning, then throughout gender affirming hormone therapy, in order to begin to develop a foundational understanding of how to coordinate complex signaling pathways in real world biological systems.\nI am\ncurrently applying to computational biology PhDs mostly in/around London. My core interest is in understanding biology “across scales”. How do we integrate molecular biology data into a coherent whole in order to make useful predictions about disease, with a particular focus on aging. A subquestion I find particularly interesting is the extent to which regulatory networks are defined by complex, non-linear interactions vs simple additive ones. This question has big implications for combination therapies and, more generally, how fast we should expect biomedicine to progress.\nM\ny life is a little up in the air at the moment, I'm currently staying at CEEALAR, but hopefully moving to London sooner rather than later.\nPolyamorous by default. I want to have one or two people that I'm extremely special to, and as long as I feel special to someone I can't bring myself to care about whether they're having sex/romance with other people; monogamous relationships just sound like too much work.\nChronic infodumper, if we date, you can expect rambles on things like\nBiology, especially cellular biology, the mechanisms of aging, and mathematical models of evolution. Evolution is a better engineer than you are and I will tell you exactly why\nMilitary history, I have a particular interest in the development of early semi-automatic firearms, and how this was influenced by institutional thinking around infantry doctrine. However I'm a modern warfare geek in full generality. Also I have strong opinions about people with strong opinions about the F-35.\nAquaculture and ornamental fish. I’m a keen tropical fishkeeper, although I haven't been able to pursue this seriously lately due to the housing constraints associated with being a student.\nIf you also like these topics, that's great, but if not I'm probably happy to listen to you if you ramble as well.\nGenerally eclectic, very into HEMA (Historical fencing with an emphasis on the martial art), bouldering, hanging out in places which have neat people to talk to (hackerspaces, etc.), and photography, almost exclusively wildlife, but someday I'll get into astro (even if you don't do that part with me, it would be great if you accompanied me on the outdoor walks. You will learn about birds and you will enjoy it). I also like to read: Trying desperately to get out of the rationalist monoculture, so have picked up “An experiment in criticism by CS Lewis” and in the middle of “The guns of August”\nI have extremely strong feelings about moral responsibility and individual virtue, especially as they relate to interpersonal relationships. In general I think that the biggest distinction between me and others isn’t intelligence or aptitude, I just care more. I also value serious, precise thinking and try to be fairly ruthless about avoiding what I can best term “vibes based analysis” alongside discouraging it in others. I’ve deliberately cultivated an instinctual uneasiness about hard to falsify claims. I want to date someone who helps me to be a better thinker, a better truthseeker. Stress test my claims, point out when I'm being more of a soldier than a scout and judge me for it, etc.\nMy ideal partner would be someone kind, extroverted and intelligent, who likes when I ramble and can ramble back at me, and enjoys cuddling me and having me occasionally draped over their arm. You should be an independent thinker who tries to avoid uncritically reciting  recieved opinions. Ambitious or at least interested in improving yourself to a similar degree that I am, and willing to help me as I start assembling the life I want outside of university.\nThe tone of this document is possibly a little stand-offish, that's just my writing style. I am an extroverted, 6’5” trans woman with motor coordination issues; this makes me an inherently ridiculous person. I\ncan't\ntake myself too seriously. “Bouncy” probably captures my default orientation in most social settings. Again, go scroll through here for a much better sense of my demeanor\nhttps://x.com/WillowChem?t=22xAPEwWkuqYKqLvKf_l2w&s=09\nIf this sounds intriguing to you, the easiest way to get in touch is going to be discord or email\nDiscord: aclockworkmagpie\nEmail:\nannacrow@proton.me"

See options here.\nCreated on: @September 28, 2023\nLast updated on: @October 9, 2025\n✅ Basics\nName: Marta\nLocation: Currently in Bremen, Germany for the foreseeable future\n(when dates) is looking to date: men\nRelationship style: currently monogamous\nCurrently: partnered\nDoesn’t want kids.\nPersonality summarised in a meme\nSolving the world’s most squeaking problems.\nALT\n🧭 Navigation aka ToC\n💁‍♀️ What you’d be getting into\n💡\nSome labels I identify with*: vegan, atheist, effective altruist, aspiring rationalist, eating disorder, digital nomad (now ex).\n*with a caveat “keep your identity small” (PG)\nOn a good day my autocomplete is like the old, GPT-2 with high temperature. Random, but not always appropriate. It shows in thought jumps, abstract (sometimes not very PC) humour, and high openness to new experiences.\nOn a bad day, my world view becomes narrow and negative. There are in me parts that are self-critical and sometimes won’t shut up, especially about intellectual performance and body shape.\nSelected thinkers & media that influence(d) me: Sam Harris, Finite and Infinite Games (James P. Carse), Kurzgesagt, Spencer Greenberg, Y.N. Harrari, Tim Ferriss, Tsurezuregusa (Kenkō).\n😆 Laughing. Examples of things I find funny\n⭐ Amazing. Top features to be aware of\nClick the arrows for examples\n🙃 Adventure seeker (but also a badger). I enjoy new experiences, especially if they involve new/body sensations and comfort zone expansion. At the same time, I need a lot of time for myself, or just hiding from everything. It’s sometimes challenging to discern whether it’s adequate boundary preservation or a way to excuse avoiding challenges.\n🤩 Projects, plans, excitement! I usually have side-projects and self-development goals that I work on alongside work. Organising events or outings for groups of friends is something I gravitate towards. In the best of moods I like to break or play with social conventions.\n😺 Curious communicator. Several people have remarked that I have good communication skills, which makes it easy to talk to me. I aspire to be more comfortable with tell culture, try to practice NVC, and enjoy exploring different ways of understanding relations between people (authentic relating, circling).\n⏰ Organised. Being tied to my schedule gives me a sense of comfort. In extreme cases I become quite anxious when my schedule faces a danger of being disrupted. When I spot this tendency, it’s a sign to deliberately disrupt it, typically by travelling somewhere.\nBONUS! Want to see results of some personality tests?\n😠 Challenging. What others can find difficult about me\naka previous dealbreakers or just things that were somewhat hard for others, these are basically the other side of the coin of the top features above!\nI sometimes work a lot. I like to talk about my work, because I also try to work on projects that feel meaningful and interesting. Together with personal projects, it means my time is limited. It can be hard to incorporate into it a relationship with someone who doesn’t share many of my interests or goals, or doesn’t want to participate in the events I organise.\nI often need to spend time by myself/keep a lot of bandwidth for myself. This is aside from work time, relationship time, and previously organised social time. This can be a dealbreaker for people who need a lot of attention from their partner.\nI ask many questions and often need many clarifications about what others mean. People who are not used to this style of communication can see it as antagonistic, or motivated by a specific capital-A Agenda. In reality, I deliberately try to avoid Agendas.\nOut-of-norm way of dressing or behaving in public places—some find this uncomfortable. Are you one to play along?\nI have eating habits and food-related behaviours that can be seen as strange. E.g. My main sustenance for days on end can be potatoes with mustard, or buckwheat with broccoli. I also have irrational aversions towards specific food items (e.g. will not eat pizza), so cooking for me can be hard. For people who love sharing three meals a day, or for whom food is a central point of focus, this can be challenging.\n✌️ Doing. Hobbies, interests, goals\n7 years of trying\nALT\nI treat my plushies to a lavish life.\nALT\nCrafts of all kinds!\nALT\nCanoeing!\nALT\nMaking gifs of myself is among the things I do\nALT\nI have some distance to myself, and am not ashamed of wearing this bucket on my head in a Russian banya.\nALT\nWork-wise see LinkedIn.\nExercise. I do sports everyday, admittedly somewhat compulsively. Usually strength or running. I’m always up for trying more sports. Recently embraced my millennial girl destiny ✌️and got into yoga (power and aerial hammock).\nProjects. I like to make things, virtual (e.g. no code apps) or real (e.g. collages, objects). I’d like to make more. Examples.\nWoo-adjacent and “weird” activities. I’m curious to explore what strikes me as weird, mystical, or new. You’ll see me attending ecstatic dancing events, cacao ceremonies, non-verbal communication workshops. My epistemological foundations should be sound enough to protect me from adopting any aura-based worldviews that are often prevalent among the crowd that attends these events.\nThings I like to, or find easy to talk about: language learning, start-ups, product development, productivity tips, sleep optimisation, relationships, anki.\nA (definitely non-exhaustive) list of things that I want to try, do more of, or learn:\na museum visit\nALT\n🙅‍♀️ What I’d not be getting into\naka. my dealbreakers\nLack of self-awareness or ability to take responsibility and work through one’s own issues. We all have problems. I expect a partner to be aware of theirs and actively work on them.\nLack of acceptance for the idea of reducing the consumption of animal-based products. If not vegan, I’d like a partner to be at least open to eating less meat. Being a judgemental prick about vegans is a dealbreaker.\nBeing tied to living in one place. Travelling is an important part of my life, and I’d like my partner to travel with me at least some of the time. In the long-term (ok, even mid-term) I’d like to have “a base”—one city that I feel bound to. But, even then I envision spending 3-6 months a year somewhere else.\nAversion to sexual exploration. I’m kinky enough to have a FetLife profile and occasionally attend fetish parties and sex/body-positivity workshops. You don’t have to always join me, but a total lack of interest would be a dealbreaker.\n🫶 Togethering. Relationship views & preferences\nHow I’d like for both of us to feel when we’re together.\nI’m looking for a stable partnership/companionship where we protect and prioritise each other, while staying separate individuals. It’s important to me that we inspire and support each other in becoming better versions of ourselves, whatever it means to each of us.\nThey say: you’re an average of the five people who you spend most of your time with [citation needed]. I want to share—and make an honest attempt to live by—the same values.\nWhat are these? Some ways of thinking about it:\nMy intrinsic values: Freedom, Truth, Learning, Virtue, Non-Suffering [1]\n12 virtues of rationality\n5 secular values*: truth, compassion, freedom, courage, responsibility. (*which I believe I got from Y.N.Harari, but Google’s not helpful finding the quote)\nHow do we do it?\nPffff, you tell me! We talk (a lot), we question each other’s views, we try new ways of learning about ourselves, read poems, write code, dance, take psychedelics, whatever’s necessary.\nIn short, we try to work on it.\nBecause relationships are work.\n(I realise, I’m making this a hard sell. 🙃)\nIn reality, we’ll probably first vomit on each other our childhood and relationship traumas and see how they interact. We’ll have to deal with it—it’s healthier to do it consciously and and openly.\nThe status quo of relationships seems to be that you become emotionally entangled to some degree. It’s fun to be all about each other for like 3-5 months, but is suboptimal in the long term. Enmeshment is the Moloch of relationships, and fighting it requires some effort. Answering the timeless question “where do I end, and where do you start?” will likely be an ongoing project for us to work on (but that’s not a bad thing!).\nI also see us living as a part of a community or a group of friends, not as an isolated unit that exists against the whole world.\nI’m very conflict averse. I prefer to keep a “low-threshold”—bring up every small thing that I find bothersome, discuss every minor interaction that seemed awkward. I believe that this approach—based on radical honesty, mindfulness, and authentic relating practices—helps prevent resentment and larger disagreements from arising. Generally speaking, good communication is good!\nI realise this^ can sound a bit heartless or bitter.\nSo.\n🌊 ………….. To put it more poetically …………….. 🌊\nI’d like us both to feel comfortable sharing silence.\nBut, also to sometimes go out to party together until 4 am [2].\nI’d like us both to give each other freedom to explore the world separately to then recount stories about what we discovered.\nBut, to also have a shared goal, worldview, an idea or project we aim towards or build together.\nI’d like us to write poems and read Less Wrong, build sand castles and destroy false beliefs [3].\nAnd, if we decide to not be together anymore, I’d like us to not regret the time we shared.\n💌 What now? Contact\nIf you got to here (thanks for reading!) and think that:\ndating Marta sounds like it could be your game 👉 write to me at SoYouWantToDateMarta [at] gmail [dot] com\n→ ❗As mentioned above, I’m not currently emotionally available for dating. I’ll take your email as expressions of interest for the future.\n→ send me your dating doc if you have one!\nit’d be cool to be friends (or just found this an entertaining read) please write! Getting even just two sentences of positive vibes/feedback will make my day.\n“omg, her and my friend [NAME] would really get along!”, feel free to forward this doc to your friend [NAME]!\nyou’d rather love to hire Marta as a marketing pro (not an unlikely result), add me (but write a note too) on LinkedIn\nWhat if you already know me?\nI recognise it might feel awkward to bring up the dating topic in a regular conversation. To open the topic of a potential more-than-friends interest, feel free to contact me through the regular channels (WS, Telegram).\nI know it requires a lot of vulnerability to do that, because: What if I’m not interested? If I’m not, I’ll gently tell you that, and we’ll stay friends.\nIf you think you’ve already signalled romantic interest in a regular conversation and I didn’t respond (e.g. you tried flirting and I didn’t flirt back), I’d still encourage you to write to me. I can really be blind to these signals. Unless I’m explicitly told “hey, I like you. Do you wanna go out with me for like a date-date?”, I might not get the message.\nFootnotes:\n[1] Based on Clearer Thinking Intrinsic Values Test.

      "fullText": "﻿David’s Dating profile\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSummary\r\nI am a disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m an assistant professor working on Bayesian social and formal epistemology, the philosophy of AI, and the foundations of physics. Somehow I have ended up with two PhDs, one in particle physics, and one in the philosophy of science. I am something of a polymath. My Erdős number is less than or equal to four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kind, thoughtful and curious. I am excited by, and open to new ideas. I strongly value openness and honesty. I am shy, introverted and almost certainly terribly socially awkward. I am a neurodivergent trainwreck. I am often found at the epicentre of a whirling void of chaos, but this is just by coincidence. Imagine a confused and profusely apologetic teacher running in late to teach their class, and dropping their books everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am vegan, somewhere on the (highly heterodox) left politically, feminist, and very loosely adjacent to (or aligned with?) effective altruism and rationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am (very) British. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important to realise that I am definitely not “fun”. Don't even *think* about trying to take me on an “adventure”.\r\nInterests\r\nMy interests are rather eclectic. I particularly enjoy discovering new, elegant and holistic ideas that simplify and unify a great many threads: this applies not just in physics, but in every field of human knowledge. A selective summary of some things I often think about might include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Physics – especially quantum field theory and particle physics. \r\n* Philosophy – my specialisms are in formal and social epistemology and the philosophy of science, but let’s face it, every area of philosophy is almost definitionally interesting.\r\n* Rationality and Bayesianism.\r\n* Cognitive science and artificial intelligence – obviously.\r\n* Why isn’t my code compiling?\r\n* Politics/economics/sociology. \r\n* History.\r\n* Music and music theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, please let me stress this list is non-exhaustive. I am generally very fascinated by other topics as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder at the nature of time, space and the cosmos. I marvel at the mysteries of human history and the patterns exhibited in human societies, minds, biological structures and other complex systems, deconstructing and analysing the various media of human culture. I am particularly fascinated by the problems of epistemology, and other areas of philosophy. How should we interpret quantum field theories? Is it possible that the Universe is deterministic? What does it mean for A to cause B, and does that imply a direction in time? What makes time so different from the dimensions of space? When are two scientific theories equivalent? Is scientific knowledge cumulative? How can we justify the use of Occam's razor in induction? How important is the \"look elsewhere effect\"? Why does anything exist at all? How strong is the anthropic principle? Is a high level of artificial intelligence imminent and what are its implications for society and the economy? Should we aspire to have a society without work? Is it OK to have incommensurable moral values? How culturally contingent is the modern, Western ideal of liberty? Is it possible to improve human happiness or are we stuck on a hedonic treadmill? Also, how can we save the political left in Western Europe in a time of globalisation, secular stagnation, and a resurgent China? Is the Eurozone doomed? How can we save the Labour party from itself? A question possibly more intractable than anything else posed here! When I am out and about, I often think about urban design, public spaces, and architecture too. Or I mull over post-Soviet hauntology. I particularly enjoy discovering new, elegant and holistic ideas that simplify and unify a great many threads: this applies not just in physics, but in every field of human knowledge. There are, I think, few forms of happiness greater than the satisfaction that arises from the creative application of thought to a problem and discovering a brilliant solution. I love being introduced to new ideas, so if you think you know something that would interest me, please do share it!\r\nPersonality\r\n* INTJ-T or INTP-T depending on the test (I treat Myers–Briggs as a convenient summarising tool rather than a highly credible scientific model). \r\n* Presumably Ravenclaw (obviously a much more objective model).\r\n* Neutral Good alignment.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed I’m quite eccentric. I generally have a very high willingness to deviate from social norms, and I’m usually unphased by weirdness in other people. In some ways, I might take this too far: I instinctively veer away from groupthink, tribalism or veneration/idolization, in a way that probably can make me seem disagreeable. I seem unusually disinclined to naturally align my opinions or attitudes towards those of other people around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sprinkle a lot of what I say with very subtle and dry humour, which very few people understand or notice. From this, you should probably conclude that I'm actually not very funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very open to new ideas, and generally curious. I am very much a high-decoupling thinker, although I see the value of being able to think in a low-decoupling way too. I do enjoy exploring ideas in a way that can sometimes come across as unintentionally controversial or provocative. I can comfortably suppress this, but I think I get on best with people who also enjoy thinking in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kind, patient and good at listening. I am generally very forgiving of mistakes, and tend not to hold grudges against others.  I highly value kindness and magnanimity in other people. I don’t tend to take differences of opinions personally, and I am very open to criticism. I don’t tend to get angry easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nI strongly value openness and honesty, and I get on best with people who also share these values. I like to build relationships on intimacy and trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can dislike people who are very loud, arrogant or domineering. I am generally very sensitive to power-balances between people. I have a streak of culturally puritanical moralism. I like integrity, authenticity, and the calm search for enlightenment. I dislike extravagance, gaudiness, and unjustified grandiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like my life to be zen. I do not tend to get on well with high-drama people. I am a good demonstration of Karl Friston’s Free Energy principle because I try to avoid surprises, both good and bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am usually very polite and obliging to the needs of other people. But I mostly prefer it if people are willing to openly assert their needs and desires. I strongly adhere to “ask culture”. However, occasionally I can overthink things, in a way to ensure I do not inadvertently pressure or harm other people. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very ambitious and motivated. People tend to perceive me as something of a workaholic; however, this is only the case with work I passionately enjoy, or am very stressed about. I am a terrible procrastinator at everything else, especially anything involving admin. I can be very strong-willed on certain things; unfortunately motivating myself to do things I find tedious is not one of them. Some people find that I can be very stubborn; like some non-Newtonian fluids, my rigidity can increase under pressure.\r\nPsychology\r\nSometimes I feel like the fated star-child, but then the camera dolly-zooms, and in a dizzying gestalt shift I realise that I am actually a barely-functional human being. It bemuses me that some people find this profile intimidating, because in truth I am usually a chaotic mess, stumbling from one fiasco to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, I am “neurodivergent”. I think I am autistic (self-diagnosed), I have ADHD (sort-of diagnosed) and I am dyspraxic (actually diagnosed!). The possibility that I might have ADHD only occurred a few years ago (I had a complete misconception of what this was); since then I have been taking vyvanse/elvanse (lisdexamfetamine), which has improved my life incredibly. The only comparable experience I can think of is when I first put on glasses. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this, I am mostly a scatter-brained, highly forgetful disaster. I am naturally fairly incompetent at most basic day-to-day tasks. I do my best, but my best is usually pretty terrible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I probably haven’t mentioned this yet, but I am also highly forgetful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of many types of social interactions, I am pretty spectacularly awkward. I am usually better one-on-one than in groups, but I generally prefer large groups to small groups (more opportunities to hide). I am very introverted, by which I mean I tend to find social interaction very exhausting. This decreases when I grow more comfortable with someone, but usually it is still somewhat tiring. However, I actually really love exploring getting to know interesting people, and I generally do enjoy and value social interaction. I’m just able to do much less of it than some people, and need a lot of time to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, I think I am actually very good at intuitively understanding and emotionally reading people. This is something that I have never found difficult. However, there are probably some social conventions that I miss or don’t understand. That being said, I don’t think my understanding is all that bad: there are some advantages to viewing things as an outsider, a sort of alien anthropologist. (But of course, I might not know what I don’t know!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have high levels of anxiety overall. This is very much lower than it used to be, but is probably higher than average. I had OCD as a teenager, and still have some mild OCD tendencies (yes, I am mildly triggered by the poor alignment of the images at the top of this profile). In the past, I have experienced some mental health problems including depression. In recent years, I’ve been remarkably happy and mentally healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last seven or eight years, I have felt increasingly more alive, and reinvigorated. A lot of my mental health problems have become less severe in one way or another. I have gradually been learning to fall back in love with myself. This has been an extremely romantic process.\r\nPhysicality\r\nPhysically speaking, you could describe me as an organic, self-organising, irreversible, dynamic, non-linear, open, dissipative system, far from thermal equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s not what you were looking for? Fine, fine, if you really insist, here are some more “salient” features. I am:\r\n\r\n\r\n* 34 years old\r\n* Anatomically male\r\n* British (obviously)\r\n* Average height (around 175cm, or 5 feet, 9 inches tall)\r\n* Average weight (with a bmi around 23 at the time of writing)\r\n* Presumably not unfit (I am a fast walker, and I run 6 days a week)\r\n* In no way \"in shape\", unless the shape you have in mind is some sort of blobitectural abomination (perhaps a Gömböc?)\r\n* Physically healthy (except for very mild asthma)\r\n* White/caucasian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have:\r\n* Green-brown eyes\r\n* Disaster hair\r\n* Glasses due to being short-sighted.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can probably infer my approximate appearance from the pictures, some of which were even taken within the last decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Things\r\nI am genuinely (yes, genuinely) open to forming many kinds of new connections, or just seeing how things evolve. That could include forming friendships, relationships, or other things. However, I would prefer to meet people without strong expectations or assumptions about a relationship escalator.\r\n\r\n\r\nI quite like the polyamory model, and my prior experience with it has generally been successful.  I would be open to various relationship models ranging from monogamy to relationship anarchy, with the right person or people. I see pros and cons of different models. Overall, this is something I am more pragmatic about than ideological, and in general I am fairly flexible. One partner said (perhaps accurately) that I was too much of a relationship anarchist to ever identify as one.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. I do have some ongoing entanglements, so I may not be compatible with very strict forms of monogamy. I am open to looser forms of monogamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of the particular model, I try to form relationships on as rational a basis as possible, allowing a particular arrangement to develop naturally between individuals. I very much tend to view each friendship/relationship on its own terms, which means that they often don't fit easily into socially-established categories. Genuine communication is essential. Again, I take openness and honesty as very fundamental prerequisites for being able to interact with other people in the most positive possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to dislike “new relationship energy”, and don’t experience this as strongly as some people seem to. I experience very little immediate attraction to people, rather this grows gradually as a relationship develops and we build a connection. I can be quite romantic and value intimacy very highly once I become close to someone. However, for me, I find that romantic feelings are mutually, consciously cultivated; I never really “fall” for people spontaneously. I like relationships to evolve slowly, and grow stronger over time. \r\n\r\n\r\nI find physical intimacy to be an important and valuable feature of relationships. That does not have to be sexual (I have had successful and happy relationships with asexual people). I find sexual activity to be a highly unique experience with every person; it is something I prefer to take slowly and gradually evolve. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe gender of a partner is not an important component in degree of attraction towards them. In that sense, I am happy to identify as “bisexual” or “pansexual” or “queer”, whichever is most conducive to good vibes or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dislike uneven power dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my relationships, career, finances, social setting etc are all in good shape, I would certainly consider having children with a suitable partner or partners. \r\nIdeologies and Identities\r\nI am generally fairly anti-tribalist, and don’t easily fully align with any groups. I tend to adopt far too many heretical views. Nonetheless, I’ll do my best to situate myself within the broad ideological contours of the contemporary moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find politics interesting, and appreciate the importance of both policy and realpolitik. Overall, I broadly lie on the pluralist, progressive left, although this varies quite considerably, depending on contexts and issues. Economically, I sit somewhere between radical social democracy and market-oriented democratic socialism. Constitutionally and socially, I am very much a liberal, or perhaps more accurately I increasingly identify with classical civic republicanism. However, my views on particular policies and parties can be surprising; I instinctively avoid tribalism and political dogma, and try to borrow widely from a range of ideas. I am generally cautious of overarching grand narratives or overly simple ideological frameworks. I have some sympathy towards radical aims, but try to be pragmatic in my views on how to achieve them. I think democracy, liberty, equality, and constitutionalism are all good ideas, and many of the most interesting questions are about the best way to reconcile them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of political parties, I currently most closely align with the soft left of the Labour party in the U.K., though I’m rather hard to classify. Apparently (contrary to my claims in the previous section) I have some repressed masochistic inclinations because I’m still a Labour party member.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very much a feminist, mostly influenced by some ad hoc mixture of radical and intersectional ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a culture wars irenicist, in that I think the culture war itself is bad and harmful. However, I am exasperated by both sides of these battles. Overall, my views are idiosyncratically radically progressive, but in some ways also quite culturally conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very much a philosopher in every sense of the word (although please be very careful, because I am mildly allergic to metaphysics). Insofar as I have a philosophical project, it draws from the traditions of logical empiricism, subjective Bayesianism and Skyrmsian naturalism. And of course, I am very dedicated to physics (although our facebook relationship status is currently set to “it's complicated”). I still lean towards some sort of hidden variables approach to quantum mechanics (in spite of my scientific anti-realism). I do see the appeal of an Everettian interpretation, but I have some deep, unresolved doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEthically, I have some sympathies with a utilitarian stance, but I may not be purely utilitarian. Decision theoretically, my views are not very settled, although I am not a naive causal decision theorist. Worryingly, I am not fully decided about whether that pushes me towards a sophisticated evidential decision theory, or some form of timeless decision theory. Either way, that means that my practical ethics looks a lot more deontological in practice than some utilitarians: I will cooperate in a twin prisoner’s dilemma!\r\n\r\n\r\nI am ontologically atheist, tropologically spiritual and theologically noncognitivist.\r\n\r\n\r\nI broadly align with the fundamentals of the rationalist, post-rationalist and effective altruist approaches. They are fonts of absolutely incredible ideas. That being said, I harbour quite severe doubts about the epistemic and social health of the movements themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nLists of Things\r\n(The purpose of these lists is to give a flavour. They're not intended to be exhaustive!)\r\nLiterature\r\nContemporary:\r\nMargaret Atwood; Hilary Mantel; Kazuo Ishiguro; Jorge Luis Borges; Ian McEwan; Haruki Murakami; Umberto Eco; Graham Greene; John le Carré.\r\nClassical:\r\nFyodor Dostoyevsky; George Eliot; Thomas Hardy; Jane Austen.\r\nMultigenerational civilizational fantasy and science fiction epics:\r\nThe Hainish Cycle; the Foundation series; A Canticle for Leibowitz; the Dune Series; A Song of Ice and Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time, ADHD made me a very slow reader. It wasn’t that I didn’t enjoy reading, but that I found it overly-exciting, and my mind would keep wandering off, stimulated by the ideas. In recent years, medication, audio books, and better mastery of my symptoms have helped a great deal, and I’ve started consuming a lot more. But this means there are many gaps that I would like to fill.\r\nNonfiction\r\nGodel, Escher, Bach; The Selfish Gene; Thinking Fast and Slow; Capital in the 21st Century; Seeing Like a State; Mathematical Games by Martin Gardner; Physics textbooks by David Griffiths, James Binney or James Blundel.\r\nMusic\r\nClassical\r\nMozart; Beethoven; Bach; Sibelius; Janáček; Tchaikovsky; Bruckner; Mahler; Wagner (yes); Howells; Mendelssohn; Schubert; Prokofiev; Rachmaninov; Rimsky-Korsakov; Dvorak; Khachaturian; Byrd; Tallis; Pärt; Poulenc; Pergolesi.\r\nSymphonic/Power/Folk Metal\r\nNightwish; Turisas; Sabaton; Blind Guardian; Helion Prime; Dragonforce.\r\nMiscellanea\r\nA lot of jazz and related genres: Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis. Sometimes I become temporarily fascinated by other particular genres of music: classical Hindustani ragas, maqam, klezmer, isochronic tones, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to play clarinet, violin and trumpet, and I did choral singing for a while. To my eternal shame, I haven’t kept up with these. But music remains extremely important to me, somewhere close to my soul.\r\nVideo Games\r\nI play Age of Empires II online regularly with a group of friends (Elo ~ 1400 #humblebrag). Other games I enjoy or have enjoyed include:\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Victoria; the Civilization Series; Cities Skylines; Rimworld; Factorio; Open TTD; Disco Elysium; Pentiment; the Baldur’s Gate series; Planescape Torment; Monkey Island; Grim Fandango; Chrono Trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to go through long periods of not playing any games. But when my mental reserves run to zero, sometimes some part of my brain rebels, and I become fixated on a game for a little while, before I recover.\r\nFilms\r\nI don’t watch many. Some that I enjoy include: \r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty; anything by Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli; Pan's Labyrinth; Schindler's List.\r\nBroadcast media\r\nI don’t consume very much broadcast media.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarl Sagan's Cosmos; documentaries by Adam Curtis; Bryan Magee's wonderful interviews; most things on BBC Radio 4.\r\nYoutube Channels\r\n3Blue1Brown; PBS Spacetime; Kurzgesagt; CGP Grey; Maiorianus; Voices of the Past.\r\nBlogs\r\nAzimuth; Astral Codex Ten; A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry; Stumbling and Mumbling; Mainly Macro; Noapinion; Shtetl-Optimized; whatever Wolfram is doing; Chartbook; Age of Invention; Scientific Discovery.\r\nFood\r\nI am almost entirely vegan and strictly vegetarian. Beyond that, I am fairly flexible. Some of my favourite foods include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Chocolate.\r\nA Perfect Day\r\nIn the golden light of the dawn, I head to the gymnasium, its tall, firm Corinthian columns silhouetted against the morning sun. I debate with the other great philosophers as we watch the naked male youths wrestle in the palaestra. Their lithe forms glisten with perspiration, as they dance in tandem, mind and body in exquisite harmony. With the day's exertion done, I wander back to my oikos, where I am hosting a symposium, with all the foremost intelligentsia of the polis. We discuss the great unsolved mysteries of life, the Universe and everything, tiring away the sun with our talk. Finally, with our rhytons drained, the guests wander out into the evening's lengthening shadows. I fall into the smooth, strong curves of my beloved Antinous, resting my head against his slender — yet exquisitely toned — chest, and drift into the embrace of the still midnight... sorry, what were you asking again?\r\nContact Details\r\nSo you’ve read everything up to here (well OK maybe not everything…). And you want to get in touch? Are you sure about that?\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Yes, now give me the contact details!”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be friends or date, or something related, you can email me at:\r\ndafidius [AT] gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like receiving messages from people. (Even if I don’t reply, I genuinely promise that I almost certainly enjoyed receiving your message! I have never received a response to this profile that I didn’t enjoy reading.) I’m very shy so you should probably message me first. But if you really don’t know what to write, you could just send a link to your own dating profile, thereby putting the onus on me.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find my manifold.love profile here.\r\nYou can also find my OKCupid profile here.\r\nAll my dating profiles (including this catastrophe of a date-me page) should be regarded as being “under construction”.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can add me as a friend on facebook here, although I don’t use the site very actively.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you really want, you can see my academic website here. However, if possible, try not to send dating messages to my academic email addresses! [Warning: very out of date. I really need to update it, but I hate doing so.]\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Obviously I don’t want to message you! Someone like you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might want to investigate these lists of dating profiles, which have a relatively high density of people I find interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n* “I don’t want to date or even be friends, but I really need you to read my 30,000 page THEORY OF EVERYTHING, explaining why Einstein Was Wrong and the Physics Establishment are suppressing my revolutionary ideas!”\r\n\r\nThe best way to get my attention is to email that to my special email address here. And I promise to get back to you just as soon as I’ve finished reading your theory…\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Actually, I don’t want to contact you at all…”\r\n\r\nProbably a good decision! You have gained 200 XP."

      "fullText": "﻿Jay Geis\r\nThe Golden Knight\r\nEmail: jjgoldenknight@gmail.com\r\nTwitter: @JayGeisGold\r\nSteam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ReturnoftheKnight/\r\nMy creed: Nobility, Heroism, Preeminence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people don't have the attention span for a book, so I'll try to keep this comparatively brief; to further assist, paragraphs are organized in order of importance (most important at top). My personality is best described as energetic, enthusiastic, rational, daring, and brave (exactly what you imagine when you think of the word “KNIGHT”). Mom describes me as “lively and loud”, and I appreciate someone who is very direct with me. I am a straight white male, 31 years old, with a thin build, and I'm attracted to natural beauty and inner strength, someone who's smart, cute, and tough. Don't lather your body with paints or inks or perfumes or piercings, stay away from smoking and drugs, show me a steadfast determination, and through that you'll have a solid first impression. Fortune favors the bold; be bold.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a reputation for a fighting spirit, with steely resilience against obstacles and an attitude that's quick to ask, \"What do you expect me to DO about it\". My primary interests involve martial arts, hunting, and video games that involve intense violence, meaning my fighting spirit can also be taken more literally; in the correct context, I do enjoy a fight. All themes say I am, figuratively, an absolute hawk, and I very much want someone who compliments that with natural synergy. This means that, so long as I'm by your side, you'll never have to worry about a dark creepy alleyway ever again (unless you specifically enjoy that sort of situation, in which case I'll accommodate you every step of the way).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's important to me is finding a female partner and equal, not a pet. I do mean that both figuratively (i.e. not submissive or dominant, also not passive) and literally (i.e. I don't like cats, dogs, those kinds of pets). And I need someone who's able and willing to continue my biological legacy, so until genetic engineering becomes real, there's only one way to do that: old-fashioned penis-in-vagina sex. Between that and my hypersexual libido with sexual activity (including masturbation) measured on a daily scale, there's no getting around it: no sex, no partner. There's more to an intimate relationship than sex, but it is an essential element for me. Similarly, the most effective way to show you love me is by touch: hugging, rubbing, cuddling, tickling, and obviously sex are the most notable examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality compatibility is the difference between playmates and partners! I'd be satisfied having simple playmates for casual sex, but I still crave more; I want and need a truly intimate bond. If we end up being able to strike up compelling and thought-provoking conversation more times than not, that's absolutely a good sign. If it can be helped, don't respond with a couple words or a single sentence, try aiming for a paragraph or two. Give me something that'll make me think! And give me something that shows YOU are thinking! Good conversation is like Tennis: there's back-and-forth, each next reply building off the last answer. Ironic since I'm not a fan of the ball sports, but that's beside the point.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as what I fantasize about you as a person, I'm absolutely not picky about your body type or build (skinny, plump, average, Amazonian, or built like a mattress, none of that matters to me), and I'm not even very picky about the skin color (though white is preferred; I am white and do want white kids, but if it can't be helped, then it can't be helped; any legacy's better than nothing). In pure fantasy limited only by imagination, I'm attracted to masochism; I'm a known sadist who enjoys acute physical pain upon a cute female (i.e. biting, stinging, scratching, mild burning sensations, the list covers almost all magnitudes). I don't blame you if that scares you off, but if you get excited from the idea of playacting \"Brave Wilderness: GIRL EDITION\", there will be many racy adventures begging for us to explore!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, I wouldn’t necessarily mind being a stepdad, just make sure the kid wouldn’t mind having a half-brother or half-sister. That said, right now I’m not sure I’m yet in a position to settle with a family as I’m still living like a teenager and I’m stuck so long as the work-life balance is pending. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think that's enough to get started. There's more to say, but I've been told it's best to leave some mystery left for you to find out. In short, I romanticize the ideal of “two halves to a whole”, like I’m seeking my other half. Let me know what you think, because the only wrong answer is [no answer]."

I think I’m pretty cool.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Tara and I’m a former TV exec turned author turned…Idk, I just really want to remind people of their self-worth. That has become my job and it’s truly a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for someone KIND, thoughtful, affectionate, smart, passionate about something (maybe me?), spiritual, with a great sense of humor and a willingness to evolve and change. Oh, and be playful! Bonus points if you’re Jewish but not a deal breaker :) My favorite thing is to learn and I hope you teach me a lot. Also. I can let loose. A trip to Vegas is always in the cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am oddly obsessed with Formula 1 Racing. Monte Carlo, anyone?!\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in Los Angeles and am seriously contemplating a move to the Bay Area. Why? I need trees!!!!! I also need to date people who don’t work in Hollywood. I want a smarty-pants-nerd affection-dream who loves to be active, get out into nature, but is equally comfortable in Zion as they are at an Oscars party (which - I don’t get invited to anymore, buyer beware). All about the high-low, yin-yang. \r\n\r\n\r\nKids? I need the partner first! Growing up was not fun for me and so I want to make sure my partner and I are evolved enough and in love enough to bring new souls into the world. So, I’m open to kids but I need the guy first. Maybe it’s you? Idk. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope it’s you because I have a lot of love to give someone special :) AWWWW\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI have really good skin and you can email me at Tara.Schuster@gmail.com and this is my IG: https://www.instagram.com/taraschuster/?hl=en"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\nYou’re almost there — sign up to start building in Notion today.\nSign up or login\n🦆\nDate Kaushik Donthi (Me)\nShare\n🦆\nDate Kaushik Donthi (Me)\nTable of contents\nProblem statement\nGoals\nNon-goals\nProposed solution\nInterests and Hobbies\nValues\nPictures\nSuccess Criteria\nImplementation and rollout plan\nProblem statement\nI decided to use one of the Engineering solution templates from Notion, so my problem is figuring out how to use this without making people think I need a group of overpaid college graduates to fix me.\nBut really, my goal is to find a loving, rewarding relationship with a female I am interested in and for whom I am willing to sacrifice the time necessary to build a relationship. Someone who is kind, intelligent, silly, curious, courageous, and empathetic. And very importantly, someone who is emotionally mature enough to realize the kind of work and sacrifices that a relationship entails.\nI am pretty flexible about the actual location, since my job is usually remote. Buttt I am a sucker for good weather - I’ve lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and in Malaga, Spain for a little bit so I am not going to pretend that living in Norway would be perfect for me. But love transcends all, right? 😛 I’ll try to use some of the existing fields in this template that I find are surprisingly appropriate or just funny.\nGoals\nIdeally - find someone who is compatible with me in a relationship sense by showing them this document and some pictures of me, at which point they will fall hopelessly in love.\nNon-goals\nMeeting more guys. Just kidding! If you think we would be two cubes in an ice tray, regardless of what your gender is, then totally message me and we can haaanggg. See “Implementation and Rollout Plan” for contact details.\nProposed solution\nMeet a lot more girls with the openness to a relationship or just a friendship depending on how we feel about each other. I see either as a win, but I want to be clear that my intention going into a meeting is 80% to date and 20% to be friends. To be clear, I love having a relationship that has the foundation of a friendship. But I am not sure how this is possible unless we read this doc, signed a binding contract to be friends, erased our memories, and then one day felt that we could be more.\nI think it’s easier going from “Ah I don’t see this working out as a relationship, but we can totally drink boba like every 5 weeks” rather than “Hey we drink boba like every 5 weeks, but I want to see you again tomorrow.”\nInterests and Hobbies\nProgramming - I am a software engineer who has worked for blockchain companies (trading and gaming-related) and I am extremely grateful that I truly enjoy my work! I love building things with an end customer in mind and I find it awesome that solving cool problems can make peoples’ lives better. Somehow, I think the universe was beautifully designed that way.\nMath/Physics\nI kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world\nI have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation\nI used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\nStrategy Games\nReally Like\nCatan (I love the 1v1 version of Colonist, I was ranked Diamond two seasons ago and btw the username is from Looking for Alaska by John Green haha)\nSecret Hitler\nSoccer\nLove/Hate\nChess\nTennis (love watching it though)\nHate\nUno (is this even strategy?)\nLosing (in honesty, I can get pretty competitive sometimes haha)\nBeing active\nRunning\nSwimming Way Too Deep in the Ocean (SWTDO)\nRowing\nComedy\nImprov (for me, humor compatibility in a relationship is huge and if I can do a bit with you, that is a huge plus)\nConan O’Brien <3\nValues\nHonesty\nI am the kind of person who tries to say what is on his mind in a compassionate, caring way towards myself and others\nI think short-term discomfort is worth long-term growth\nI really resonate with the quote from the Kite Runner, “That's the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.” It just means to me that if we both trust ourselves to be honest, we can assume good intention and it just makes things soooooo much easier (and we can also move much faster haha!)\nGentleness/Kindness\nI don’t feel like a man needs to be “assertive” or “dominant”; I think being gentle and kind is strong in it’s own way\nI think being kind and loving and holding someone’s heart with care are so much more important and I want to be with someone who values the care I give to them\nFighting Well\nI think in a relationship fights are inevitable, but I think healthy relationships fight well\nPhysical violence is not okay, as are demeaning comments\nWe try to argue our points to the best of our knowledge and acknowledge good points from the other side\nWe are both mentally healthy enough that we do our best to make it work but have the power to walk away at any time\nHealth\nI have become much healthier over the last 7 or 8 years and I would love to meet someone who also cares about what they put in their body\nI love to exercise on a regular basis, whether it is swimming, running, rowing, or playing soccer\nI don’t expect my partner to be interested in the same activities (I guess this goes for really everything I’ve said so far haha)\nAlso pretty into meditation, although my view on its importance has changed a lot over the past few years\nSelfish Altruism with a Mix of Loving Without Expectation\nI think it is important to figure out what brings you joy and how you can use that to bring joy to others\nBare altruism is rarely a good long-term goal - how many vegetarians/vegans have you met who did it for the sake of the world but gave up because of how futile they felt their attempts were in making a dent in the animal consumption problem?\nFor me, becoming almost fully vegetarian/vegan was a decision inspired by my getting healthier and looking better\nBut I think loving yourself allows you to love others best :); and loving without expectation is the best way to show up in life and in a relationship - that love doesn’t have any promises; you just have to be grateful for every moment, and enjoy every single moment\nCuriosity/Playfulness\nI love being just fun and silly and weird and my humor can be dirty sometimes with people I feel comfortable with, and I hope to find someone I can play with for the rest of my life\nI think that the universe is somehow inherently playful - it does without any purpose and it rewards joy and spreading happiness\nI think everything is connected from chess to physics to swimming to flowers and I love to find and think about these connections\nBelief/Confidence/Ambition\nI truly believe that the universe works with you on goals you really believe in and that the universe responds when you ask it for something and put a full-hearted effort into it\nI think working towards goals that ignite us is what we live for and it’s important to me that my partner is decently ambitious as well\nPhysical Connection\nPhysical touch is one of my love languages, so I would ideally like to be with someone who also likes that :)\nI think sex to me is a part of expressing love in a relationship, and while it shouldn’t be at the forefront of what’s going on, I think it’s important that there is good physical compatibility\nI don’t think about sex that much at all, unfortunately, so I can tend to be bad at initiating; however, this is something I am happy to work on\nPictures\nAnd here are some (silly) pictures of me! I guess if I had to describe myself, I am a 5’ 10.5’’ guy who tends to be kind of skinnier/toned side. A lot of these are in Europe (I lived in Spain for a bit last year!) and I switch a lot between having and not having a beard, so I’ll include pictures of both 🙂\nI didn’t even get to go to the top :,) But maybe we can?\nALT\nYeah I guess you could say I get a lot of kudos\nALT\nWhat’s up with my posture lmao\nALT\nDon’t show this to my mom (I’m a momma’s boy if you couldn’t tell)\nALT\nJust for balance, a picture my mom probably likes\nALT\nSuccess Criteria\nHow will you validate the solution is working correctly?\nHopefully, we can be very open with each other if we think things are working out. I am sometimes really good but otherwise hopelessly lost in reading signs from girls.\nI also don’t want to waste either of our time - I think a relationship is an opportunity cost and I hope that we are both gaining something from our time together to make up for it.\nWhat monitoring and alerting will you do to ensure this project doesn’t decrease performance and reliability?\nI will constantly ask ChatGPT 4.5 to tell me what I am doing wrong\nImplementation and rollout plan\nIf you read all that and you think you still want to meet me, I guess maybe you’re pretty cool yourself.\nHaha, did you actually fall for this big pile of steaming …? Okay sorry, like I said my humor can be a bit strange sometimes. Hopefully, you didn’t actually stop reading. Or if everyone stopped reading, would anyone ever read this? I wonder if I could just write whatever I wanted down here. Like YO MAMMA IS SO FAT, THAT SHE GOES THROUGH A LUNAR CYCLE EVERY TIME SHE PIROUETTES. Who said my jokes were good?\nJeez, okay… I will try to be serious for like 20 seconds. If you think we would be a good fit, text me at (plus one) five one zero, seven seven one, four nine one four. Or email me at kaushikdr@gmail.com. Or do both?"

      "fullText": "﻿Why should I date Watson?            \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral info\r\nHi, I’m Watson. I’ve lived  in Emeryville California and environs for a decade but I come from New Jersey.  I studied math at Chicago (class of 2013) and at Berkeley (graduated 2018).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specific info\r\nLooking for a long term nesting partner of any gender. I am a poly, kinky, switch, bisexual cis man open to having or adopting children.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen asked to give three words about me my long-term partner said “effusive, kind, gentle”. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpend a day with Watson\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently I work from home. My work life balance is good. In the evenings I like to practice my ukulele, ride my bike, or watch a classic film at the Roxie.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve had the good fortune to have gone sailing with my father a bunch of times: including across the Pacific. I like to hike everything from evening walks in Claremont Canyon to multi day traverses of mountain ranges. I enjoy skiing at Kirkwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sometimes go to science fiction conventions where I sing and play the ukulele, and sometimes perform my own songs or do covers of classic filk songs (Filk is the folk music of science fiction fandom)\r\n\r\n\r\nI read really fast because I’m autistic and hyperlexic. I like to discuss literature and films and spend too much time on the Internet. I also play a lot of board games and DM my own D&D campaign.\r\nWho you are\r\nYou are open-minded and supportive, creative, and caring. You are willing to take the time to get on the same wavelength, and you enjoy beautiful places, art, music, literature and terrible puns.\r\nWhy shouldn’t I date Watson?\r\nReligion, sex, and politics\r\nReligion: I’m Jewish and it’s very important to me. I go to a synagogue on many Friday nights, and aspire to learn to read Torah and Aramaic to study Talmud. I don’t keep Shabbat, or kosher, and I am willing to touch people of other genders. I am mostly a cultural Jew but I do like to be active in my local Jewish community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSex: I am bisexual, poly, kinky, and switchy, 40/60 top/bottom. Very dependent on dynamic: some have leaned more one side than the other. I love rope and impact play. I would love to expand my skill set and am open to going to events and classes together.\r\n\r\nPolitics: I’m a right Heglian now, after a misspent youth pursuing Trotskyism in the form of Postonian Freudo-Marxism. A far cry from the logical atomism someone said I radiated early in my college career. I vote democratic and am involved in local YIMBY (yes in my backyard) activism.\r\nMental health\r\nI am more motivated to do things when my friends or partners are involved. I have a lot of inertia towards projects or plans that only involve myself. Nevertheless when I have the energy I’ll happily go out and plot adventures for a whole group of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can react strongly, especially when things are going wrong, as well as find it hard to ask for help and sometimes beat myself up.. The best way to snap me out of it is to be kind to me and offer a hug.\r\nPhysical health\r\nI have a rare genetic disorder that makes small bumps on my face and scalp. If you zoom in on the photos you can see them. They are harmless and easily treated. I am also very tall (6’ 4”) I enjoy weight lifting and biking. I am happy to reach things on high shelves.\r\nOther relationships\r\nI have a long distance partner I’m emotionally close to and visit several times a year for a week or so at a time. She also visits me. I date two other people at irregular intervals and have been for a long time.\r\nLocation\r\nI live in paradise (Northern California) , and see no reason to change it.\r\nHow to find Watson\r\nMy email is watsonbladd@gmail.com, or text me at 201-213-9379, FB messenger or Signal work better than email: my inbox is often crowded.\r\n\r\nIf I don’t respond, please text again. I want to hear from you."

I don’t want to have kids—open to trying out being with someone who already has them, though. Not interested in dating people outside of the SF Bay Area, i.e. starting to get to know each other only virtually.\r\nI work in operations and finance, currently (and for 9 years) at Animal Charity Evaluators. Was previously a software and applications engineer.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     \r\nThese are from Nov 2020 (sea lions!), May 2022, June 2022 (climbing), Oct 2022 (staff retreat in D.C.), and June 2023 (trip to Mendocino, CA), in that order. There are more pictures on Facebook.\r\nMore Details\r\nPeople close to me have recognized that I’m especially: (i) curious—about people and ideas, “gearsy thinking”, one called it, (ii) literal, (iii) trustworthy—I generally do what I say I will, and (iv) caring. So if you’re a very private person or need me to get all your meta-messages, it probs won’t work out. Myers-Briggs (but from almost a decade ago): ISTJ\r\nWhat’s most important to me; unlikely to change:\r\n* Involvement in effective altruism (since 2013)\r\n* Involvement in animal advocacy (since 2011)\r\n* Getting outside quite frequently\r\n* Staying relatively healthy, e.g. through regular exercise, decent diet, and taking mental health seriously\r\n* Seeing friends and family\r\n* Cryonics\r\n* Non-religious\r\n* Making lists :)\r\nSome current hobbies and interests:\r\n* Climbing indoors and outdoors, hiking, tennis\r\n* Singing\r\n* Variety of social events: games, parties, small gatherings, hosting themed dinners\r\n* Travel, especially to a new country once or twice a year\r\n* Podcasts, articles, books on psychology, economics, critical thinking, rationality\r\nWhat I Want in Relationships\r\nI’m mostly looking for a long-term primary partner, but would start any relationship out casually/see if we get along as friends. I’m also open to shorter-term and/or less serious dating.[1] I’ll describe what I’d like for each type of relationship in the sections below.\r\nPrimary Partner\r\nThis is what I’d like to be heading toward eventually, though some pieces (like values alignment) are more likely to be there from the start.\r\nValues alignment: I’d like a long-term partnership where we are quite aligned on values like effective altruism, and where we’re both working on something that is expected to be pretty high-impact.\r\nLove, support/growth: We would support each other emotionally, and also actively encourage and support each other in reaching our goals to become happier, stronger, better people living in alignment with our values. We would have a lot of love and care for each other, and show our love physically, through words, and by spending time together (and maybe other ways!). We’d celebrate each others’ joys and be there to support each other during tough times.\r\nCommunication: We would be honest, open, and have meta discussions about our relationship and ways we can improve it. Giving and receiving feedback can be stressful, but we would learn how best to communicate critical feedback in ways that lessens or eliminates the hurt the other person feels (which could be specific to the person).\r\nCommitment, security: In a serious relationship, we’re both really willing to put in work to keep the relationship good, or to work through a set back, whether it be about the relationship or one of our own struggles. We would share what we need from each other in order to feel secure in our relationship. Even little things (like appreciating time spent together) can make a big difference.\r\nIn tune, emotionally aware: We would stay updated on what is going on in each other’s lives, e.g. so that we can proactively support each other. We would notice and be able to read each other’s emotions to an increasing extent, and respond appropriately.\r\nLogistics: I’d like to live together with a primary partner, and I currently like living in the SF Bay Area. I don’t want kids. I’d really like it if we didn’t have meat or eggs in our place.[2] \r\nSome preferred activities:\r\n* Cuddle ~daily\r\n* Exercise together weekly or more\r\n* Travel together (especially places where we can see wildlife)\r\n* Try out new activities together\r\n* Discuss interesting things we’ve read/learned\r\n* Work on an intellectually-stimulating project together\r\n* Do stuff with friends together\r\nLikes in a partner:\r\n* Has at least some experience with long-term relationships (my two longest: over fifteen years and about four years)\r\n* Working on something you believe is really important for improving the world\r\n* Vegan\r\n* 27–48 years old (though this isn’t a strict range)\r\n* Has some interests/activities in common\r\n* Attempts to live relatively healthy\r\n🚩Red flags for primary partners 🚩:\r\n* Smoking cigarettes\r\n* Strong belief in pseudoscience things like astrology and healing from crystals\r\n* Wanting to keep gun(s) at our place (if we lived together)\r\n* Often being easily agitated or aggressive\r\nShorter-term and/or Less Serious Dating\r\nI’m also open to less serious dating, and don’t need as much alignment with people I date less seriously. Just communicate about what sort(s) of relationships you want, if you know :) \r\nConnect With Me\r\nIf you’d like to get to know me better or just have something to say to me after reading this, feel free to Facebook message me or text/WhatsApp/Signal at +1 608-446-2243.\r\nShare With Someone\r\nLink to share easily: bit.ly/dategina \r\n________________\r\n[1] Also, what I want may change! I could meet someone great who has in mind a different type of relationship, and I might be open to exploring that with them. I’ve learned from past partners and my own experience that people often don’t know exactly what they want.\r\n[2] With the exception of cat food, until I can buy cell-cultured meat for her."

      "fullText": "﻿Hi, I am Jess 😁\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad you found your way to my date-me.doc. Sit back, relax, and let me take you on this journey that is me! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe basics: \r\nAge: 38\r\nHeight: 5’3”\r\nLocation: Manhattan, NYC\r\nBuild: Fit leaning Curvy (I am a Latina 🙂)\r\nHair: Red-ish\r\nEyes: Green\r\nEducation: BA in International Relations, Masters in International Business\r\nJob: Senior Program Manager at a famous tech company\r\nLooking for: a monogamous relationship with a (straight or heteroflexible) men\r\nRelationship stats: Never married, looking for a serious long-term relationship (hopefully marriage)\r\nKids: None. I don’t want any, however, it will not be a deal breaker if you have them - as long as you are a good dad!\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, hey, here is a quick visual!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you still with me? Great! Let’s get into more details!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things you will ask me on a first date:\r\nI was born and raised in Brazil and left in 2010 to get my master's degree. Since then I have lived in 4 countries, traveled to 76, and have been in New York City since 2016. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I travel a lot - mostly for fun. I am fascinated by history and always want to learn more and different things, that is why I try to avoid repeating destinations. I am a proud owner of three driver's licenses, two citizenships, and one permanent residency card - you will need your own TSA-Pre, Global Entry and Clear to join me!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut don’t worry, I own my apartment so I don’t plan to pick up and leave the city anytime soon (my friends made me pinky promise, so you know it is serious). \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is what I like doing for fun: pilates, going to Broadway shows, museums, concerts, trying new restaurants and bars, drinking Champagne (I am a certified expert) and going out to dance. I also need some downtime, where I mostly spend my time reading books (romances) and TV shows (mostly heartwarming/fun stuff).\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very career driven and I want a partner that understands and supports that. It is important to me that you are passionate and ambitious about something that matters to you. I am also a woman, Latina and immigrant, so I am very liberal and a feminist, and you will have to be too. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am alcohol friendly and I am ok with any other pastimes (420, Cigars etc) - if you do them only once in a while. On a somewhat related topic, I like my men like I like my ice cream - not vanilla. 😉\r\n\r\n\r\nNow a word from my sponsors (aka my friends who I asked to write this): \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom C (knows me for 10 years): My first impression of Jessica was that she is very confident, ambitious, and bad-ass and while all of those things are very true, she’s also one of the most loyal, kind, empathetic and thoughtful people I know. If she loves you, she loves you at your best and your worst, she boosts you up when you f*ck up - and helps you see through the clouds when you feel gloomy. She will give to you, so make sure you do the same for her. Bonus points if you have a doggo she can dote on too. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom K (knows me for 7 years): Thank you C, I wholeheartedly second everything you said! <3 Jess also brings an incredible sense of adventure and sparkle to everything she does. Whether it’s a night in or a grand holiday, she is always fully engaged in the present - learning the traditional custom here, exploring a developing interest there, or giving you her full attention when you need a shoulder. She has the most incredible heart for service and truly cares about making those around her feel seen, cared for, and valued. This woman is a rare find. Trust me gents, she is the one!     \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a partner (yay - that might be you!)\r\nYou are consistent, respectful and reliable. You are happy on your own and are looking for a partner that will add to your life. You want a serious relationship and potentially see yourself getting married. You have a good job with career progression, have disposable income for 2+ international trips a year, and live by yourself. You want someone to plan your vacations for you so you just show up with your passport and credit cards to the airport. You live in NYC, or are willing to relocate here. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I get in contact with you?\r\nI would love for you to reach out to me via this form. I promise to get back to you! \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here are some more pictures!!!"

Here are some basic things about me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’m a man seeking a woman\r\n* I’m monogamous\r\n* I live in the Seattle metro\r\n* I’m 25 years old\r\n* I work as a software engineer\r\n* I’m 5’7”\r\n* I look like this:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHere are some things I like to do:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I really like tabletop games. I host or attend “game nights” of some kind 1-2 times per week on average. What I really like about games is that they’re a great way to have social experiences that are different than what I would otherwise have and connect with people, and they’re also a problem-solving exercise in a way. I especially like social deduction games such as Avalon.\r\n* I like (indoor) rock climbing. The combination of physical exertion with a mental puzzle is fun.\r\n* I like to read, think, and talk about interesting things. It’s hard to summarize what I find interesting but the blogs Astral Codex Ten and Wait But Why and the YouTube channels CGP Grey and Wendover Productions consistently capture it very well.\r\n* I like to have novel experiences. If I have the opportunity to try something I haven’t before, I usually take it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some other things about me: \r\n\r\n\r\n* I’m kind of shy at first. On the Myers-Briggs personality system I am INTJ.\r\n* I warm up to people slowly; if we were to date the first date or two would probably feel pretty close to being platonic because I would just want to get to know each other.\r\n* I want to have kids one day, but not for a while.\r\n* I have been in one relationship that lasted about a year and otherwise I don’t have much experience with dating. I am still trying to figure out how to do it well and who I am compatible with. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m hoping to meet a woman who is:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Age 22-28 (soft limit)\r\n* Open to the possibility of a long term relationship\r\n   * This is the ideal outcome from my point of view, but I won’t be disappointed if we end up dating short term or only being friends.\r\n* Close enough to Seattle to meet in person (I don’t want to start a relationship long-distance) \r\n* Kind and honest and interesting and intelligent and conscientious\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think there’s a chance we might be compatible and you’re interested in getting to know me, I would love to hear from you!

Photos are at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Stats\r\n* Male\r\n* 32 years old (Taurus)\r\n* 6’-0” tall\r\n* Grew up in central NJ → 4 yr in Upstate NY → 2 yr in IA → 3 yr in WA → 3 yr in CO → WA\r\n* Work in Mukilteo (30 min N of Seattle)\r\n* Raised Jewish, don’t currently associate with or practice religion\r\n* Liberal but also free-thinking and respect folks with other ideologies\r\n* Open to kids\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, I’m looking for\r\nA female monogamous life partner, who lives in, or frequents the Seattle area.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAbout You\r\nThis isn’t so much about me as it is you :) \r\nBelow are some ideas, not criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou feel a responsibility to make the world a better place socially or environmentally. Whether that be through application of business to tackle a problem, or are in policy, or at a non-profit, or through volunteerism, or are in the process of developing a plan to do so (I get that some folks want financial independence before dedicating themselves to the cause). This motivation is a key driver for you, and something that you consider often.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are self-aware and are comfortable talking about your feelings and communicating generally. Down to shoot me straight and provide feedback before something becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou like to cuddle. You are OK without significant PDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are active and think about health. You feel similarly that outdoor time and exercise are mentally grounding, and do these reguarly. You like to eat your veggies, and sometimes like to eat your wheaties (high-energy foods).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know what makes you happy, and pursue that. You can take genuine interest in a wide range of topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are a free-thinker, and have the ability to pull personal biases to the side to logically assess a perspective or situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAbout Me\r\nThe world is a beautiful place, and I want to learn how every aspect of it works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince middle school, I have been passionate about addressing environmental and ecological problems. My perspective on these problems and means of addressing them has evolved significantly over the past 15+ years.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time in motion outside, it is meditative / grounding / calming. Also like to push myself physically.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do enjoy planning, but often have analysis paralysis, so can be an inefficient decision maker. That said, I love tackling small challenges. For example: We’re about to have 20 people show up for this event in 2 hours but don’t any theme-relevant decorations, hors d'oeuvres, or any chairs for them to sit in.\r\n\r\n\r\nWear a bunch of hats at work - on paper am a program manager, but also a process engineer, construction PM, life-cycle assessment practitioner, manufacturing facility maintenance manager, site safety lead, and financial planner. Master of none. Sometimes struggle with work-life balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years I had legit hobbies: involvement the world of traditional teas, gardening and CSAs, permaculture, fruit tree and orchard management, gleaning, foraging and fruit exploring, but slowed these the past few years. I am in the process of re-exploring these and new ones, particularly with a service component.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of dating me\r\n* Emotionally available\r\n* Honest and upfront\r\n* Love to cook and clean\r\n* Will take interest in your hobbies\r\n* Have a lot of love to give\r\n* Like doing gross chores - happy to pull goop out of strainer, roto-root scuzz out of sink drain, and clean the toilet.\r\n* Will catch your spiders and bring them outside\r\n* Will bring snacks\r\n* I will tear it up on the dance floor with you\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll be putting up with\r\n* Someone who gets ants in their pants and needs to go outside or on a walk/bike/jog\r\n* Often overly logical - some things in life just don’t benefit from having logic applied to them\r\n* Good at thinking one step ahead - bad at thinking 2+ steps ahead\r\n* I’m better at giving than receiving\r\n* I eat a lot\r\n* Although I love cleaning, I tend to wait until there will be physical accomplishment from doing a cleaning activity\r\n* I may go too hard on the dancefloor\r\n________________\r\nPhotos\r\n  \r\n\r\nI love toasting - it’s a great challenge to concisely say something moving\r\n  \r\n\r\nHello! Yes, I snot in the winter months like a normal human\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFood is only waste if we waste it\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlpaca farm near Loveland, CO\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, I still have T-shirts from high-school hippie days\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLook, there’s another\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy sister and I at Mt.

I’m Ben. I’m kind-of leisurely seeking a life partner.\r\nBasic Stats\r\nAge\r\n\t32\r\n\tHeight\r\n\t5’11”\r\n\tWeight\r\n\t250lbs\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tBerkeley\r\n\tRelationship type\r\n\tSolo poly, but in the long run probably want something closer to monogamy\r\n\tGender\r\n\tCis man (tbh if “hacker” were a gender I’d probably be that instead)\r\n\tSexual Orientation\r\n\tAbout 90% straight; dominant. Have some kinks, and like exploring, but not a kink-essentialist. I am actively into / not-threatened-by intelligence and competence in partners. If I have a “type”, it’s probably slightly androgynous women.\r\n\tBasic personality / identity facts\r\n\tNon-dogmatic, open, kind, problem-solving-oriented and ~75th percentile neurotic. I think humanity is massively underprepared for AI, and am working on that.\r\n\tLinks\r\n\thttps://www.benwr.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/benwr\r\nhttps://superstimul.us/profile/ben \r\nhttps://forms.gle/kVk74rqzfMh4Q2SM6 (use ^this form^ to contact me if you don’t want to use facebook or twitter)\r\n\tAll other details (sex stuff, test scores, personality typing systems)\r\n\tAvailable on request (seriously; especially wrt sex stuff, I’m happy to share, just not in this doc)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nRight now, I’m fairly happy with my ~stereotypical bachelor-y life, but am feeling pretty ready to settle down if I can find the right person. I live in a rationalist group house with a bunch of cool people. I have two current partners; eventually, I hope to find myself in an extremely trusting / loving / comfortable romantic relationship, but I’m not in a huge hurry. My imagination paints this relationship as monogamous, but I’m not fundamentally opposed to polyamory in the long run (and in the short run I probably don’t want to jump straight into a monogamous partnership). I’d like to have kids, potentially soon if I meet the right person!\r\nSome personality traits are very important to me in a partner: compassion, open-mindedness, and general wholesomeness are almost prerequisites for me to want to date someone. It’s a huge bonus if you also want to talk about random intellectual bullshit.\r\nAbout me\r\nI often actively seek honest feedback from people, so I have a pretty good selection that you can peruse if you want. See Appendices A and B. My basic augmented summary:\r\n* I like making things, and I’m good at it\r\n* I’m like 99th+ percentile principled, kind, thoughtful, and sincere\r\n* I apologize too much, and focus too much on not-imposing on others, rather than on e.g. doing fun things. Relatedly, I am kind of persnickety, especially about where I spend social effort.\r\n* I’m a good teacher, and love nerding out about things. Sometimes I can go a bit overboard.\r\nI’d also add:\r\n* Since early 2022, when I was hospitalized for an infection, my health has been vaguely (but very annoyingly) bad. I’ve gained a lot of weight, had serious problems with my digestion, and have been tired all the time.\r\n   * Around the same time, I was diagnosed with depression (possibly related to the fatigue).\r\n   * This has been sporadically improving since about June 2023. I seem to have much more energy, and my digestive issues are now intermittent rather than constant.\r\n* I am very into good coffee shops.\r\nI currently don’t do illegal drugs, but not because I’m opposed to them; I hope to resume very occasionally using psychedelics in about two years. See Appendix C for details about this.\r\nCareer-wise, I’m focused on trying to ensure that humanity survives at least a few more decades. My background is in computer science and engineering, and I worked on self-driving cars and lab automation for genomics, before switching to trying to address risks to humanity from artificial intelligence, starting in 2017. Since then I’ve done lots of things; some AI-related and some aimed at biological risks. Right now I’m working at Palisade Research, on demonstrations of AI failures, and also as acting director of AI Impacts.\r\nSome random bragging\r\nI’m really good at writing code. I used to do it competitively in college. I also designed and wrote big chunks of the software that's running the Cruise self driving cars.\r\nIn 2020 I solved an open problem in distributed systems (related to how one would write a piece of software like Roam or Workflowy as a \"conflict-free replicated datatype\"). I haven't published it because writing up the proof would be more trouble than it's worth, but I did get confirmation from the leading guy in the subfield that my solution works.\r\nIn May 2023, in a fit of frustration, I invented the “whiskey cleanse”, which seems to have successfully solved my year-long serious digestive issues, which my doctor had been unable to solve.\r\nI’m pretty good at sex. Of eight sex partners, two have said that I was their favorite partner to date (both from pools of 7-10), and others have also given very positive feedback. One kink (sorta) that I will mention, is that I really like being especially competent, and ensuring that my partner is having a great time. I definitely don’t want to promise that we’d have great sex, since I haven’t really subjected this to any selection pressure before, and the kind of people who date me are, by definition, the kind of people who date weird nerds (who might in turn be unusually bad at sex). But I think my track record is pretty good, at least.\r\nAppendix A: Anonymous feedback\r\nSome anonymous feedback I’ve received in the last few years, via this feedback form:\r\n* I appreciate the sense of togetherness I feel when around you. It's like you're holding a certain kind of space for the world to just be as it is, and not to have to act according to a social script or put up a facade.On the flip side, I think you apologize too much. There are ways an apology can serve as a kind of shield that hides the acknowledgement of what happened. When you apologize I often feel most alone around you, like you've retreated into your shell.I'm glad you are who you are.\r\n* I think you underestimate how much people like you and how much they value your company.\r\n* Ben WR#... Engineering Type PokémonBens can be found in the area surrounding the San Francisco Bay.Strengths: * I really admire your dedication to your principles. You are dedicated even by the standard of effective altruists, which is impressive. There are ways in which you could be more dedicated, but this is still one of my favorite things about you. * I like the way you go about thinking about \"engineering\" type problems. You aren't afraid of the complexity the way I sometimes am, and are are even curious about it. * You are great at being a socratic duck.Weaknesses: * It seems like you've developed some scars after a rough time getting up to speed at MIRI. Adding more speculation to the already speculative armchair psychoanalysis, these scars hold you back from diving into to your work to the extent you did at Cruise. It's plausible that now's a good time to renew your attempts to resolve these scars.\r\n* great guy.\r\n* You are often an effective teacher with a good amount of patience.\r\nAppendix B: Anonymized feedback from people who know me especially well\r\nI ran a birthday “dooms & destinies” conversation on chathamroom.com (a web site I made) for my 31st birthday, in late November 2022. I invited the 15 people who know me best (apart from my family), including 2 ex-partners and 1 current partner, to contribute any thoughts or advice they had for me (without revealing which of the 15 said what). Here are most of the things they said (leaving out some that don’t make sense without more context):\r\n* You are easy for me to feel warmly toward, and to care about, and to expect care from, and to expect to have be able to care about other people. I think this is really great. It seems kinda rare among my friends, or among Berkeley people.\r\n* You are an attentive and sincere and intelligent conversation partner, and talking to you is in a nice way like talking to myself, more than for most people. It's probably important that you are reasonable and I trust your judgment a lot. And also that I think you rarely misunderstand me. It feels like we can talk with a lot of precision.\r\n* You don't work with imperfection well. It seems like you need to fix imperfections that somehow shouldn't bother you… [On the other hand,] You don't pretend that things are perfect when they're not. You don't accept things are good when they don't seem so to you. You believe in concrete paths forward to better things that you, personally, could start on today\r\n* You seem to want to trade or commensurate in an unusual way when it comes to human relationships. Like, \"I don't want to do X when talking to people. But it seems like I should be able to do Y instead [in conversation or elsewhere in life] and still get Z??\". I don't know if this possible, but it seems like it's not working for most Z\r\n* You are kind. It seems like your kindness goes first to the rejected and ashamed. You are not a fair-weather friend.\r\n   * +1. I also appreciate this about you.\r\n   * Yes, I would never worry that Ben would not want to hang out with me/care for me because I 'became less cool' or was depressed or something, he feels very dependable and loyal.\r\n*  you are good at making things! This is great.\r\n   * Relatedly, you are good at imagining the world in ways that it is not, and thinking them through, and good to talk to re this.\r\n* you have a kind of trust in your own ability to do things that I admire, and that I wish more people had. This is probably related to the person who said \"you are good at making things!\". In me it sits as a kind of self-trust, and I admire it and see it as a source of strength and grounding.\r\n   * +1 because I think this actually rubbed off on me some when we were working on something together and it's been a net positive in other parts of my life.\r\n   *   Yes I like this a lot about Ben. And in particular I think you do this in a way that doesn't make other people feel inferior/inadequate, you're being competent very much for yourself rather than performatively\r\n   *   I also find it both adorable and inspirational how much you are excited and nerdy about making and solving and building things\r\n* I think you tend to over-identify with things? With certain groups of people and identities but also with specific behaviors and struggles in a way that can be self-fulfillling\r\n* You decline a lot of invitations, but ask that you still be invited to the next thing, because you are actually interested but something is going on. This only works for so long. Ive seen people stop inviting you despite the requests because it gets old. As a destiny, which you do actually show up, you are a lot of fun to be around.\r\n   * my sense is that you get a lot out of being with other people (i.e. are not fundamentally a loner type person, at least in ways) but are often relatively alone because specific opportunities are bad in ways. But you then don't often cause social things yourself that would be good. My guess is that doing so is costly and not immediately worth it, but I wonder if it would lead to a better overall part of the landscape if you got an affordance for it.\r\n* I think Ben is very broadly likable. I don't recall hearing of a person saying they have negative sentiment toward him in general, and people often seem to have positive sentiment.\r\n   *   Yes, I think Ben is broadly regarded as a sweetheart and very nice to have around\r\n* I appreciate how much integrity you have\r\n* You're very generous with your time and efforts - I really appreciate times you've e.g. helped drive me to places, helped me solve technical problems, etc\r\n* You have too many preferences and/or pay too much attention to small preferences; on the margin, I think you should prioritize 'being ok with a wider range of things; learning to ignore annoyances or appreciate different kinds of things' over 'changing things to suit your preferences'. I can try to think of examples if that's unclear as it is.\r\n* You are a great teacher. I think this is a related to other destinies of groundedness about your competence, intrinsic interest in doing things, patience and gentleness and attentiveness with other people. You are very good at explaining things, sharing interest and excitement about them, not making the recipient feel dumb for not knowing stuff already, making it feel easy to ask questions, providing positive reinforcement for sharing confusion and questions, making people feel like a good student. It seems like you also enjoy teaching. I think this is an asset in life in general even if you don't make it an explicit part of your career, but I think you could consider trying to take advantage of this even more.\r\n* You score the highest of almost anyone I know on some kind of social attentiveness to imposition/inconvenience/asking things of people. This makes you very considerate and sweet, but I think it can also cause unnecessary suffering for you and others. I do think the underlying trait is definitely an asset, but you can probably shape it into something that involves less negative affect… almost all of your apologizing is for things where there isn't anything in particular I would have wanted you to do differently). I don't think this is hugely important - I see this overall thing as an endearing trait that's part of what makes you such a sweetheart, but seems like it causes you a bit more pain than is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix C: Why I temporarily don’t do drugs\r\nI want life insurance, in order to sign up for cryonics. I refused to lie on the application, despite my insurance agent’s preference that I do so. I learned that if you’ve done any illegal drugs other than marijuana in the last five years, and are stupid/stubborn enough to tell them so on the application, they just will not insure you no matter what. So I’m now about three years through a five-year drug-free period.\r\nI’ve written a bit about my approach to honesty, which results in my unwillingness to lie to the insurance company."

      "fullText": "﻿Ryan’s Dating Profile!\r\n\r\n\r\nDating profile? What’s up with this- why not just use the apps? \r\n\r\n\r\nI noticed lots of people I follow on Twitter were making these. Yes, I know it’s a bit awkward to read (imagine how awkward it was to write!), but let’s lean into that! I think it seems like an interesting way to share more information than is typically permitted by dating apps. \r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter user @chanamessinger has started a twitter thread with a number of examples, and @FerrisHueller wrote about the merits of similar documents.\r\ntl;dr\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRyan McGuine\r\n\r\n\r\nAge: 30\r\nHeight: 6’0”\r\nGender: Male\r\nLocation: Currently Kansas City, MO\r\nMonogamy?: Yes \r\nWants kids?: Definitely, within the next 5 years \r\nLooking for: Eventually something serious and long-term; uninterested in aimless casual fun, but not rushing into something\r\nAbout you\r\nNot “requirements”, but the items below are very strong pluses for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional ambition: Not in a “optimize all of life for success at work” manner, but in a “having a growth mindset while doing the thing we spend most of our waking hours doing is rewarding” manner. \r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical activity: I’m physically fit, which I value both for the associated mental clarity and emotional wellbeing, as well as the ability to carry out functional tasks elsewhere in life. I prefer the same in a partner. \r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial wellbeing: If I cloned my financial situation, I could comfortably afford a house and children. It’s not important to me that you meet or exceed my finances precisely, but would like to be building toward those things together.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalmness and stability: You can take on practical tasks and have a reasonable ability to regulate your emotions when you get overwhelmed. I walk away from a conversation with you feeling reassured, and that we can work together to manage complicated things.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual spark: Big points for any regular habit of consuming books or audiobooks, movies, podcasts, etc. Related traits I value include curiosity, some amount of introspection, an ability to hold ideas in tension, and a sense of humor. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdventurous outlook: I’m looking for someone who does things. I enjoy challenging activities like spending long stretches outdoors, visiting countries with very different cultures, or attending sporting events (even in bad weather). Extrapolating slightly, life often involves some amount of discomfort, but staying on the couch is so much less memorable – let’s embrace the chaos and create a big life together.\r\nAbout me\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a mechanical engineer at an infrastructure construction company based in Kansas City. I’m not sure if I will do construction or live in Kansas City forever, but I enjoy the stability and work-life balance I have at the moment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn my free time I enjoy being physically active (lifting weights, triathlon training, and hiking, rock climbing, snowboarding) writing essays about sustainability and global development on my blog, exploring Kansas City (attending live music or sporting events, trying new bars or restaurants), spending time with friends and family, practicing the piano, and traveling. While I sometimes stay in reading or watching movies, I generally prefer doing things outside the house. \r\n\r\n\r\nI used to consume a lot of nonfiction explainer podcasts and YouTube videos, trying to “understand” the larger world, but have gradually become more interested in fiction, as well as learning about psychology, relationships, and leadership. There is a balance to be found in news consumption – while it’s possible to follow events too closely for one’s own mental health, I think we have an obligation to be informed and have opinions in a democracy. \r\n\r\n\r\nI really think that smartphones (in particular the ability to infinitely scroll through brain rotting short video content) are terrible for us. While I’ll never get rid of mine because it’s incredibly useful, I try to avoid using social media apps as little as possible. Work by Anna Lembke and Michael Easter, and to a lesser extent Jonathan Haidt did a lot to convince me. \r\n\r\n\r\nI consider myself somewhat religious. I grew up Catholic and attend Mass sporadically, but aspire to be more regular. I find Catholicism comforting since I grew up in it, and resonate with the idea of a monotheistic God, but suspect that if I was born in a different tradition I would practice that. I’m open-minded to people of different religions, as well as people who consider themselves agnostic. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m not in a hurry to start a family immediately, but am certain that it is something I want to do within the next 5 years. At the moment, I am focusing on my trajectory (career, social life, and being active). Eventually I hope to have a financial base solid enough to simultaneously continue saving for my retirement, travel regularly, travel regularly, save for childrens’ college funds, and maintain a decent standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuss Roberts suggests using “someone you’d like to visit Rome with” as one filter for deciding who to marry. If I were to visit Rome, I would like to visit important buildings of ancient Rome, see some art museums, and enjoy Italian food and wine, and build in time to walk without a specific destination. More important than specific activities, I’d like to be joined by someone who could help me discover all the city has to offer – someone who wants to be curious about it all while helping me find different ways to appreciate it, and reminisce with me about the experience afterward.         \r\n\r\n\r\nMy parents remain happily married. Having divorced parents is not a red flag, but having examples of loving adults somewhere in your life is definitely a green flag. No two relationships are identical, but all happy families have similarities, or whatever that Tolstoy quote is. I aspire to be an active participant raising kids while they live at home, and remain connected to my wife after they move out.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf this sounds interesting: fill out this form to go on a date some time, or send me a Twitter DM!\r\n\r\n\r\nJust reach out, or get a mutual friend to introduce us! My threshold for first dates is fairly low- I'd rather test the chemistry quickly than spend lots of time texting.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a serious partner in the long term, but no pressure! If we hit it off but not romantically, I'm glad to be friends as well."

I am Mahir Jayswal a dedicated Software Engineer at the esteemed Capgemini IT Company. 🖥️ Hailing from the vibrant state of Gujarat, India, I currently find myself immersed in the dynamic tech landscape of Bangalore.\nA Tech Explorer with a Taste for Adventure:\nBeyond the lines of code and the realm of debugging, I find solace and inspiration in the world of literature. 📚 A bona fide bibliophile at heart, my free moments are often consumed by the written word. From captivating novels to insightful tech manuals, each page turned is a step closer to expanding my horizons.\nTraversing the Uncharted Territories:\nVenturing far beyond the confines of my workspace, I've embarked on numerous journeys that have taken me through the mesmerizing landscapes of South India. 🌄 From Kolkata to the historic ruins of Mysore, every destination is a canvas upon which I paint memories. My YouTube channel serves as a testament to these exploits, offering a glimpse into the harmonious marriage of technology and travel. Through my videos, I strive not only to capture the essence of the places I visit but also to shed light on the technical facets that make these explorations possible.\nA Symphony of Knowledge:\nFueling my quest for learning, I've carved out a niche in the digital domain with a blog channel that delves into the depths of technology, programming, and beyond. 💡 My writing is a manifestation of my unquenchable thirst for knowledge, delivering valuable insights to those who seek them.\nA Culinary Odyssey and the Call of the Wild:\nWhile my fingers dance across the keyboard to craft code and captivating content, they are equally at home in the realm of cooking. The culinary arts have captured my fascination, leading me to experiment with a myriad of flavors and cuisines. 🍳 This mirrors my approach to life itself – a constant experimentation and blending of diverse elements.\nTrekking through nature's wonders and hitchhiking along the road less traveled are pursuits that invigorate my spirit. The thrill of the unknown and the allure of discovery guide my steps, both in the wilderness and in the world of tech. 🏞️🚗\nSeeking a Like-Minded  Adventurer:\nAs I continue to traverse the intersections of technology, travel, and taste, I am on the lookout for a kindred spirit. An individual who, like me, revels in the sensory pleasures of gourmet delights, craves the thrill of uncharted destinations, and finds solace in the pages of a well-worn book.\nSo, if your heart beats to the rhythm of exploration, if your taste buds tingle at the mere mention of exotic flavors, and if your mind eagerly absorbs knowledge like a sponge, then perhaps we are destined to embark on a shared journey through the digital and physical landscapes that lie before us.\nMy love languages are quality time and personal touch!

      "fullText": "﻿I am 24 years old, cis female, 5’6” and 145 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am looking for a relationship with deep emotional intimacy, lots of time spent together, and a view to living together and spending years in a committed relationship. I am open to such a relationship having romantic and/or sexual elements; however, I don’t really experience sexual and romantic attraction, at least in the way it has been described to me by others. I do find some people more physically attractive than others and am more open to having romantic or sexual relationships with those people, but sex and romance are optional for me and I don’t experience anything like crushes or a sex drive. Relatedly, I have pretty restrictive boundaries around sexual activities in particular and typically want to do them infrequently. I’m not going to give more details on my preferences here just to avoid a TMI situation, but if this might be a deal breaker for you feel free to ask me about it whenever you feel comfortable doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven my ace/aro spectrum status, and the fact that I experience next to no romantic jealousy, I would be happy for my partner to have other romantic and sexual relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nActivities I would enjoy doing with you include dancing, singing, cuddling, improv comedy, deep conversations on philosophy and psychology, watching crime dramas and sitcoms (My favorites are Community and Better Call Saul), going for nature walks, going camping, going to the beach, traveling in India or Europe, and trying new and unusual things.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have taken the Giving What We Can pledge and I currently help organize the local Portland EA and rationality group which I founded back in 2015. I am currently unemployed but would like to work in animal welfare in some capacity once my mental health and motivation improve.\r\n\r\n\r\nI suffer from mild anxiety, low motivation (and occasionally other depressive symptoms for months at a time), and addictive tendencies (I am currently trying to get clean from kratom but am struggling and have repeatedly relapsed). I am on the autism spectrum (have you noticed?). I am extroverted, agreeable, and tend to have very low-conflict relationships. I have only ever been in one long term relationship which was very fulfilling and ended agreeably due to mental health issues on the part of my partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy having conversations on politics and philosophy. My politics are fairly centrist with some left-wing and some right-wing opinions on individual issues. I am very open to having relationships with people that have very different political opinions to me. My moral philosophy is something like moral anti-realist utilitarianism with an acknowledgement that my true values (as revealed by my actions) are many and my moral intuitions will never fully conform to an internally consistent system.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not particularly interested in marriage as I see a lifetime commitment as being unrealistic. I would however be open to having children together a little ways down the line, especially if you can support me taking 5+ years off of work to care for them. If we did have children I would want to make a strong commitment to staying together as long as doing so would be better for the children than splitting up, and if marriage is important to you as a symbol of that commitment I would be open to it. I am also open to not having children.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to starting with a long distance relationship while I’m in Portland and would consider moving to nearly any large city, assuming I am able to work remotely (bay area would be preferable if I can’t). I would greatly prefer one with an active EA community, but would consider a place without one for the right person. I would enjoy living alone with my partner or in a group house with likeminded people.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I would benefit a lot from being in a relationship with someone more conscientious than me who could encourage me to develop a greater sense of responsibility and work ethic. I like to be pushed a bit towards greater commitment to my long term goals, as long as the encouragement is positive and not shame-based.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to a relationship with someone of any gender, up to 45 years old but prefer someone closer to my age (24). \r\n\r\n\r\nContact me on facebook if you’re interested."

The piece currently playing is Jean-Philippe Rameau - Suite in A minor/major. I don't enjoy the Baroque period too much, I feel that I am more Classical and Romantic. Modern is good but it goes too crazy sometimes. I've been learning a lot about the different eras of classical music through this project, you can check it out and notice that it is a tool for naive listeners. Thus, no, I am not a musician but I had a deep appreciation for classical music. I'm 40 years old and I'm comfortable in my own skin. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy native language is Portuguese, Brazilian portuguese. I started learning French on Duolingo for fun (387 days streak) however, Je ne parle pas français. I can understand Spanish but not talk. I am not a very talkative person.\r\nI actively participate in social dances including Zouk and Forro (my culture) and more recently in Contact Improvisation and Comtemporary dance. I am interested in Microfuzion but haven't tried yet. Connecting with my own or another body is a delightful experience for me. Dance is transformative. However, no, I am not a professional dancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent a significant amount of my time developing computational approaches to analyse biological data. More specifically, studying the relatioships of epigenetic modifications and psychedelics. The goal is to discover novel plasticity mechanisms and understand how they coordinate the overall large-scale neural plasticity. Oftentimes it is challenging but also fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very curious and moved by an existential disquiet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in El Cerrito, CA.\r\nThe best way to reach me out is by texting me at Instagram @marcos_abraao_art or Facebook"

      "fullText": "﻿As of Feb 2024– Thank you for stopping by, but I’m currently dating someone! I’ve dropped this doc in multiple places, so this seems the easiest way to update all interested visitors. Best of luck to you!\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, I’m Nancy. 32/F/NYC (but remote friendly)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my lifelong goals is to become more of myself every single year. It is the most meaningful act of creation (rather than discovery) I can do, and I want to do it at an intensity that I’m slightly embarrassed of the person I was the year before. I try hard to create my own sense of consciousness rather than inherit it, so oftentimes I oscillate between existential angst and actively white-knuckling figuring— often with a bleeding heart. I question the status quo, search for greater meaning, and try to discover alternative ways of being.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more deeply I’m connected with myself, the more I can truly connect with others, without my projections, expectations, and dependencies. I’m looking for a partner similar committed to self-awareness, with the eventual goal of healthy interdependency. That takes seeing each other for who we are, and creating space for both of those people and iterations of those selves.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral attitude\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.”— Anaïs Nin\r\n* My default replies are: “why not” “yes, and” \"can we!!!\"\r\n* Variety is the spice of life\r\n* Courage the Cowardly Dog is my spirit animal\r\n* “We’ll figure it out”/good enough \r\n  \r\n  \r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-professional Resume\r\n* Frequent solo traveler\r\n* Intl digital nomad for three years\r\n* Sabbatical was backpacking thru South America for 6 months\r\n* Fundraiser for grassroots nonprofit for working class Asian Americans\r\n* Built a community of Asian American progressive women to pass a NYC Resolution with City Council\r\n* Multi-day hiking treks in Chilean Patagonia, Peruvian Andes, and throughout Mallorca\r\n* Lived in a co-living community\r\n* 2 Half Marathons\r\n* Burner\r\n* Have guided 6 friends into therapy/helped them find their therapist\r\n* Have extracted myself from an enmeshed familial dynamic and have healthier relationship with parents (WIP)\r\n* Take pride in often being mistaken as my friends’ partners (public acknowledgement that depth of intimacy is not reserved for romantic relationships!)\r\n* Can karaoke sober for hours  \r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t expect you to have a similar history— in fact, it would be great if we could introduce each other to new interests! Hope you are interested in exploring some of these though because it would be fun to continue onward deepening these interests together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Relationships\r\n\r\n\r\nI value and invest a lot in my friendships, they are the grounding forces in my life that enable me to go far and wide in the world alone. My friendships abroad simultaneously make the world smaller and expand my horizons. We heal and grow in the spaces between us. I love people, caring for them, learning about them, being close to them, advocating for more adult sleepovers, extended living with one another, building lives in community.\r\n\r\n\r\nI define love as a verb, a practice that you commit to, daily fidelity over grand proofs of love, demonstrations of care, prioritization of each other. What that looks like is an extension of oneself to nurture another’s mind, body, spiritual growth. As James Baldwin said, loving anybody and being loved by anybody is a tremendous danger, a tremendous responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, being committed to each other also means being committed to growth, individually and as a team. It could mean that our lives will be a little unconventional, or the distance between us ebbs and flows, or that we'll have chapters of navigating trying times. Hope you're up for lots of intentional check-ins, and being really accountable to yourself for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoving someone requires seeing people for who they are, outside of their relationship to you, and letting them be who they are. You can feel connected and invest in someone, but it doesn’t mean feeling entitled to control them or making them your personal projects. I’m looking for a kind of love/life that’s triangular: an orientation beyond our love for each other, towards external elements in life — which is to say, life itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few tweets of mine\r\n   * https://twitter.com/nanseaful/status/1637917957329133568\r\n   * https://twitter.com/nanseaful/status/1633708623024074757\r\n   * https://twitter.com/nanseaful/status/1654829322807521282\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I like\r\n* Good food & cooking & sharing food esp desserts\r\n* Live music\r\n* Dancing harddddd\r\n* Learning at workshops, panels, author talks, book festivals, immersive theater, scavenger hunts, escape rooms\r\n* Hosting powerpoint parties, death parties, murder mystery parties, food tours\r\n* Commitment, follow through, trust\r\n* Deep conversations & probing questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I’m trying to get better at\r\n* Meditation\r\n* Patience with myself and life\r\n* Yielding control\r\n* Consistency\r\n* Resting\r\n* Forgiving others\r\n* Tennis\r\n* Surfing\r\n* Writing\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople things have said about me\r\n* High agency character\r\n* Energizer bunny\r\n* Impressive rate of follow-through\r\n* Community builder\r\n* Very creative thinker\r\n* Kindest listener \r\n* “Being loved by you feels like the warmth of the sun on both sides”\r\n* “You taught me what friendship is”\r\nWhy I will contribute to our arguments\r\n* I am a litte impatient (overbearing)\r\n* I am intense (tiring)\r\n* I am insatiable (unfocused & restless)\r\n* I overthink (anxious)\r\n* I bruise easily (see forgiving bullet)\r\n* I run late a lot (annoying)\r\n* I get lost a lot (annoying)\r\n* I lose things a lot (annoying & expensive)\r\n* I can be notoriously inattentive (see last three bullet points)\r\n* I sleep too little and late (worrisome)\r\nWays I like to be relation with my partner\r\n* Our relationship is our priority\r\n* Not necessarily similarity, but compatibility\r\n* Lots of physical affection\r\n* Info dumping\r\n* Conspiring to take fun very seriously\r\n* Creating our own world of joy > pleasure, soul > gold, creative work > business, meandering > perfection; impractical, local, small > capitalism, soft tenderness > control; going together > going far\r\nDealbreakers\r\n* Apolitical people - the choice to be “apolitical” is usually just an endorsement of the status quo and the unexamined life. Also, I am the proud daughter of Vietnamese immigrants, so know that conversations about race relations (in the world, between us) will come up in the meta, value-driven way, but also the personal lived ways (cultural traditions & how we spend time with my family & create our own). My closest friends are LGBTQ. Our performed gender roles will affect what we expect from and how we relate to each other. We also live on this same overheated Earth lol.\r\n* Neoliberalism - bro it just doesn’t work like that\r\n* Prefer petless partners, but this is negotiable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’d like to know about you\r\nReach out to me responding to one of these questions:\r\n* What’s the last thing you learned about yourself?\r\n* What’s a lesson you keep having to learn, and why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested, write to me at nancyjnguyen@gmail.com."

      "fullText": "﻿Let’s go on a date!\r\nHi, I’m John! Email me at johnrwoolley0@gmail.com\r\nGeneral Me stuff\r\nI’m a textbook nerd in a lot of ways: I like sci-fi, video games and programming, and I sometimes get fixated on niche topics like the history of earth’s climate or Sumerian civilisation. I am always excited by the complexity of the world, and driven to understand whatever I can of it. I love the rush that comes from figuring out something complicated. If you’re into something I’ll enjoy learning about it from you!\r\nI get a lot out of creating things. It scratches a deep itch in my soul to make a piece of software, a story, a work presentation, or even a Minecraft build.\r\nI am quite independent-minded and happy spending time by myself (only child thing?). I’m a ‘small group of close friends’ person. I sometimes have to persuade myself to go and meet new people, but I generally enjoy it when I do, and I’m able to find something in common with whoever I meet.\r\nIn 2022 I signed the Giving What We Can pledge to give 10% of my income to charity over my lifetime, and I get a lot of satisfaction and well-being from helping to solve the world’s problems in whatever small way I can. I’ve been meditating daily for a few years and it’s been hugely influential on my life/ethical philosophy, as well as helping with my tendency to overthink and get anxious.      \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nShorter points\r\n* I’m 31 and I live in Manchester, UK. My degree was in mathematics and physics.\r\n* I’m a software engineer. I’m currently on a machine learning project (I promise to shut up about it if that bores you!).\r\n* I like reading books of all kinds (I read slowly but I get there!). I’ve also written two (bad) sci-fi novels and I’m trying to finish my third.\r\n* I exercise most days, though I’m not a particularly sporty or outdoorsy person.\r\n* I used to play electronic keyboard a lot, I occasionally still do.\r\n* I’m generally organised and tidy, with both physical possessions and general life admin.\r\n* I almost never do alcohol/drugs (except caffeine; I drink unreasonable amounts of tea).\r\n* I’m open to either a mono or poly relationship.\r\n* I haven’t thought a lot about having children but I believe I could be happy with or without them.\r\nYou\r\nI’m looking for someone to have a long-term relationship with, maybe marriage, kids etc. I don’t have a lot of dating experience, so I am generally open-minded about the whole thing. That said, I am attracted to femininity in its many forms (sorry gents, I’m straight as they come). If you’re aged 25-35, and living (at least partly!) in the UK, let’s chat!\r\nBonus points if you live near to Manchester, have an intellectual curiosity, and would be up to playing video or board games together.\r\nTrivia\r\n* My best ever reddit post is a cool fact I learned about prehistoric humans. Other highlights include one of my minecraft builds and this thread I started just before Russia invaded Ukraine.\r\n* I’m a bit of a picky eater (I lived off huel for a while) but I do occasionally like making shortbread or cheesecake to share with people.\r\n* I’ve been collecting houseplants recently. Three and a half out of four are still alive, which I consider a great success!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me at: johnrwoolley0@gmail.com"

I’m currently trying to figure out how to convert part of my apartment into a robotics lab!\nBlogging - I started this a few months ago. So far I’ve mostly been writing about forecasting / prediction markets, but there’s a bunch of other random stuff I’d eventually like to write about\nI’m interested in pretty much anything adjacent to science, technology, politics, economics, progress, “ideas”, philosophy, … I have more of a problem sticking to any particular project because I’m interested in too much stuff versus not having enough ideas for interesting things to do\nNon-technical/nerdy\nWatching sports, especially NFL, NBA, and Golf (but really anything). Go Packers!\nWatching TV shows and movies\nExercise - I lift weights and/or run most days\nPlaying sports - I enjoy pretty much anything, but especially basketball\nOutdoors stuff - camping, hiking, biking, etc. My family has done a bunch of road trips to different parts of the country, mostly visiting national parks / outdoors places and I definitely want to do more of that in the future. I’ve been to 46/50 states!\nExploring different cities\nCooking - I got really interested in cooking a few years ago and I really enjoy it (and I’m pretty good at it now!)\nPersonality\nRelaxed, low-stress person. Rarely get really high/low emotionally\nGoofy, although it takes a bit for me to get comfortable enough around people to let this side of my personality out\nFairly quiet / introverted,  especially around people I don’t know well. Once I’m with a group of people I know well I’m pretty lively though\nOkay being on my own much of the time, but also really value social time in low-to-moderate doses\nCompetitive - but only in a fun way, not in a “takes-it-too-far” way\nAnalytical - I mean I do programming and prediction markets for fun, lol\nValues\nI want to help as many people as possible be happier, healthier, and more fulfilled. This is a guiding principle when making big life decisions\nI agree with the basic ideas behind effective altruism, i.e. that we should try to be strategic about how we “do good” in order to maximize impact and that people far away matter as much as people close by\nI also want to be happy myself! Lately I’ve been trying to get better at building and maintaining relationships with friends and family. I’ve become increasingly convinced that strong social connections are the key to happiness\nReligion: Agnostic. I was raised Catholic, but stopped believing sometime during high school. I miss the community and ritual that went along with being religious though. (I would be okay dating someone religious if my agnosticism wouldn’t be a problem to them)\nPolitics: liberal - I agree with most of the ideas outlined here\nGoals/Ambitions\nI think I can accomplish a lot and feel compelled to try and have a big positive impact on the world. I’m not totally sure of what the best way is for me to do this, but it’s my main overarching life goal\nI really like to make things and think I’d be good at doing some kind of startup. I’m currently planning to try this in the next couple years\nI want to have a really great group of friends that’s mutually supportive and that I hang out with a lot. I neglected this for a few years after college, but it’s something I’m actively working on right now, as I think it’s pretty crucial to long term happiness.\nI really want to run a marathon! I was good at running in high school but then started having foot problems that have plagued me ever since. It would be very symbolically meaningful for me to complete a marathon, since that’s what I was training for when the foot problems started! I’ve made some good progress this year, but there’s still a long way to go…\nWhat I’m looking for in a partner:\nI don’t really know!  I can imagine things working out with a wide variety of different types of people\nProbably it would be good if your values align at least reasonably well with mine and we have at least some shared interests!\nSome other vague things that are important to me: you’re a kind person, you have things you care about / ambitions, and you are generally open-minded and tolerant of different people and ideas\nWhy dating me will be awesome:\nI’m a nice, thoughtful person and really want to build an awesome relationship with someone!\nI will cook delicious food for you!\nI will make cool / silly computer programs, contraptions, robots, etc. for you!\nI will travel and explore the world with you!\nI’m an optimistic & upbeat person and maybe that will transfer to you!\nMy family is awesome and if you like me, you’ll definitely get along with them!\nPictures:\nMore pictures in this Google photos album\nIf you’re interested, you can email me at jake.gloudemans@gmail.com!"

Straight, and looking for a long-term relationship with someone I like enough to build a family with.\nOther things you may want to know (no judgment, we all like what we like):\nI'm 6' 0\", middle eastern, somewhere between average and dad bod.\nWhat kind of person am I looking for?\nCaring and kind\nComfortable being themselves\nCurious. I love talking about ideas and surround myself with similar people.\nNear Brighton / London\nWhat kind of person am I?\nMy friends (if you can believe them) would tell you that I'm\nSmart, and like thinking things through for myself\nCaring\nA bit quirky\nThe kind of person you want as a tripsitter\nFor the most part, I'm average. You wouldn't notice me walking down the street (unless it's summer and I'm enjoying a barefoot day).\nI love to learn, and I love puzzles.

I've also had a long-lasting interest in science and philosophy and enjoy conversations where I get to learn something new about them.\nI taught maths for a while and loved it. I'm now studying again to start a career in software development.\nI am spiritual, but not religious. I believe spirituality is simply the skill of stepping back from things to get a better and more holistic view on them. I would also characterize spirituality as balance, or having a low (mental) center of gravity. I don't follow any specific tradition, but once in a while I will come across a text from some\nwriter\n,\npoet\n,\nphilosopher\n,\nthinker\n, or\nancient figure\nwhich will speak to me in that way.\nI enjoy connecting people who share similar interests (philosophy, spirituality, programming) and have either maintained or created small communities of interest everywhere I've lived for the last few years.\nI'm vegetarian for 10+ years.\nHow to contact me\nYou can send me an email at\n[email protected]\n.\nWarning\nLINK\nYou are about to visit a link which has been flagged with the above content warnings.

      "fullText": "Ben's public dating profile\nHi, I'm Ben!\nI spent much of my twenties dating without direction, and a\nlot of my thirties focused on building my career, so I've not met the love\nof my life yet. I made this page to help change that.\nThe basics\nI'm 42, 6'4\", and date women. I've never been\nmarried, but I'd like to change that. No kids yet, but I very much want\nthem.\nI'm looking for a committed relationship. I'm open to\nstandard monogamy or (once we've built a strong, loving foundation)\nsomething more monogamish.\nI'm ethnically Jewish (50% Ashkenazi) and love the culture, but I wasn't raised with any religion and don't practice any now.\nMy home is in Somerville, MA and I'm pretty planted here.\nLast year, I bought a lake house with my family. We're there almost every\nweekend in the summer, and it's made our already-close relationships even stronger.\nI'm, uh, on the left.\nBelow you'll find more about my family (they're wonderful), my work (software company co-founder, now doing passion projects), my singing (barbershop quartet, symphony chorus), what I appreciate in a partner, and how to get in touch.\nBottom left (2021)\nFamily\nI won the family lottery. It's almost certainly the best thing about my life.\nI have a younger brother who lives nearby and is one of my favorite people. He's married with a young son and daughter. I knew I would enjoy being an uncle, but I'm liking it even more than expected. I almost can't talk about my niece and nephew without smiling.\nMy parents also live nearby. My mom is smart and warm, and my dad is ridiculously handy and protective of his people.\nThey're a very welcoming group. We're all excited to integrate my eventual partner into the crew.\nThese kids are so cute it's criminal to have to blur their faces.\nWork\nI'm the co-founder of\na software company\nI started in 2018 with two friends. It went really well! This year, my co-founders and I put new leaders in place and stepped away from day-to-day operations.\nI'm lucky enough that I don't currently need a day-job, so I spend most of my time pursuing passion projects. Lately, I've been getting rather\ninvolved in local politics\n(I recently hosted a mayoral debate in my city!) and building a community called\nFractal Boston\n. Fractal is a group of friendly, ambitious people who eat dinner together every Sunday and help each other grow.\nSinging\nOne of the things that brings me the most joy in life is singing.\nI was fortunate to be raised by musical parents who encouraged me to join choruses at an early age. Thanks to them, I've been singing in some ensemble or another for ~30 years.\nCurrently, I sing with the Tanglewood Festival Choir, which performs with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\nBefore that, I sang in a barbershop quartet for 10 years alongside my brother. I miss that group a lot and hope to start a new quartet someday.\nI've had so many rich experiences in those groups, and I'd love to tell you about them in person.\nBut for now, here's a little glimpse of my quartet at one of our coolest gigs:\nMy quartet singing the National Anthem at Fenway Park. (2016)\nThings I love in a partner 😍\nYou're emotionally warm and have nurturer energy. You have a ton of love to give, and are excited about receiving it as well (I'm very affectionate and always have been).\nYou think we'd be good at making each other laugh. I seem to value having a funny partner more than most. I've found it makes life\nso\nmuch more enjoyable. I love quick-wittedness and callbacks. These days, I most enjoy the comedy of Shane Gillis, Taylor Tomlinson, Mike Birbiglia, Jordan Jensen, Tom Segura, and Bo Burnham.\nYou're excited to start having kids in the next couple years (after dating, marriage, and at least one serious adventure).\nYou’re excited to start having kids in the next couple years (after dating, marriage, and at least one serious adventure).\nBecoming a father is very important to me, and I’m open to a few different paths to get there — ideally having biological kids together, but I’d also consider options like surrogacy or adoption if that’s something we both feel good about.\nYou're willing to live near Boston most of the time\nThis is a pretty hard deal-breaker for me. I very much want to\nlive near my family a lot of the time. That said, if there's a part\nof the world that's important to you to be in, I'm down to live\nthere some of the year! (Want to get away from New England winters, for example? No problem.)\nThings I would be excited to do together\n(Just some rough ideas. Naturally we're going to come up with our own list.)\nChoose a time each week to check in and connect, and treat it as sacred.\nDecide which of life's default settings we're into, and which we think we can improve on.\nStart a business (Highly optional! Only if it flows).\nCreate the circumstances for spending lots of time with the people we love.\nPick a doubles sport and get into it.\nTelepathically communicate that we're ready to leave the gathering.\nImprove the societies we're a part of.\nThings that might not work for you\nI am socially quite liberal, but my economic views lean libertarian. I tend to think that capitalism and free markets usually (though not always!) produce better outcomes than their alternatives. I don't automatically think big businesses, corporate profits, or rich people are bad .\nI'm a bit allergic to people using astrology as a truth-finding tool.\nGetting in touch\nIf you think we might be a match, I'd love to hear from you:\nben@benorenstein.com\nPlease don't feel like you need to include as many details as I have here. However, I'd appreciate it if you included at least some basics and a few photos. If you have links to online presences that I can check out, that'd be great too.\nI hope to hear from you soon! :)\nBonus Photos\n×"

The top-left is the most recent, at LessOnline. My hair gets rave reviews for reasons I don’t fully understand.\r\nBasics\r\nKids: No        Hookups: No             Monogamy: No        Relationship Anarchy: No\r\nAge: 33, mostly uninterested in dating below 25.\r\nOrientation: Straight, to a first approximation         Kink: An obligate dom, as far as I know\r\nContact info: ja.kopczynski ~at~ gmail .dot. com, Discord @_jisk\r\nRelationship Goals\r\nI’m not currently seeking a specific thing. I would appreciate having a primary relationship. I would appreciate having a couple more secondary relationships. (Maybe even both of those.) I would appreciate a quasi-primary long-distance relationship where we spend a few weeks a year in the same place and are effectively primaries then and secondaries the other months. In general terms, I’m a little under-saturated in close relationships and would like to fix that.\r\nValues\r\nEpistemic Rationality - I’m a pretty committed epistemic rationalist. Believe true things, even if they aren’t useful; say true things, even if they aren’t comfortable. I don’t pick fights about this much anymore, but it’s there and it’s not going away. I’m particularly harsh about self-deception. Beware telling yourself lies, because you’ll forget they’re lies.\r\nEffective Altruism - I’m an EA in the sense that I signed the Giving What We Can pledge and roughly agree with the EA movement about what charities count as effective. I’m not an EA in the sense that I don’t try to maximize the good done - I delegate all the optimization to the big foundations and don’t worry about it.\r\nAI Singularity - I don’t expect my retirement fund to be worth the bits it’s printed on. I mean, I have one, but still. We get doom or utopia; there’s no middle ground. This doesn’t come up much day-to-day, but it’s there.\r\nHobbies\r\nGames! - I have a floor-to-ceiling cabinet of board games and don’t play nearly enough. I have a list. Twilight Imperium is on the shelf twice, but I also love much lighter games like Tokaido, Tsuro, and King of Tokyo. I also enjoy many video games, D&D and derivatives (I prefer 3.5/Pathfinder), and making my own tabletop games.\r\nWorldbuilding - Whether it’s creating my own D&D setting to run campaigns in or taking a video game or CYOA prompt and running with it to flesh out the world around it and write stories in it, I really like worldbuilding. It’s much more fun with an audience, and collaboration has been fun.\r\nWriting - It’s fun! And, surprisingly, uses very different creative muscles from programming, despite still being sitting at a screen hitting a keyboard. I have written a fair amount of glowfic, and a lesser quantity of standard-variety fanfic. I also have some porn but I’m not willing to link that to my name in a publicly-readable document. \r\nMeetup Hosting - I host a LessWrong meetup in my (big) living room every week, rotating through topics. It’s meant to be a place where new members of the community can meet established ones, and a generally structured social hangout for our many awkward nerds. Want to meet me without going on a date? Ask, or take a look on Discord here.\r\nFire Arts - I don’t do this nearly often enough, and don’t have any pictures, but I do fire spinning. My preferred prop is a pair of clubs, and I can do most things poi can do with them. I strongly recommend it - it’s a good workout, and also everyone looks hot with fire in their hands.\r\nRitual Design - I don’t do this as much recently, since I no longer think there will be enough generations of the rationalist community to need ritual to stay value-aligned, but I’m interested in the cautious, well-considered use of ritual. And the misuse of it. It’s powerful but dangerous.\r\nHates\r\nWoo/Spirituality - It’s like religion but without the social benefits that made it worthwhile for most people for centuries.\r\nCircling/Authentic Relating/Nonviolent Communication - This is toxic coercive bullshit in sheep’s clothing and I do not trust it within 500 feet of my brain. It’s like someone decided the problem with social status was that it wasn’t pervasive enough and was too easy to see coming.\r\nAnticapitalists - I cannot stand people who blame the world’s problems on ‘capitalism’, talk about ‘late-stage capitalism’ (there’s no such thing and that’s quite obvious) or ‘degrowth’ (probably the most evil economic philosophy extant), shit on Amazon, or generally ignore the way that capitalism has pulled the world out of poverty in a way nothing else came close to addressing. It’s a berserk button.\r\nDate Ideas\r\nI’ve enjoyed\r\n* cuddling and reading stories aloud\r\n* watching shows together and riffing/heckling\r\n* wandering the streets and talking\r\n* playing games together - competitive or cooperative, board or video, puzzles, whatever\r\nAnd expect I’d enjoy\r\n* going somewhere tall and enjoying the view\r\n* beta reading each other's porn\r\n* learning to dance together\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix: Detailed Explanations\r\nKids\r\nI do not want kids for myself. This wouldn’t necessarily be prohibitive if my partner really wanted them, but IME I only like about half of kids, even the kids of parents I like. This seems prohibitive. Does not rule out me dating someone with existing kids if they’re not planning to get more, if I get along with the existing kids, but it’s basically prohibitive on the ‘having more’ front.\r\nMonogamy/Polyamory\r\nI’m in a long-duration secondary relationship I don’t want to break.\r\nI practice hierarchical polyamory.\r\nMany sources such as More Than Two will tell you this is a red flag, but this is incorrect. Hierarchical relationships set an absolute minimum amount of communication about the health and status of the relationship.\r\nAlso, considering the record of drama in the relationships of the authors of MTT, which produced multiple accusations of abuse, does not inspire confidence that their relationship advice is good. Also, all dramabombs I have been witness to in poly circles derived from refusal to label relationships or violation of the clear boundaries of hierarchical relationships. I consider this evidence that hierarchical poly is in fact a green flag; relationship anarchy and other nonhierarchical styles are the red flags.\r\nEffective Altruism\r\nI’m not out to do the most good I can. I’m out to be a good person by my own lights, according to a non-deceptive and particularly non-self-deceptive definition of good person. I thought about it for a while, decided EA was probably right, joined a meatspace community with a lot of EAs, still thought it seemed right, and took the GWWC pledge as a concrete commitment when I had a job and could clearly afford it. My last annual donations were an ad-hoc mix of GiveDirectly, GiveWell, the EA Funds Long-Term Future Fund, and MIRI. Past years have also included CFAR but they lost my trust due to woo and Circling.\r\nStraight*\r\nI’ve dated transmasculine people but I lost interest as they got more masculine. I have not recently noticed any interest in anyone but cis women. Sorry.\r\nKink\r\nWhen I say ‘as far as I know’, I mostly mean ‘last I checked’, which was… like four years ago for most purposes. I spent a couple years asexual due to medical side effects (worth it), and that only faded this year.\r\nHistorically, I’ve been interested in mild sadism, hypnokink, low-grade forced exhibitionism, and improvised bondage. I like rope bondage in theory, but getting real practice in is difficult without an accessible ‘demo sub’ so I suck at it. I like the idea of ‘feral’-ish fights for control, but it may turn out I hate that if I lose."

      "fullText": "﻿Date me!  😊\r\nHey there, I’m Brian, a 44 year old native of Austin TX!  The dating apps felt too much like a psychological-social-torture-experiment (that I was actually paying for), so it was time for something new! \r\nHere I am…………..laid bare…..during doom metal goat yoga!\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho am I?\r\n·         Grew up on a ranch in Austin, studied computer networking, worked as Server Support and IT Security expert and then retired from it at all 33! \r\n·         Currently commercial real estate investor and receive passive income from those buildings, which makes time for all my fun hobbies. \r\n·         List of Adjectives:\r\nCerebral, generous, handy, healthy, funny, silly, (just a little) obnoxious, sarcastic-ish, ambivert, an inventor of cuss words, and sparingly (but strategically) vulgar at safe times\r\n·         Love Language:  Physical Touch\r\n·         I like to be valued, appreciated for my many skills, and lean towards giving Acts of Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality (Psychetest.com) evaluations score me as The Chameleon and “Middle of the Roader” and it’s damn accurate.  Email me for a copy of my results 😊:\r\nChameleons can adapt to almost any social situation, whether they're among a throng of partygoers or in reflective solitude. Known to be fairly friendly and gregarious people, Chameleons aren't hard to like or connect with; they're good conversationalists, good listeners, and great company. Although they're more than happy to join a boisterous get-together, they do enjoy some quiet time on their own as well. They're approachable and relatively unreserved individuals whose presence is neither obtrusive nor inconspicuous.\r\nMiddle-of-the-Roaders enjoy a good mixture of spontaneity and predictability, although too much drudge work will bore them after a while. Just when people think they have this somewhat conventional type pegged, the Middle-of-the-Roaders' underlying free spirit will occasionally burst forth in a desire to steer off-course and try something new and exciting. These are the type of people who will generally fly under the radar, but they can sometimes surprise others with what they are capable of accomplishing when they are able to buckle down and focus. This may be particularly evident when they are working on a project that they are passionate about.  Middle-of-the-Roaders are reasonably emotionally stable, so no matter how much stress they are under, they will somehow manage to set things at even keel...eventually.\r\n  \r\n   \r\nThings I’m into..\r\n-Gardening / Horticulture 🌵🌱\r\n-Cooking (I like to cook and make salsas with veggies from my garden. Lots of Indian food too)\r\n-Sculpting (…and can make silicon molds, an plastic/wax/metal castings)\r\n-Making custom planter pots\r\n    \r\n\r\n-Travel (Been to 11 countries, 4 continents, and counting)\r\n    \r\n\r\n -Boardgames🎲  (developing a card game now)\r\n-Video games 🎮\r\n-Working out 4+ days a week (I prefer HIIT bootcamp style classes, but I’ll hit a gym with you)\r\n-Books (most recent includes…Stormlight Archives, 3 body problem, Kingkiller chronicles)\r\n-Music, concerts and festivals.  ACL is a yearly ritual (Weekend one 2023!). Very into metal 🤘🏻 but I listen to alt rock, EDM, house, etc. From Tori Amos to Pink Floyd to Behemoth and Rotting Christ. No country please.  Here’s a rare glimpse of my glitter mohawk at ACL.  The ACL producers made me “Naruto run” back and forth in front of the huge ACL sign in Zilker for their promo video!\r\n                                   \r\n-Investing (Real Estate, stocks, etc)\r\n-Movies and TV (still love Alamo on occasion, but I run my own complex media server at home to keep me entertained)\r\n-Technology  (generally anything goes here)\r\n-Late evening snuggles on the couch\r\n-Tea  (I love coffee but recently found out it doesn’t love me 🙁)\r\n\r\nStrengths…\r\n·         Empathetic and socially intelligent.  I’ve put in the introspective self-help work.\r\n·         Very self-sufficient:  I repair/upgrade things around the house, I am the IT support staff, car mechanic, stock broker, (almost) a vet tech, gardener, professional cleaner.  I wear a lot of hats and can converse about almost anything.\r\n·         Healthy…never get sick (never got Covid somehow)….everyone thinks I’m mid to early 30’s!  haha. 👍 Was a vegetarian for 12 years.\r\n·         Very flexible schedule, and a good amount of free time since I get passive income.\r\n·         I have my proverbial “shit together”….but do any of us really? 😊\r\n·         I’m not into “sportsballs” but don’t care if you are.\r\n·         I have crypto but have no desire to talk about it. LOL\r\n·         Yep those last two are definitely considered Strengths when you compare me to “the average male”\r\n \r\nMy stats…\r\n5’9”  - Yes that’s my real height…not 5’8”, and not 6’14” 😉\r\n165 lbs\r\nNeutered✂️ and Vaxxd 💉\r\n100% STI and disease free, and keeping it that way.  GGG  😁\r\nAgnostic, plus I vote Left 96.3% of the time\r\nNearsighted as fuck…….like -4.50….\r\nIQ 139…..yes….6 points shy of genius.  🙁\r\nI have three clubbed feet   Kidding\r\n♌🦁 -Leo if that matters\r\nI have a “two-pack” of abs, not a six-pack.  Sorry. Yes, I’m serious. But I’m in shape!\r\nTattoos on left side of torso, and a full sleeve on my right arm.  They’re all nerdy; ask me about them.\r\n🍆 – just email me LOL.  Definitely not bragging posting this on an open document….\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle/Situationship/ “RealTalk”:\r\nHear me out.  LOL.  Stay with me now!  I’m 44 years old and if you got this far in life without “baggage” or “experience” then you’re in a totally different 1% group than the rest of the world. 🤣🤣🤣\r\nCategorically I am a monogamist person at heart, but I have also learned so much by being open/poly.  Ultimately I’m poly-friendly and could make it work with the right person, but “monogamish” is definitely the direction I’m facing now.\r\nMarried for 23 years (yep we were young) but became open/poly/whatever five years ago. Functionally we are separated, as she has a primary girlfriend she is exclusive with; we have separate bedrooms, and we live independent lives while co-parenting two older daughters. Both are high schoolers, and one is about to go to college. The kids always come first, but they are not little, nor high maintenance. 😊 And I am DEFINITELY not looking for someone to raise my daughters.  Working on getting a second home, but it’ll be a minute with this economy and the state of housing. She is kind and supportive of me while I have had other partners the last five years.  There are no fireworks, “red flags,” or ugly dynamics at all between us.  She is gay.  I support her.  It’s called love.   But she has her person now and I need my person too…and she’s definitely out there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m not into……a.k.a. “dealbreakers”\r\n·         Insecure-Anxious Attachment types, or “face hugger” types\r\n·         If you’re reeeeeeeally into crystals….probably not gonna go great. I can talk aliens and metaphysics or whatever….but if I smell tin-foil hat conspiracies….i’m out.  LOL\r\n·         High emotionally oscillating people.  Yes – emotions are important and so very human, but my batteries drain faster around those that display a myriad of daily feelings.\r\n·         Trumpers…conspiracy theorists…strong religion/faith/belief systems. Nope.\r\n·         Aloof and “catch me if you can” types.  This is a profound lack of social intelligence to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you’re not going to get from me….\r\n·         Marriage. I want to be together for the rest of our lives, but I see little reason to re-marry, comingle finances, pay for a wedding, and ride the “relationship escalator” up midway through our lives.  Let’s leave the “serial monogamy” to the boomer gen.\r\n·         Children.  I have no issue if you have kids, but I will be making no more…\r\n·         Phone calls.  LOL.  I’ll take a call but they’re not my favorite…  \r\n·         Night-owl/party-animal behavior.  Don’t let the fun photos fool you too much….I’m a bit of a homebody, but I can burn it down once in a while.  It’s not my primary method of operation, however. Definitely a morning person.  😊\r\n·         Cohabitation.  This one is tricky but I’m not at all looking to merge our lives together and move in.  I reeeeally like my space and environment the way it is.  Hopefully you like yours the same. Can we spend a great deal of time at each other’s houses? Yes! But a full time move-in? Nope, sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities I’m looking for in a partner:\r\n·         has several of the same interests as me!\r\n·         appreciates and respects space so I can reset and center myself.  I not only value downtime, but I also absolutely require it.\r\n·         wants to travel\r\n·         is self-aware and understand boundaries\r\n·         has clear communication abilities (talking and communicating are two different things)\r\n·         can apologize when they fuck up\r\nUltimately, I’m looking for someone to enjoy quality time, laughter, concerts, travel, games, and all-around happiness with.  Someone that’s ok with the mundane, the “regular” walks of life at times. Let’s be the best of friends forever…..or at least as far as we can push it. \r\n \r\nHow to connect with me….\r\nIf you or someone you know feels like I’m crazy matcheable, send me an email.  Yes it’s my spare junk email, but hey, I’m an ex-IT Security guy and I need to protect myself online, just like you. 🤷‍♂️ Once we’re that far, we can share social media so we are better acquainted.  Oh and pleeeease ask anything you want answers to.  Assume nothing, question everything; I promise to not get offended!  foreverjunk99@gmail.com\r\nObligatory awful stereotypical bathroom selfie…..but at least I’m not holding a fish:"

      "fullText": "﻿Nice to meet you! I am a 38 year-old man living in middle Tennessee and looking for a monogamous relationship with a woman. Like most folks, I’d love to find someone nearby but I am not opposed to long-distance either with the intention of joining forces one day. I’m not interested in having kids and while I’m an atheist, I don’t mind it if you have other religious views.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a thinly-built white guy who tends to straddle the line between introversion and extravert; I do normally score an INFJ on the Myers-Briggs personality test and am comfortable with labeling myself an “Advocate.” That speaks to my nature of always wanting to be helpful and try to improve things for those around me and afar via art, work, or just being a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n        Getting fancy! 🙂                                         Standard-issue Jeremy\r\n  \r\n\r\nI found my current part-time role in marketing during the pandemic and enjoy what I do - especially since it is a non-profit. I have been in marketing for over a decade and found the scripting, planning, and development of campaigns very interesting. However, I recently got the itch to focus more of my time in the arts so I also spend half my time in my studio drawing, crafting the next big Halloween costume, or writing. I’m thankful I can support my financial goals through work and still find the means to get into my passion projects. I’m moving slowly into the publication space - children’s books and comics - and couldn’t be more excited about it!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nOtters - pencil drawing                                              Fancy Octopus costume\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAside from art-making, I am big into running as my main form of exercise. Hiking or walks through new areas are great and I am considering bird-watching in the future. I’m a competitive person so board games and some casual video gaming are high on the list of ways to bond with other folks while also keeping the mind sharp. The Frist is among my favorite places to visit and sketch. I wouldn’t mind some more traveling in the future, especially with a special someone by my side.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Parthenon - another great place to visit in Nashville; this is one of my favorite drawings in my portfolio\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you are an ambitious and/or creative person, I bet we’ll get along well! I really admire those who set out and actually make an attempt at accomplishing their dreams, regardless of the outcome. My ideal match also values staying healthy, honesty, integrity, and patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m at a stage in life where I wouldn’t mind finding my life-long partner though I feel there is still time to let things unfold naturally. Part of the fun in dating is getting to know someone so if I seem like a potential good fit for you, send me an email at heyitsmrj2@gmail.com and use “Date Me” in your subject line. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you have a wonderful day and wish you the best,\r\nJeremy"

Anyone with interests as broad as those I list below and of a vaguely similar-ish flavor is welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Dynamics:\r\n* I value friendship a lot, and think that a romantic relationship can’t but be built on friendship.  At the same time, I’m uncomfortable having to guess if a relationship is platonic or not - on such guesses, I have a miserable Brier score of >0.5. I think intimacy is best cultivated intentionally and with care, so unless/until otherwise explicitly stated, I’ll assume anyone contacting me with reference to this doc is at least tentatively interested in a romantic relationship.\r\n* To my estimation, I think any relationship is like a tree - it has to be planted in a soil of at least minimal suitability, but after that, it grows based on how you care for it.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n—--------------------------------------------Further Information about me—--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nMy interests\r\n* Math, Physics, CS: These are the core of my intellectual life; I would prefer a potential partner to be familiar enough with math that we can use mathematical analogies comfortably in conversation.  I thank god every day that I know about eigenvectors.\r\n* History: I mostly read narrative histories (of the ‘one damn thing after another variety’), especially about the Roman Republic, the Byzantine Empire, post-Renaissance Europe, and Qing to modern China.  Lately, I've been trying a different approach, aiming to get a more in-depth understanding of the Versailles treaty and 1919 specifically.\r\n* Debate: I’ve spent a few years as a pretty active member (and eventually president) of my university debate team.  I love the sport, but haven’t been able to stay involved post graduation.  I’ve inherited a residual passion, though, for analytical philosophy and sytstematic argumentation as a tool for learning.\r\n* Language Learning (the useless kind): I spent half a year teaching myself to read and write Latin.  I can read Caesar, and am working on the Aeneid - this is an achievement I’m super proud of!  I translated the pilot episode of Evangelion into Latin as an engagement present for a friend.  I would love to practice speaking it if I can manage to talk someone into learning it ;)  Similarly, I’m more recently learning Ancient Greek with similar aims.  I did eventually stop resisting the pull of my heart and learn toki pona (a kinda silly but super fun microlanguage); after Greek, I fantasize about doing Esperanto but maybe I’ll develop the self-control to stop myself by then haha.\r\n* Chinese (not as useless, plus way harder, so gets its own entry!): I’m studying Chinese now, with the aim of reading Lu Xun and eventually some more modern literature.  I can read vocab-annotated editions of some real Chinese books, so I’m on my way!  I can read pretty well but my listening/speaking abilities are way way lower for now.  As above, the ability to practice with a potential partner (either as a native speaker or fellow learner) would be super fun!\r\n* Rationality-EA Memeplex: I enjoy reading and taking inspiration from everything in this corner of the world, but try to keep some distance to leave room for the cultivation of other interests.\r\n* Exercise/Health - I really like exercising!  I haven’t missed a day in ~ 5 years.  I’m planning to run in the Montreal Marathon, and then in a few months to run the OG Marathon in Greece (from the battle site at Marathon!)!\r\n        \r\nOther pertinent information\r\n* Right now I work as the ‘Operations Director’ at my family’s bakery, mostly to get some real-world experience after spending a long time in school.  I’m fairly-seriously considering a PhD in physics, but am pretty sure I want to move on to something more technical and aligned with my abilities.\r\n* I am gluten-free (due to Celiac disease).  More generally, I find my energy depends on my diet much more than most  - I basically always cook for myself, and don’t put more energy into cooking than necessary for a healthy-if-bland outcome, but cooking with a partner could well be fun and I’m open to it!\r\n* In the past I was pretty (clinically) depressed (mostly because of the Celiac disease mentioned above), but this has improved a lot over the past 5 years as I’ve taken my health extremely seriously; this is relevant in that it shaped me a lot, not because I anticipate being depressed again; I’m doing consistently very good now and definitely expect that to remain the case!  I have a residual passion for pharmacology and neuroscience to boot!\r\n* I do not ever drink alcohol (by choice)\r\n* I exercise daily - typically running in the morning, and tai qi in the evening\r\n* In demeanor, I’m a superposition of “trying to be like Cicero” and “making fun of someone trying to be like Cicero” - not easily categorized as ‘serious’ or ‘silly’, but a delight nonetheless, I’m sure.\r\n* I’ve never been on a date or romantically involved before - I’m pretty sure this is because I don’t understand how dating is supposed to work and not because I’m generally awful, but hey, caveat emptor I guess :’)\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\nIf you’re interested, you can contact me by email: [Given name] [Two Initials of family name, no hyphen] at protonmail dot com\r\n\r\n\r\n—-----------------------------------------------------Pictures below—------------------------------------------------\r\nI promise I can make other facial expressions, just not for pictures :’)\r\n________________"

(Go, Pack Go!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m heteroromantic and on the asexual spectrum.  Specifically, I’m cupiosexual (Someone who doesn’t experience sexual attraction but still desires a sexual relationship).  That said, I believe sex doesn’t make or break a relationship, and I would be open to dating someone who doesn’t want sex.  I’m also a Christian, and my faith is very important to me.  I would prefer to date someone who shares my faith, but it’s not required.\r\n\r\n\r\nI graduated from Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in 2017 from the Digital Media Technology program.  I am still searching for a job in my area, preferably in a video production type of role.  I’m a very creative person.  I run a few YouTube channels and a podcast, and I recently wrote a feature-length screenplay.  I’m a musician as well.  I write my own songs and recently started a music project with an internet friend.  I’m also very computer-savvy, having created a few Hackintoshes in the past.  I’m not really a coder or developer, but I wouldn’t mind learning one day.  I’m very much someone who likes to continue to learn new things.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include:\r\n* Autism/Neurodivergent Rights\r\n* Theoretical physics\r\n* Lost media\r\n* Copyright law (reform/abolition)\r\n* Anything Disney\r\n* Music, especially:\r\n   * Owl City\r\n   * Coldplay\r\n   * Twenty One Pilots\r\n   * Imogen Heap\r\n   * Taylor Swift\r\n   * Sophia Fracassi\r\n   * Victoria Duffield\r\n   * Anything Pop/Top 40\r\n   * (I’ll listen to nearly anything)\r\n* TV Shows, especially:\r\n   * Doctor Who\r\n   * House of Anubis\r\n   * Thomas the Tank Engine\r\n   * Castle\r\n   * General Hospital\r\n   * Ghostwriter (1992 PBS show and Apple TV+ Reboot)\r\n* Theatre\r\n* Writing\r\n\r\n\r\nMy love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and physical touch.  In terms of what I look for in a partner, I’d like someone I can form a genuine connection with who can take me on their next adventure.  I would like to try to get out of my small bubble and see what else is out there.  I also wouldn’t mind working on a creative project together with my significant other.  My ideal partner currently doesn’t have kids, but I would be open to starting a family one day.  I’m monogamous and would prefer to date someone close to me, but I am open to long-distance relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m sorry if this is all over the place; I generally suck at bios.

I love los angeles and have always wanted to live here; spent all my summers in california growing up so I associate the air here with vacation and family :) Kind of feel like I’m living out my dream here even though I’m not a famous singer or actress 😂\r\n\r\n\r\nFun facts about me… I have grapheme-color SYNESTHESIA and I have recently fallen in love with ice skating and it’s taken over my life outside of work. I live alone and seriously contemplating getting a cat. I’m half korean and spent a big chunk living in seoul for the first 6-ish years of my life so I can still kind of speak korean well enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeen in 2 serious relationships before and probably most interested in monogamous relationships though if someone were poly I would still consider dating them as well, and I’m open to dating both men and women although I don’t actually have experience dating women (yet😭)\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m quite independent, neurotic, thoughtful, image-conscious, and in the process of transitioning from pessimist to optimist (it takes work!) \r\n\r\n\r\nI believe dating is largely a numbers game but I have this new thing I’m trying instead of short coffee dates where the first date is a strict 5 minute video call (timer and all!) to facilitate meeting more people conveniently and with less time commitment.

      "fullText": "﻿Julia’s date-me  \r\ntl;dr \r\nHI! I’m Julia. I made this doc because I’m looking for a fun and joyful partnership filled with travel, adventures big and small, deep conversations, and community. I want to build a (monogamous) relationship filled with intention. I want to be a team, be each other’s sounding board about ideas that thrill us, be a source of comfort on hard days, and to laugh (a lot!) together. (Friends often comment on how much I laugh.)\r\nWe’ll hike in the redwoods, lose our voices at a 90’s sing-along with friends, and go on a quest to find the best ice cream in Sonoma. juliaheartsthebay@gmail.com \r\nSome basics\r\nAge: 40 (looking for someone in their mid-30s to mid-40s)\r\nGender: Female                Location: Oakland                Sexuality: I identify as straight                Monogamy?: Yes, please! \r\nHeight: I’m tall! (5’9”) and usually date people 5’8-6’2” but open outside that range!\r\nWants kids: 90% no (climate change), but I love kids and have lots of kids in my life and am OK if you have kids already.\r\nThe 10% is open to it with the right person and circumstances.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you Not everything below is necessary, but if some resonate we’re likely compatible! \r\n\r\n\r\nYou feel a responsibility to help others or make the world a better place, and likely do that through your work. This could mean you’re a teacher, a policy wonk, a nonprofit worker, a doctor, or a therapist. It’s unlikely that you’re an engineer working in big tech or selling things. This is a central part of how you operate in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou are self-aware and are comfortable talking about your feelings and communicating generally. You have really deep friendships (even if it’s a small number) and connections, and you are looking to build a relationship with someone and are excited about the collaboration that takes. You may have been through therapy or in other ways have worked on yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou enjoy physical affection. You like to snuggle on the couch and give each other shoulder rubs. This isn’t a lot of PDA when we’re with friends and it’s OK if you need alone time.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are active and think about health. You like to get outside and move in some way or play a sport for fun. You might also like to indulge sometimes, but it doesn’t look like ordering in Domino’s every week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have your own life and you go after happiness. You know what makes you happy and you’ve built that into your life. You have a strong sense of agency and in moments that you’ve been unhappy (in a toxic job, etc), you’ve changed it. You have a strong sense of gratitude for the things that do bring you joy.\r\nAbout me\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI feel a strong moral obligation to help other people. I visited a number of developing countries when I was young and it really shaped me, especially my understanding of wealth and privilege. I have worked in politics, at environmental organizations, with sustainable farmers, in journalism, and in progressive advocacy organizations. It’s a central theme in my professional life and a big part of my identity. I work for a startup that builds nonprofit fundraising technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have good work-life balance and boundaries… and I love having fun! I don’t work crazy hours, have a very active social life, and spend time on hobbies. I love game nights, fun ways to connect with community, and opportunities to live life to its fullest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends are very important to me. I’m often central to organizing social things in my groups of friends, whether it’s bringing a friend who is having a tough week a meal or organizing a 2 week remote working house in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m active - I play pickleball several times per week, hike, walk with friends, and swim. I like to be outside and in the trees. I had some serious injuries in the last few years (broke my ankle, injured my spine) and recovering from them made me very grateful for the ability to be active and pain-free, but also put a high priority on health and being strong.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI like adventures. I get excited about a lot of things - whether it’s a road trip to Montana, hiking the W in Patagonia with 10 friends, or checking out new breweries in the Bay Area. I have worked remotely for 6 years and often visit friends or family or beautiful places - I love to life hack to make the most of things. I spent a year of the pandemic living for a month in different places with 10 friends – we got to explore, cook dinner together, have funny competitions, and play games. \r\n\r\n\r\nI love food - hosting dinner parties, going to fun restaurants, and sharing food. I’m a planner, and would welcome a partner who is also a planner, or who complements that with spontaneity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things that might be notable: \r\n* I’m very positive and feel a lot of agency to find happiness. This doesn’t mean life is always easy or that I don’t get down, but I actively work to change things when I’m unhappy or something is missing in my life (hence this document?).\r\n* I’m a clear communicator and am comfortable being vulnerable. There’s basically no such thing as ‘oversharing’ with me. \r\n* I’m an Enneagram 2 (Helper, don’t care whether you know what this means!)\r\n* My top strength in Strengthsfinder is responsibility (also don’t care if you know what this means!), which manifest in my being caring and generous and often taking on labor when I see a need or opportunity. \r\n* I often process things out loud, and I’m an open book. \r\n* I pride myself on my independence, but the last few years have honed my ability to ask for help.\r\n* I’m someone who sees the silver lining in most situations.\r\nAbout “us”\r\nMy vision for a relationship … \r\n* I have a pretty strong belief that relationships don’t just happen and aren’t just about finding the right match, they take active work. The relationships I most admire in friends have often included couples counseling and working through tough periods in a way that resulted in being closer and stronger as a couple. I like having regular relationship check-ins, talking through what is and isn’t working for each of us, and brainstorming how we can better support each other.\r\n* I care deeply about respecting my partner and what they do and how they exist in the world, and want that in return.\r\n* My top love languages are physical touch and acts of service. My best relationships have included mutually taking care of each other and wanting to do things to make the other happy. One ex and I did fun “surprise trips” for each other regularly. \r\n* Sharing labor is very important to me – this can look a lot of ways, but it hasn’t worked for me in relationships when I feel like I’m doing a lot more of the relationship work (bringing up hard conversations) or the actual work (household work, planning, etc). As a result, it has meant a lot to me when a partner takes things on that I haven’t thought about yet or I didn’t ask them to do. Just because I can do it all on my own doesn’t mean I want to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next?\r\nHow to reach out: email juliaheartsthebay@gmail.com. I like directness - feel free to dive in to explore potential dealbreakers or suggest a date. \r\n\r\n\r\n(Some people wanted more info… if you want more, this is for you!)\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaning into the “there’s no such thing as oversharing,” here are some reflections on past relationships:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did some of my last relationships not work out? \r\n* We didn’t want the same lifestyle (he wanted #vanlife)\r\n* We didn’t want to live in the same place (I wanted to be in California)\r\n* Our politics (and underlying values) were too different \r\n* We had different approaches to relationships – they felt like it should just work or not work, and I wanted to be on an ongoing journey together to make it work\r\n* We had different communication styles and preferences – I would rather talk and hear about what’s not working so we can solve it together and understand each other better, but they found that to be stressful\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat might be things my exes say about me? \r\n\r\n\r\nSome good stuff: \r\n* I’m very caring and thoughtful and generous\r\n* I laugh a lot and love to have fun and I feel excitement and awe at small and big things alike\r\n* I bring up the hard things and am willing to do the work, whether it’s together or work I need to do on my end\r\n* I have great friends!! \r\n* I am great at logistics and making things happen\r\n\r\n\r\nSome bad stuff: \r\n* I have a full life and time with friends is a priority (for an ex who wanted to spend most nights together, this was tough)\r\n* It’s hard for me to feel deeply connected to people who don’t care about and prioritize making the world better; people I’ve dated who were, say, a data scientist at an e-commerce company, found this to be really dogmatic. \r\n* I’m not hesitant to bring up things that aren’t working for me; especially when I’ve dated people who don’t feel as comfortable doing this, what I have brought up weighed on them or it felt like to them that I couldn’t be happy in the relationship.\r\n* I’m better at giving than receiving - in my best relationships we’ve both given a lot and enjoyed that, but I’ve also had relationships where they’ve felt like it’s a burden. One ex said “can’t you just do fewer things for me, so I don’t feel like I have to do things for you?” BUT I also am working on being better at asking for help and receiving it. \r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for someone who read all of this and is curious, felt that some of this resonated with them, has questions… reach out! Looking forward to connecting with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by other friends’ profiles… thank you. Also, if you want to date a different Bay Area pickleball fanatic who cares about making the world a better place, check out Taren's date-me page as well! She’s a great friend and an inspiring changemaker, and I want her to find her person too!"

My name is Cory Hinkle and I am 26 and am based in Brookville, IN.  I am 5’8” and am a Christian.  I’ve worked in non profit retail at Goodwill for 3 1/2 years and counting.  I enjoy my job, coworkers and the donors I get to help out every day.  Some qualities I believe describe myself are family-oriented, hard working, honest, shy, introverted nerd with a big heart for the people he cares about.  I am looking for a serious, monogamous relationship with a female around the 23-29 age range, preferably Christian.  I’m open to having kids in the long-term, but not interested currently as I help raise my niece already.  She means the world to me and fills that role at the moment.  \r\nHobbies/Interests\r\n* Church\r\n* Video games\r\n* Walking \r\n                  * Archery\r\n                  * Hanging with Family and Friends\r\n                  * WWE & AEW\r\n                  * Shopping, Swimming, Bowling\r\n                  * Alternative Rock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonest Fact about myself:\r\nI just want to be open with whoever reads this and is interested in getting to know me.  I'm usually shy and keep to myself. People that are close to me have always said that I’m quiet at first, but can talk your head off once I warm up to you and get to know you better.  I’m looking for a girl who isn’t afraid of being her honest self with me and is looking for the same in her partner.  I'd love to spend time together getting to know one another and small things like sharing how each other's days went.  I like who I am and God’s blessed me beyond what I could ever write down in this document.\r\nConclusion\r\nI hope if you are interested in getting to know one another better, you can dm me at my Twitter handle @coryclauz, or caboose2233 on my Instagram.  I am open to traveling around the Southeastern Indiana and Southwestern Ohio area if you are close and want to meet and go on a date together if we hit it off.  I am open to going to church together, walking, gaming together or whatever idea you have that sounds like fun.  I hope you have a great day either way if you took the time to read all of this!  Thank you!"

I can be really fun around the right people.\r\n\r\n   6. Mostly vegan. I’ll eat dairy if that chocolate cake is just too tempting or we are outside. I also don’t consume alcohol or have any vices. Physically fit.\r\n\r\n   7. I enjoy frugality as getting deals others can’t get never gets boring! I don’t do fancy dining. Generally very content.\r\n\r\n   8. Not centered on wealth-maximization for self. But I do spend energy on having things I need to be content. Financially stable; I can take an early retirement if I need.\r\n\r\n   9. Career: I work for an educational technology tool nonprofit. I also did some writing on the side. I am also on a little sabbatical and am building a small house for the parents. I intend to transition into helping the homeless or refugees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReaching me\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can reach me on social media (Facebook or Twitter, sorry no IG) or email me at varunarora.mct@gmail.com. We can instantly share digits and move to text or WhatsApp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, so I am looking for friends too! So if you think we would get along, please do message!"

      "fullText": "﻿Connection Quest\r\nI’m seeking a co-adventurer. Welcome to my modern day personal ad. \r\n Visual description of image: Radio City Music Hall in New York City serves as the backdrop, with people gathered around. In the foreground, I stand wearing a jumpsuit with a stripy gold sparkly top, and black pants. I am wearing a sheer cape with flowers on it, a black purse that looks like a large bowtie, and red satin heels. My hair is short, like a pixie cut, and I have gold dangly earrings and a gold necklace. I'm smiling broadly, radiating excitement. \r\n\r\nVideo: link\r\n\r\n\r\nHello there! I'm J, venturing into this digital realm to find a kindred spirit. While most love stories spark in unexpected places, why not create a chance for serendipity here?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the tune of \"If You Like Pina Coladas”:\r\n♫ If you like green smoothies, or getting lost in a board game\r\nIf you're not into smoking, if you don’t think masks are lame\r\nIf you like making goals and dancing, or doing wind sports at the Cape\r\nI might be the one you've looked for, let's go on a fun date ♫\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me: \r\nEntrepreneur, author, angel investor. Into mindfulness, outdoor adventures, reading, writing, songwriting, hiking with my friendly rescue dog, wind sports (wingfoiling and sailing), altruism, musicals, comedy, summer camp for adults, jazz, board games, dancing (salsa dancing, bachata, hustle), skiing, healthy living, offline time & personal growth. Core values: growth, impact, connection, integrity, fun. Looking for something serious. \r\nBasics: 35, she/they, 5\"5, Toronto-based, pan, monogamous, no kids, open to kids/adoption, vaccinated, have a dog, drink sometimes, non-smoker, don't do drugs, spiritual, active, ENTP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether We Could: Dance, meditate, go on outdoor adventures, hike, cook, learn and grow, make a positive impact, play board games, listen to jazz, travel, be silly and have fun. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For In A Partner:\r\nShared core values, a co-adventurer, making a positive impact, kind, emotionally and financially stable. Would love to learn and grow together, be there for each other, be playful, have fun, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntrigued? \r\nIf this resonates, don't be a stranger! If you think we’d connect (whether romantically or as friends), I’d love to hear from you - I created a way for us to get to know each other here bit.ly/connection-quest - or write to me at mightbeyourmatch@gmail.com - so we don’t have to rely on chance or algorithms. Share what makes us similar or wonderfully different. A snapshot of you would be the cherry on top. \r\n\r\n\r\nOr, if cupid points elsewhere, share this with someone you feel I might connect with. If you connect me with someone I end up becoming life partners with, I’d happily give you $1K.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the adventure begin!\r\n Visual description of image: A sunny cloudy sky serves as the backdrop, with the back of a sailboat visible. In the foreground, I sit steering the boat, wearing a silver jacket, light jeans, a black lifejacket, and aviator sunglasses. My hair is short, like a pixie cut, and a dog in a lifejacket can partially be seen beside me. I'm smiling broadly, radiating excitement. \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBuilt with ♥ & Google Docs"

Wonder Woman is a perpetual Halloween costume; I even have the boots! The Biomarkers pic is a screengrab from Function Health, as of Dec 2024. My girlfriend calls me Benjamin Freakin’ Button;)\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, hi there.  Welcome to my Message in a Bottle.  I will send an S.O.S. to the world…\r\nI read the article about “Date Me Docs” in the NYTimes and thought, sounds crazy enough to work. I like the bespoke, unstructured format, and thought it would resonate with “my kind of guy”.   Believing it’s true that – \r\n                   “fortune favors the brave,”\r\nhere I am, baring my soul to the interwebs.\r\nI’m 62 (see the pic on my biological age – 48.4 as of 2024;) –  I’m 5’9”.  While I currently split my time between Louisville and Chicago, I am 100% free to roam (thanks to a remote job, an itinerant nature, and a flight attendant daughter).  I grew up in New Jersey and have lived in Atlanta, Chicago, LA, and NC. I’m a certified city mouse and enjoy day trips to quieter locales. Hobbies and passions include home renovation/DIY, healthy cooking (farmer’s market to table), stand-up comedy, live/outdoor music, and personal development.  I’m not religious, but like Annie Savoy in Bull Durham, I’ve dabbled w/many spiritual traditions including Buddhism (I consider myself “Buddhish”), meditation, radical gratitude, personal development and standing barefoot outside during a full moon (have you heard about earthing?).  I’m warm, affectionate, physical, and come from a loud, close, funny family.\r\nYou:\r\n* Open-minded (you must be if you’re still reading!) You’re curious and enthusiastic, and have lots of interests and passions you’re excited to share. You read, listen to podcasts, etc. to expand your worldview.\r\n* Kind and able to put yourself in others’ shoes.\r\n* Tall (yes, I know everyone says that but I’m 5’9” so I call dibs!)\r\n* Smart, well-informed, well-read, nerdy, and/or into the NYTimes spelling bee or crossword (or will help me with the Qs about sports and astronauts). Smart+ verbal = sexy!\r\n* Masculine, warm/affectionate/passionate, and bring the zaza zu. Comfortable discussing sex and expressing wants/needs.\r\n* Open to trying, doing, eating, and experiencing new things.\r\n* In possession of power tools or excited to use mine.  DIY together = sexy! Ask me about my tiny house;)\r\n* Health-conscious (diet/exercise/wellness) or at least willing to humor me in my latest “program”. Some of my current interests include Wim Hof, the microbiome, telomeres, and the fact that Alzheimer’s may, in fact, be avoidable. There isn’t a “mind/body connection”; it’s all one!\r\n* On good terms with your kids/family/ex and kind to everyone, regardless of their usefulness to you;)\r\n* In possession of TSA Precheck, know where your car title is, and are, in short, a grown-up.\r\n* Able to laugh at yourself, apologize and accept apologies, and keep things in perspective. Humor, gratitude and forgiveness are superpowers, and you’re all about them.\r\n* Willing to do your “work” and know your strengths and weaknesses. Open to exploring personal development and having a shared vision for an exceptional life. My current passion is “Quarterly Quests” –  a way to break down Annual Plans into bite-sized chunks.\r\n* Clear about what you’re looking for in a relationship and ready to take the plunge.\r\n* Ready and longing for a yummy, close, fun, bonded partnership where we root for each other, laugh a lot, are compatible in outlook, values, and energy level, and turn to each other often and say, I’m so glad you finally found me!\r\nMe:\r\n* Basically, I strive to be the type of person I seek. I’ve “done my work.”  I’m not looking for a clone, just someone w/complementary values, life goals, and quirks!\r\n* I’m sensual, playful, and tactile and “physical touch” is definitely a big love language for me.\r\n* I’m a loyal, devoted friend and girlfriend.  \r\n* I’m the most resourceful, “out there” person I know.  I take risks and am willing to work to bring what I want to fruition. (Case in point: this doc) .  My mom calls me “Queen of the Pivot.” Ask me about my tiny house!\r\n* I’m an ENTJ (Myers-Briggs) and an 8 (Enneagram) which means I git‘er done and cultivate great relationships in the process. I’d be interested to know your types and how we would complement each other.  I’m an event producer by trade, and see life as a big, creative  event!\r\n* I have fun just about anywhere, will try just about anything not involving firearms or livestock, and can find common ground and a deep, intriguing line of questions for anyone.  (Dream job: Colbert’s guest host, or the host of the “Diary of a CEO” podcast.)\r\n* I eat and cook healthy, yummy, adventurous food, and love to cook for my man. I’m vegetarian but not about converting anyone.\r\n* No drama, Obama.  I can have the crucial convos, and there’s never any flying crockery.\r\nI’m long divorced and have had a couple of LTRs since.  My kids are grown and off the payroll but still really close.  Ditto my 80-something Mom, who is my model for aging enthusiastically.\r\nInterest piqued? drop me a line at colleencooperlou@gmail.com.  \r\nThanks for reading.  May all beings be at peace, and may all pots find their lids."

      "fullText": "﻿Hi, I'm Ori!\r\nI'm looking for a playful companion to go on shared missions, the piece of myself I don’t know that I am missing... If you resonate with what you read, you can just send me your profile, a small description of yourself and/or answer one of the icebreaker questions I put for you at the bottom. My email: ashesphoenix235@gmail.com\r\nIf you know someone who you think fits, feel free to send them the link to this doc.\r\nAll photos from 2023\r\n    \r\n                                                                                                                         The one with the white shirt is me.\r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\nbased on recent endorsements: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t[Placeholder for sophisticated show-don't-tell pieces of text that display that some of those adjectives apply to me.]\r\nOther long-term customer reviews: \"She is a rare dialectical mix of very rational and very emotional.\"\r\n“Looks like Tinkerbell”\r\n\tWhat tests say about me: \r\n* BIG 5: Very high “Openness to Experience” and “Agreeableness”, average “Emotional Stability”, “Extraversion”, and “Conscientiousness”.\r\n* Outlier scores: Mensa member, hyper-phantasia (vivid mental experiencing), Highly Sensitive Person (HSP: feeling intensely).\r\n* Hogwarts hat announced: 37% Ravenclaw, 29% Gryffindor, 19% Hufflepuff, 15% Slytherin.\r\nWhat I say about myself:\r\n* Ordinary romantic carbon-based cell-cluster looking for their person\r\n* I am into science, entrepreneurship, psychology, health, AI, Sci-Fi, love, and making music. \r\n* I have a personality, hobbies, and questions, like lists and statements with percentages.\r\n\r\nSome hard facts\r\nBody: tiny, athletic (exercises almost every day), in her thirties, overestimated 38% muscle mass (the rest is mainly cucumber), vegan, and low-carb when convenient.\r\nOrientation: Hetero, monogamous, on the demi- and sapiosexual spectrum, switch, unlikely to want kids (20%, in case my future partner can inspire me with his vision of a family and the shared mission around it).\r\nLocation: Currently living in Berlin, but want to move somewhere else. Looking for one or more places to make and call home. Often traveling to explore different cities.\r\nSome soft facts\r\nGood conversationalist. People who have just met me frequently state that they enjoyed conversing with me to an unusual extent, that they feel seen and inspired. Also, partners and friends often acknowledge my constructive and compassionate way I deal with and communicate during conflicts, even in heated situations or when I feel hurt.\r\nFemale MacGyver: I can heat the flat by opening the oven, prepare eggs in a water cooker, find and use the holes in systems. My time on this planet has shown again and again that problem-solving to bring something useful and new to life seems to be my superpower.\r\n\r\nWhat I do\r\nMy calling. The work I do isn't just a career—it's an extension of my deepest hope for humanity. Each small victory in creating positive change fills me with a sense of purpose that resonates through everything else in my life. Operating at the intersection of science, mental health, and kindergarten-ing (leadership ;), I founded, built, and manage a Non-Profit Organization. Based on the principles of Effective Altruism, we aim to do good better and to prove if we actually do that. Soon, I'll attempt to build something new. One thing I am proud of is that I have been the youngest professor ever appointed at the university where I used to work.\r\nMaking music. I play the keyboard and the organic instrument (voice ^.^), very gladly and very mediocre. Single-player and multiplayer modes are available. Genres: mainly jazz, rock, and soul. Covers, improvising, or songwriting. My favorite quote from myself: \"Nothing is so bad that you can't write a good song about it.\" I might get excited to show you songs I contributed to or wrote at trust level 3.\r\nLearning. Learning new things lights a fire in me that's hard to describe—it's that rush of connecting dots, of seeing the world through a new lens, of feeling my mind expanding.There is a long list of topics I'd like to dive into. Recent topics I've learned more about: ETFs, spine-related and supplement science (medical stuff), and how to build and prompt LLM agents. Also, I am still on the journey to finding a type of dance to do regularly again. The latest ones tested: contact improvisation, Bachata and Swing dance (beginner+), before that, pole dance, and Aerial hoop (not so much a beginner).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy social life\r\nCommunities: I love mingling at national and international weekends/events organized by communities such as Dynamite Circle, Effective Altruism, LessWrong, Mensa, Burning Man.\r\nSharing. Understanding how the world works and what it looks like for other people, especially those close to me and those I admire, has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was a teenager. Many thoughts during my day are dedicated to this. I love listening to people sharing their latest insights, ideas, or solutions they came up with, e.g., their new start-up pitch, or results from their daily observations or experiments with reality.\r\nClose ones. The friendships I treasure most are the \"Frodo & Sam\" type, where silence feels as comfortable as conversation, where the connection remains unshaken even through life's storms, and where you know you could call at 4 am, and they'd be there for you as you'd be for them. I feel lucky and thankful to have a few of those humans in my life.\r\nWhat I am looking for\r\nTL;DR: A vulnerable Chuck Norris with empathy ;-). A loving and deep companionship.\r\nI'm seeking someone whose presence feels like coming home after a long journey— safe, and exactly where I'm meant to be. Someone whose mind challenges mine and who knows the melody of my heart by heart.\r\n   * Male and single, 26–43 years old\r\n   * Caring, cognitively and emotionally empathetic\r\n   * Altruistically ambitious: works or would like to work on projects that make the world better. No astrology or healing stones stuff :-)\r\n   * Intellectually excitable: enjoys learning, exploring with their mind, and growing together\r\n   * Emotionally in tune and mature, secure attachment style, high reliability\r\n   * Overall healthy lifestyle: does not need to be a vegan yogi, just someone who takes care of themselves and their future self to age in a healthy way\r\n   * Playful and humorous\r\nPlus points:\r\n   * Would be okay to live in one or multiple moderately-sized cities (300k-1M) close to larger bodies of water, and somewhere not too cold in the winter\r\n   * Has a creative outlet one can engage in together, e.g., plays at least one instrument well, and maybe would like to jam together\r\n   * Might be interested in working on projects, initiatives, or organizations together one day\r\nIn case you’re uncertain how to approach me, here are some icebreaker questions you could answer:\r\n   * What is your current mission, and what would you rise from the ashes for?\r\n   * What was a bold decision that you made recently?\r\n   * What is one thing you changed your mind about recently, and the reason why you did?\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo, no, pinky promise, this is really me! ;-)"

I’ve done enough work on myself as a person that I’m looking for someone that can help me grow and I can help grow as well. Big believer in chemistry; it either works or it doesn’t work. That being said, I’m a slow-burn and an acquired taste.\r\nHere are some things that drive chemistry for me:\r\n* Genuine interest in life and learning more (no one-word answers or feigning disinterest to seem cool)\r\n* Emotional intelligence. Being able to communicate your thoughts and identify your strengths/shortcomings is hot.\r\n* Similar life views and interests, but different enough that we’re not the same person. Hard to quantify or summarize, but we’ll both know.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Enneagram\r\n\tType 8\r\n\tMyers Briggs\r\n\tINTP\r\n\tQuick need to knows\r\n* Male, straight, monogamous.\r\n* 5’9, ~160ish lbs and fairly athletic. Frequent runner/biker.\r\n* Very Liberal policy-wise, but have my limits. \r\n* Raised non-denominational christian, personally non-religious\r\n* Drink 3-5 times a month, generally only there’s an impetus (party, nice dinner,  happy hour, etc.)\r\n* Occasional weed usage. Never have tried anything harder, but could be talked into experimentation.\r\n* Private Banker. I work with HNW/UHNW persons on their unique banking needs, outside of what you’d be able to get from an app or a bank branch. Lots of VC/Tech adjacent people.\r\n* MA in Financial Economics from University of St Andrews (Scotland). Also a CFA Charterholder.\r\n* Kids? I’m mostly on the “no” boat but who knows who or what might change me.\r\nLife Story (the first date drivel)\r\n1. Born and raised in the Chicago Suburbs. Winnetka, if you need to know. If i had to give myself a typecast it would be “the uncool kid that hung out with the cool kids because they all thought he was genuinely fun”\r\n2. I went to University of St Andrews in Scotland. I studied economics, was a rower (and coach), and generally had a great time being slightly immature but also trying to be sophisticated.\r\n3. I came back to Chicago after graduating, and sold my soul to a bank. I dove in way too deep and became way too much of a recluse while COVID raged. \r\n4. I needed a change and used my bargaining power to find myself a role out in San Francisco. I moved out at the end of 2021 and have been trying to find myself again.\r\nI have two great parents (both work in finance too, I know we suck), an older brother who is outshining me by having a fiance + a dog + a house in Chicago, and always grew up with Golden Retrievers and Corgis (cool ones).\r\nMy Flaunts\r\n1. Not a ‘dude’\r\n   1. I do yoga occasionally\r\n   2. Love candles\r\n   3. Great at giving opinions on women’s outfits\r\n2. Wide range of skills and knowledge\r\nDrives manual, knowledge of historical events, wide ranging vocabulary, pretty impressive cardio ability.\r\n3. Intellectual prowess\r\n1. 33 ACT (top 1%)\r\n2. Passed CFA program without any re-takes\r\n3. Went to the #1 university in the UK and got a 2:1 degree\r\n4. I’m hilarious both sober and drunk if you get on my level of goofiness\r\n5. Maturity\r\n   1. Emotional Intelligence\r\n   2. Great conversationalist with middle aged people\r\n   3. Able to rationalize my own and other’s actions\r\n6. Passionate and generous lover\r\nMy secret is eye contact and lots of skin contact. Also, it’s good size and it’s got a curve ;)\r\nMy Faults\r\n7. I’m an emotional work in progress\r\nYeah, I have a therapist (shoutout to Linda). At least I admit it!\r\n8. Trouble keeping my thoughts and opinions to myself\r\nMy boss and coworkers love this trait.\r\n9. I can be a cheapskate\r\nTime to confess I have some socks with holes and buy the cheap paper towels (but not toilet paper. I always have good toilet paper).\r\n10. Trouble admitting when I need help\r\nAgain, shoutout to Linda\r\n11. I need to treat myself better\r\n   1. Skincare routine needs work\r\n   2. Don’t get all my fruits/vegetables everyday\r\n   3. I occasionally wear socks with holes in them\r\n12. I’m a stereotype on paper\r\nWorks in finance, lives in the marina, drives a BMW. I make up for this in other ways (see flaunts).\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________"

      "fullText": "﻿These laundry-list profiles are, in my view, totally beside the point and do not necessarily make for a lasting and fulfilling relationship. What I think does, and what I’d like, is someone who’d like to begin by just entering into a conversation, without a checklist of match-up criteria, just to see what might happen. I’m interested in the person’s mind, how their mind works, what they have to say, what interests them and above all what they say or don’t say in the moment. The thing below is an example of what I had to say at a particular moment, an hour or so ago on August 18, 2023, on a morning when... Which would then segue into whatever was going on in my life and/or mind at that moment that I felt like writing about. I’d like someone else to do the same, and then just maybe there might be a basis for something – indefinable because whatever it is, will evolve and be created by how we interact, the extent to which we trust each other and sense that each other’s well being is important to us. I know this sounds kind of namby-pamby and vague, but talking about which composers I like or which books I read or what I do in my leisure time and my various careers: would that really tell anyone what they need to know? I suppose you could begin by asking yourself, What do I need to know about this person who’s posted this bizarre, possibly unreadable, probably self indulgent, surely stonewalling, and far too long poor excuse for a profile? I mean: what do I need to know in order to have a conversation with him? Or should I just take the plunge and begin talking to him and see what happens?\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse to someone else’s profile: \r\n\r\n\r\nI liked your profile, as profiles go. Meaning I could never write one like that, and I've been thinking a lot about what I could write, and when I have a moment and am in deep enough despair (just kidding, sort of), I might actually write and post one. But I don't really believe in them. I think people should just do what they would normally do if they met at a party or bar or wherever: Just begin talking and see what happens, which is what I hereby invite you to do. Via email at first, and then if it seems right/appropriate and the like, we can talk via a screen or you can board a plane and take a vacation in Budapest, where I live in a mega leafy neighborhood, magnificent view of the whole city from the terrace, beautiful walks and an interesting building (long story).\r\n\r\n\r\nI am of course kidding about the vacation in Budapest, but, well, you know, you never know. And again, in my experience writing into a vacuum as I am now doing (okay, your photos, which are lovely, and the profile, which I liked) doesn't hold a candle to actual communication. One thing we could try is emailing in real time, as opposed to using a chat platform. Or we could do google meet without the screen, which I find distracting, so it would be a free phone call. Or anything else you'd like to suggest. I do have other suggestions, but I've already said enough, probably too much, being brief isn't exactly my strong point.\r\nAnd as you can see there's very little profile-ish here, about my external life, because as I said, I think people should just write or say whatever they feel like writing/saying as in real life. And I really do invite you to do the same, without worrying about the impression it makes or anything like that. I've actually thought about starting a dating app which, like google docs albeit with a various differences, would encourage and enable people looking for a partner to do just that: just talk to each other, but within a particular structure that I'll elaborate on some other time, if we do end up talking to each other which I hope we do. If you have questions, you can ask, but here's what really interests me about anyone I meet, regardless of gender: how their mind works, what they think about, how interested they are in communicating, I mean passionately interested, and in communicating outside the envelope, if you see what I mean. Okay you don't: I mean just trying forms of communication other than the usual getting to know you sort of thing, to which I admit I'm kind of allergic. For example: sitting in silence (could be done on google meet as well, with or without a screen) and then just saying a few words now and then, but allowing the silence to dominate. That can be very powerful. Or deciding to free associate on any word, concept, name, really could be anything, and deciding on that would in and of itself make for an interesting dialogue. Or asking each other questions, but responding with only one or two words, or with a sound, or with silence (you'd say: silence, and then not answer). All this in the interest of getting beyond and underneath the superficial level of things, which when lived in the States, drove me A. crazy and B. into relative social isolation, apart from contacts through work and a relationship now and then, and that is a very long story for another time, or perhaps for never.\r\nSo I hope to hear from you. I do of course have a smartphone (just got it, didn't have one before two days ago), and the landline number is below.\r\nIphone: +36305676368. It's not on all the time because the battery isn't in great shape, so if you want to call, call the landline (+ 36 1 395 8751) and just tell me to switch it on and I will."

      "fullText": "﻿Intro\r\nWell hi there. Looks like you've stumbled into my \"date-me doc.\" Welcome, please pull up a chair and get comfy while you peruse my ramblings. \r\n\r\nBasics (get your checklist ready)\r\nAge: 39\r\nHeight: 5’4”\r\nLocation: Manhattan, NYC\r\nBuild: Curvy/Athletic\r\nHair: Auburn with blue/green on the back half of my head. It’s a cool girl “mullet”\r\nEyes: Green\r\nEducation: BA in Creative Writing/Poetry, minor in Film Studies\r\nJob: Pricing and Yield management, SiriusXM/Pandora Media (left AND right brained!)\r\nRelationship stats: Never married, looking for monogamous marriage/partnership\r\nKids: No (human) children, but want.\r\nAutobiographical Ramblings (oh, god, you want to know more??)\r\nI am a born and bred New Yorker. Yes, we exist. Yes, I know how to drive (current Kadi model comes with a bonus car accessory!). Yes, I regularly get out of the city because I know the world is broader than 5 boroughs. I plan on staying in the city since my family and friends are here, and I own my apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI share my apartment with a tiny furry dictator who throws tantrums when he's not getting enough attention, but is somehow cute enough that I haven't returned him to the shelter. His name is Captain Ignatius, or Iggy if you're a friend (you probably are; he's a belly rub whore).\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been an athlete most of my life (softball, swimming and water polo) and still remain active (kickboxing, gym, rec softball in the park). I love getting lost in a great book or TV show, I geek out on history (NYC history in particular) and 35mm photography. I've traveled some but want to see a lot more of the world, and I'm passionate about human rights of all kinds (LGBTQ, Women's, Black Lives Matter) and animal rights. It is important that my partner understands and supports these as well. I volunteer weekly. I went to a private school in NYC (and hate myself a little bit for having just typed that), and a small liberal arts college upstate. My mother's family is Jewish, but I view that as my culture and not my religion. I’m an atheist. I don't care if you have religion in your life as long as you don't try to convert me or impose it on our life together. \r\n\r\n\r\nI drink and am 420 friendly. I do not smoke cigarettes or cigars and will not date someone who does. I am fairly liberal, so conservatives need not apply. I think common sense is not so common anymore, particularly when it comes to political dogma. I am also always open to thoughtful conversations and debates on most things, so an exact alignment of all my specific values is not a necessity. Respect and morality, however, are.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friends would describe me as sarcastic, funny, “stupid smart”[1], loyal, inquisitive, able to name most actors and at least two TV shows/movies they've been in, and \"the reason I have a beauty product addiction.\"[2] And, my personal favorite: “I'm trying to figure out a way to say \"loud and opinionated\" in a way that doesn't sound like an insult”[3]\r\nWhat I’m looking for (hey, that could be you!)\r\nWhat I am looking for is a partner in the truest sense of the word. A man with whom I can share my life (and who shares his with me), have a child, see the world, and do all the things. I don't have a laundry list of qualifications, but someone who is settled enough in his life that he's ready to be serious and settle down is important. Non-smoker, non-conservative, not very religious. Able to keep up with my random thoughts, preferably sharing some interests, and willing to also let the furry dictator into your life (we’re a package deal). \r\nI would prefer a man who’s at least 5’8”, between 30 and 45, who is based in the NYC area (5 boroughs ideally)\r\nStill here? \r\nYou can reach me at DateKadi@gmail.com, and please include either your own doc or basic details (age, height, where you live, some photos (or social handles)) and what drew you to reach out. I don’t have the ability to answer every email, but I do my best. My socials are locked, and I don’t add randos, sorry! \r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, you want pictures of ME?? Keep scrolling! \r\n  \r\n          \r\n  \r\n         \r\n________________\r\n[1] Best friend #1\r\n[2] Best friend #1\r\n[3] Best friend #2"

Also, wanna try lots of things in my life: https://www.svitlana.me/curiosities.\nSpirituality & interest in the eastern religions/philosophy\nI have been wondering about spiritual-like topics for 3 years now. Some questions are: what is reality? who am I and what is self?\nThe real hunger for spiritual understanding accelerated when russia invaded my home. Check then news on Ukraine. To help myself cope, I have been reading a lot. I think I found some sense equanimity and peace  now that is  becoming more and more present. I meditate, do yoga, breath work, cold plunges on a regular basis.\nMovement\nAt first a coping mechanism, movement now grew into me. I need it and do it often. Not necessarily restricting moving to gym, a square of grass or yoga mat is great too. My goals are handstands, crow pose, pull-ups and flexibility/mobility.\nSeems like I vibe with calisthenics but excited to also try dancing. I regret not doing sports in my adolescence as now there is so much work to be done to get to what I want (e.g. I want handstands and it is hard on both physical and inner-work levels). Persistence and consistency are my best friends here. On a weekly basis I do some movement 5-6x a week (this includes  yoga which many people consider an exercise).\nKindness and love\nKind by nature from my mom and appreciate kindness in others.\nLove — influenced by hippies in sf. But hey love is cool and the world would be a better place if we embraced it.\nSelf-awareness gamey game\nI got to have very random experiences during my life, e.g. living in a dozen of cities around the world and hitchhiking a bunch when I was a naive teenager. I switched “homes” many times and my 5 closest friends are from 5 different countries. As such, I had to learn how to think a lot and choose the best of two/x worlds.\nMy career game\ninvolves me now being a PM at Google’s Labs. thinking a lot and figuring.\ni love my friends so so much\nALT\nThings I like\nBooks: check out my 📚\nbooks and medias. db. recents favs: thich nhat han, creative way, metaphors we live by, consolations, little life, krishnamurti\nReads: check out my https://curius.app/svitlana-midianko2 .\nAlso: breath work, meditation, Sam Harris work, yoga, running, traveling, camping, Bali,  NATURE, cinnamon buns, conversations with strangers, sunsets/rises, mindmaps, books, climbing trees and reading, product management, big history, psychedelics, women’s history, evolution, dogs, temperature play (cold plunges!), dancing, Alan Watts, cross-generational friendships, ecstatic dance\nLife things and mind drills\nWork in progress\nI have soooooo many areas of improvement I am working on. Have tips on how to improve here?\nLetting go of high standards towards myself and other beings\nFiguring out what to do in life\nWhile humbly appreciating things I have been privileged to have.\nIndecisiveness\nIt’s hard to make decisions for me! Contributors: (a) do not know how to listen to my intuition; (b) WIP prioritization skills; (c) I overall just find good things in many things.\nThinking for myself as a muscle\nLetting go of external pressures\nAnd also, building comfort in asking for help\nInsecurities.\nA lot of more on  my substack!\nmy fav weekly routine: handstands class at circus → GGP bike ride + convo w strangers/dogs\nALT\nWhat my friends say: borshch\nIt is hard to have an objective evaluation of a human being, so I found borshch to be the closest proxy for estimating quality of me as future wife.\nBorshch is a Ukrainian soup that takes ~2-3 hours to make and is often cooked as a test for marriage readiness. A wife (yes wife, not a man bc men do not cook!!!) is only as good as her borshch (ah, what a great way to reduce human complexity:).\nMy friend said, “the caliber of a person is determined not by any single borscht they cooked, but that they keep cooking borscht. It is the borscht of the soul that makes the borscht of the stomach.”\nI fed my friends with borshch and asked some follow-up qs.\nbeware that my subjects are coming with personal bias. One friend even ate meat soup  as vegetarian??!?\nALT\nHow likely are you to recommend this borshch to your friend?\nUse three words to describe how this borshch made you feel\nHow often would you eat this borshch?\nThe caliber of a person is determined not by any single borscht they cooked, but that they keep cooking borscht. It is the borscht of the soul that makes the borscht of the stomach.\nThe soup indicates Svitlana is very ready for marriage!! 🤪\nSvitlana is a curious soul who will happily lay under the trees for hours. You will find her doing handstands at beaches (or any other flat surface you can think of), wearing flowers as a hat, or striking conversations with strangers. Ask her about psychedelics and she will give you many good resources.\nShe loves purple, blueberries, and building elaborate Notion pages. Overall, I would describe her as a kind, self-aware, curious, and emotionally mature human being. 20/10. Highly recommend!\nThe Borshch was kind, compassionate, and created a loving environment and home. 10/10, would eat again\nboo\nMisc & bullets\nPodcast in which I talk about my adolescence\nI started Substack!\nI hitchhiked over 10k km when I was 17. It taught me lots of kindness and active listening.\nI was lucky to have lived in seven countries (~12 cities) which helped me build empathy and appreciation for diverse viewpoints. Favorites: for living it is London and NYC; for spiritual growth, it is Bali and India.\nI am Ukrainian. Yes, the war is still happening (on an even larger scale than when the media had incentives to discuss it). Pls check the news and donate if you can.\nFAQ\nIf you have questions, comment here, ask me, or submit via this anonymous form.\n“But hey svitlana what are you looking for in a romantic partner?” - added in anon form in march\n“Hey svitlana, how about your preferences on poly vs mono and gender?” - added as per feedback of too many people\nThanks Alexander Scott for writing an article that explored this theme and sparked my curiosity enough to start this doc!\nLog\nSvitlana-ing\n12/25/2024\nor not\nSvitlana-ing\n02/26/2024\nkinda unsure if i still resonate as much..\nSvitlana-ing\n09/16/2024\nwith self = world, i think this still resonates.\nSvitlana-ing\n03/17/2024\ni sense my friends r tired of my external processing here tho"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\n🥰\nEDIT: As of Nov 2024 - this is now deprecated! 😍 I am now happily married 💍 (and yes, we did meet through our dateme docs 😜)\nGet Notion free\n🥰\nEDIT: As of Nov 2024 - this is now deprecated! 😍 I am now happily married 💍 (and yes, we did meet through our dateme docs 😜)\nDate Me! <3\n😍 Hi there! Welcome to my Date Me doc, which I must admit feels a bit charmingly low-tech in this Tinder age but hopefully in a cute we-bumped-each-into-each-other-at-the-online-coffeeshop kinda way. I'm Connie, a 33-year-old Chinese American techie person happily settled now in SF* after many years of wandering, Odysseus-style, through half the hokiest small towns in the US. I'm short, monogamous, and usually dressed in an alarmingly varied array of colors:\n(me, doing things)\n(me, still doing things)\n(me, doing something I will definitely never do again)\nI'd regale you with tales of my wanderings, but they're honestly quite boring and involve a lot of pet lab mice and early internet fanfic for some reason. The gist of it is that some combination of temperament, parental upbringing, and early Shounen Jump issues led to the dorky, egregiously friendly Huffleclaw you see before yourself today. In my bursts of social fancy I love flittering around novel/weird/interesting-sounding events, philosophy salons, and mysterious houseparties in the Bay, but I'm really an introvert at the core who likes to sun by big windows and nerd out on whatever topic has struck her this week (in my previous life I was definitely a cat, just one of those weirdo bodega ones that like people :P).\nI recharge my batteries on all the cozy things - longreads, podcasts, indie movies, coffeeshops and kava bars, bookshops with that old-book smell and perky plants, dinner parties, morning runs by the water and game nights with friends - but will absolutely get hype for the periodic rave, music festival, or good-lord-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into party. I'm high on the openness scale and enjoy poking at new things - even (especially) if they sound a bit out of my comfort zone - though my hope this year is to run around a little less, figure out the things I really care about, and go all in on the people and pursuits that matter to me. Who knows? That could be you 😉\nA few pluses about me:\nno kids, debt, or crazy exes\nlikes doing dishes and laundry because that's podcast time 👌\nprefers homey restaurants over fancy ones so cheap date\nspeaks Mandarin so kids will be set up for the future 💪\npretty good at charming old people so your parents will like me\nnot addicted to tiktok or insta 😃 (but addicted to reddit instead 😔)\ndecent meme game, if I do say so myself 😎\nMy current obsessions in this “just left the city I was in for a decade, hashtag yolo” phase of my life look something like training for a half-marathon, finally learning meditation (or similar in that vein), working on some AI side projects, researching for the book series I keep swearing I'll write, discovering more substacks to hoard in my email, spending a horrifying amount of time on soccer chats (long-suffering Spurs fan here… don't ask 🙈), and making my new home in SF. If I were to pick the one \"thing\" that really moves me, it'd be the idea of community and how we can better invigorate our society and the platforms we use to foster meaningful relationships, chances for connection, any form of antidote to loneliness that's a little less toxic than some of the tribes that have been forming online. I don't have good answers there but it's a subject I'm very interested in and would love to pick folks' brains on - so if you know anyone engaging in that sphere, I'd be all ears! 😊\nWhat I'm looking for\nA thoughtful, kind, kick-ass dude in either SF or NYC also looking for a life partner, a pet or two, and somewhere within one standard deviation of 2.5 kids (I was an only child and I think a sibling-less childhood just really sucks! I want to make a really fun household 😝).\nI'm super into a rigorous, analytical mind (though perhaps less in the sense of traditional booksmarts than street smarts, or a way of thinking outside the box) and curious, driven people who are always looking to learn and grow. I’ve matched well with honest, assertive, maybe even slightly disagreeable partners who aren't afraid to call me out on things and can balance me out as a teammate (I'll play good cop to your bad cop! The Agent J to your K. The Leslie to your Ron Swanson etc), but I also love goofballs who’ll text me a terrible meme at 4 in the morning. It’s stereotypical but oftentimes I think I’m just looking for someone who makes me laugh 😅 whose values also make me want to be a better person.\nI like sporty people. I like nerdy people. I like people who care; I think I'd take that over super “cool” people, as much as I am awed by their badassery sometimes. I love finding the life in people - passion is just delightful! (Even if it's mainly for fantasy football or large language models 😆). I can talk your ear off when I'm in the mood, but I LOVE people who can match my energy in conversation and even steer it or relieve my burden when I'm tired; and I think it's a great sign when we can do our own thing in companionable silence and enjoy that too.\nAbove all else though, I think personal integrity and, like, just giving a shit about people is sine qua non. How someone treats people, whether they keep their word, whether they can navigate the hard times with a steadiness of mind and character is so much more important imho than a few extra points on the IQ scale or zeros in the bank account. I feel the exact same way about close friends, which is why I call my dream life partner as \"basically a best friend I'm attracted to and want to raise a family with\" - some undefinable formula whose variables are a permutation of friendship, passion, and mutual respect.\nHonestly though, I could go on and on rambling here about a shared sense of humor, high bonding-ness, and a level of introversion that agrees to escape a party at the same time, but I do think most of this you're just never going to get off paper because it's really, like, all about the vibes, man. That's not to say dealbreakers don't exist or that compatibility is wholly unpredictable, but I really like waitbutwhy's take on it - a huge part of it is about who you really enjoy being around, and most of that time won't be romantic dates but grocery shopping and waiting for the bus and blobbing on the couch after work. You want someone you enjoy all the times in between the big vacations and dream travel destinations and Burning Mans with - someone you enjoy cooking dinner on the thousandth Wednesday with, or waiting for the Uber with, or rambling about your day to at the end of a long work week. Most of life is the mundane stuff in between the cool exciting stuff, so I'm looking for someone who I can have a mind-boggling amount of fun just Doordashing and watching Celebrity Family Feud with. That's rather difficult to figure out through a few paragraphs and a photo, so really, if this speaks out to you and we seem like a good match - hit me up and let's grab coffee?\nLifestyle compatibility\nIn a burst of abandon I once signed up for a matchmaking service (note: this did not land me on a Netflix reality show sadly, though it did get me a bunch of spam calls for a year after). The service did not work out as you can probably tell, but what I found interesting about it was that a solid 90% of the intake questions I had to answer was on my lifestyle. I'm not kidding - a quarter might have been about my sleeping habits alone (how late I slept, whether I was a light sleeper, if I needed space in the bed etc).\nThat has made me think a bit more about lifestyle fit. Having great dates with someone doesn't mean it's easy to live with them, and the latter gets much more important in a serious relationship. I'm sure plenty of folks might not put much stock in any of these, but just in case, I'll list some lifestyle traits of mine upfront:\nI'm more of a city gal than a super outdoorsy person, though I do run outdoors almost every day and enjoy a scenic hike or two (and I absolutely love parks!). My favored travel destinations lean towards cities and cultural/historical attractions more than extreme nature spots. Basically I'd pick reading in a cafe or visiting the Louvre over heavy-duty camping most of the time, though I’m absolutely down for festivals in the woods and cabin trips with  friends.\nLong-term I also want to stay around a major city, preferably SF or NYC since my social circles are here and my driving skills are uh, stereotypical at best 😅 Having said that, I definitely understand the space + cost trade-off of living in those cities.\nI'm not a huge gamer, though I've played a few RPGs and enjoy word-based boardgames and co-ops; and as you can tell from the Comic-Con pics, I’m a long-time anime/manga fan and geek out on a lot of things across the board (scifi, Doctor Who, Marvel etc).\nI drink socially, and it’d be nice if my partner could join me there though it’s not a big deal by any means. I'm not a huge foodie or picky but I do try to eat healthily (in moderation!) and am omnivorous with a plant-based lean. It doesn't matter to me if my partner's a serious foodie or vegan or has a lot of restrictions, though if their main hobby is food (e.g. eating out at fancy restaurants every other day) I wouldn’t be able to share in it.\nPolitically, I'm generally progressive, though eclectically so since I prefer to evaluate an issue in its own context instead of feeling boxed into one broad political platform. I'm open to partners on other parts of the spectrum, as long as there's still a values alignment.\nFinancially, I try to be pretty frugal on consumables (I don’t eat expensive meals or buy $400 purses) but will absolutely spend money on what I think of as investments: a high-end laptop, Lasik, a course I’m interested in, anything that makes me more productive at work. I care about experiences, especially the ones best done now (it’s hard to travel when old!) but I think tangible goods have their place in making your life better. Basically, my heuristic is to value the things that will buy me more time with friends. ❤️\nI’d like at least some time to myself most days; I think it's important for couples to have their own hobbies, though I do enjoy parallel play. I don't need my partner to go to everything with me - I can get into really social butterfly moods and if anything I'd much more appreciate having someone to come home to! Later on in a relationship, I'd love a little check-in text/call on days we're apart.\nSpeaking of - I do love texting 🙈 Not a huge deal to me if you don't, but some form of communication most days is pretty important to me. I'd be amped to have someone I can send both serious longreads and dumb twitter memes to, though I don't think there's a need to have a bunch of the same interests - it's more about a similar sense of humor and an interest in the other's life.\nMy love language is literally conversation, though I might file that more under quality time and companionship than words of affirmation. I love fussing over people and end up doing a lot of acts of service, and the Chinese heritage in me likes to say words are cheap, but my last relationship made me realize how much I value open affection. That's both physical and verbal - I can barely remember what I ate yesterday but almost never forget what someone says to me, for both good and bad (this is NOT to say I demand sappy love letters, just that a sincere word spoken in kindness goes a long way with me 😊).\nHit me up?\nFirst of all, you're the bomb if you actually read this far. And if this clicks with you and you think we might be a good match, hit me up via email, Facebook, or Twitter! If you have a similar kind of profile up somewhere that would be great, otherwise I'd appreciate an intro about yourself and what you're into, what you're looking for, pics or socials etc. Peace! 🖖\nConnie Li\n06/28/2023 (edited)\nAsterisk here is that I just moved here from NYC and still hope to visit NYC regularly! Essentially I’d like to go bicoastal, with SF as my homebase. I’m open to dating in either SF or NYC, with a leaning towards SF.\nConnie Li\n05/09/2023 (edited)\nI have learned from being around Bay Area circles I need to specify this 😆\nConnie Li\n08/08/2023\n5’1” checking in here 😛"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi there, I'm Eduardo!\r\nI'm a 27-year-old man doing my PhD in Astrophysics. Yup, I love the stars, but don't worry, I won't bore you with space facts unless you're really into that. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few things about me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I'm Latino, and stand at about 1.73 meters ( 5'8\").\r\n* I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs. I've got no issues if you like a drink now and then, though.\r\n* I'm mostly a pescatarian, but I also enjoy eating chicken occasionally; I cut out red meat a long time ago.\r\n* I’m looking for a genuine, monogamous connection with a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m into:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I care about social and climate justice, and I’m especially passionate about helping students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.\r\n* Environmentally conscious: I do not own a car, so I always bike to places. I try to conserve water and electricity, and I've taken a recent liking to train travels.\r\n* Outdoors is my jam: hiking, kayaking, zip-lining—you name it!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Swimming—it's my go-to relaxation.\r\n* Playing the guitar.\r\n* Cooking and experimenting with recipes.\r\n* Hiking and exploring trails.\r\n* Always up to try different cuisines!\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate in a partner:\r\nI value intelligence, kindness, and someone supportive. Not looking for academic accolades, just someone who's passionate about their work, has a good laugh, and genuinely enjoys helping others and making a positive impact on the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust so you know:\r\nIf we hit it off and decide to meet, maybe we could have a fun story for how we met? Something other than \"online\" — like meeting at a crowded library while reaching for the same book on quantum mechanics. But hey, that's just a thought!\r\nFeel free to shoot me an email at elihumunguia7@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿Swami’s Dating Doc\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I'm a 29-year-old male based in Pittsburgh, currently pursuing a PhD in AI/Robotics. I describe myself as deeply curious about the world with a drive to make a positive impact. I'm seeking a long-term relationship with a woman who shares a similar curiosity and drive. Open to long-distance dating and periodic travel. Please connect me with any women you feel might be a good match. Thank you!\r\nHey! This is Swami’s dating document. It was inspired from numerous other docs here. If anyone recognizes the format or specific phrases, please consider it a nod to your originality! I mean, they do say that imitation is the best form of flattery, right? 😛 Whenever I've borrowed a line directly with minimal modifications, I've made a note of it in brackets. Also, pardon me for making the doc incredibly long (and serious?). I’ve tried to arrange things with sub-headings/headings to help you navigate it. I hope it helps. And happy to receive feedback on how I could improve this doc! Over time, I’ll probably also try to make it shorter and more fun to read 🙃. \r\nContents\r\n* Personality\r\n* Interests\r\n* Career and Passions\r\n* Work in progress\r\n* Dating Preferences\r\n* Other imp stuff - kids/relationship style etc\r\n* Possible cons or sources of incompatibility \r\n* How to Connect with Me\r\nPersonality\r\nThis section could feel like a drag to read. So I would recommend skimming/reading the headings first and then deciding whether to read the corresponding descriptions.\r\nFamily and Friends - A Sense of Duty and Affection: Stereotypically Indian in this respect. \r\nTeamwork and Partnership: I thrive under collaborative settings, both in professional and personal settings. However, until a few years back I didn’t appreciate the value of collaborative exploration in personal settings. Covid thankfully changed that by forcing me into a 1.5 year long coliving experiment with my then wonderful housemates and making me realize the value of deep personal relationships. Ever since I’ve tried to keep the spirit alive. I have as a result built some of my closest friendships and had immense personal growth along dimensions I had mostly considered pointless until then!\r\nConventionally sociable with unconventional interests and aspirations : While my youthful 'weirdness' defined my unique interests, maturity has woven this individuality into a tapestry of approachable and meaningful connections. I thrive on the balance between maintaining my quirks and fostering genuine interactions, embodying a blend of individuality and sociability that defines me.\r\nA Compassionate World View: That doesn't necessarily mean I’m unusually empathetic, or unusually self-sacrificing. But there’s an underlying attitude of valuing things outside of oneself that makes prosocial behavior feel less like an imposition and more like a facet of one’s own desires or personality. To care in this sense is to want to sculpt a better version of the world into existence. (partial copy)\r\nEmotional range : While my external emotional display is adept at adapting to those around me, internally, my personal emotional spectrum can be more nuanced. I seldom feel sadness or anger or depression, and even my moments of genuine joy and excitement come in subtler shades — maybe my time with robots is rubbing off on me 😉! Although that describes my natural state, in environments where I feel at ease, I can consciously dial up the vibrancy of my emotions, embracing a more exuberant demeanor. In contrast, unfamiliar situations demand so much cognitive bandwidth that modulating my internal emotional response becomes challenging. \r\nCuriosity+learning : Stereotypical PhD student/researcher. When a topic piques my interest, it's easy for me to get lost in a book or get lost in deep explorations, diving into their intricate details. I relish sharing and discussing these explorations with friends, family, and colleagues. \r\nThrive on conversations: Related to the above point, I learn and think best through conversations. This is how I A/B test my ideas/thoughts, filter confirmation biases and generate new ideas! And I like to talk about/discuss almost anything under the sun, especially when it’s new territory or something I haven’t thought enough about already!\r\nPeople pleaser : Standard stuff - Have a hard time saying no or confronting people. \r\nInsecurities/Personal challenges: \r\n* Although I love to talk about my interests/explorations, I have a constant insecurity that the listener is getting bored. Partly stems from the fact that the average person does indeed get bored lol. The only way to improve is to get better at using feedback.\r\n* My work is a significant part of my identity. I frequently have ‘midlife’ crises about the social utility of my work. I am in a constant tug-of-war with myself over how to trade-off between more socially meaningful things vs intellectually interesting pursuits.\r\n* Navigating Social Dynamics: Deciding how to best allocate my time among friends, family, and professional obligations is an ongoing challenge. The difficulty in saying no or prioritizing one over the other often leads to existential quandaries.\r\n* And then the standard things - fear of rejection, failure, judgment etc. \r\nOther personality quirks : \r\n* I often have strong opinions but they are also pretty weakly held (i.e I love to change my mind). I pride myself on being open-minded, but I'll admit, I sometimes wrestle with confirmation biases. Conversations have been my best tool to tackle them. I’ve gotten better at it over time, but it’s always a work in progress.\r\n* I love gossip! But I’m not great at keeping secrets 🙊. While I strive to be a vault for serious secrets, the fun ones might just slip out in a playful conversation. Yet, my friends still find me a worthy confidante. Go figure! 😉\r\n* Instinctively I’m a minimalist and like to keep my footprint low. I typically don’t buy things unless it feels necessary. It’s not some strong ideological commitment. Just something I picked up during my childhood. \r\n* I consume very healthy food, largely thanks to my taste buds not caring about taste very much.. Haha.\r\n* I love summer! Winter not so much. Yet I’ve spent 6+ years in Pittsburgh 😅. \r\n* Lastly, I love to make fun of myself (as you might notice from this document) as well as the people around me. Given that I do plenty of dumb things, folks typically find sufficient material to make fun of me.. Haha.\r\nThere are likely many more of these, but I will spare you the rest. I believe that should provide you with a general sense of the tedium you might be getting yourself into! 😛\r\nInterests\r\n* Learning/Intellectual Curiosity : I'm quite curious about the world and enjoy exploring topics that help me understand it better. This can range from the finer points of economics and the dynamic landscape of geopolitics, to the evolving landscape of startups or the intricacies of historical and sociological phenomena. Lately, I've been delving into the following :\r\n   * Economics : Good Economics for Hard Times, Slouching towards Utopia\r\n   * The power of networks : MegaNets, The power law\r\n   * Impact of AI on society : The coming wave\r\n   * Religious history : A little history of Religion, God Human Animal Machine.\r\n   * Self Improvement : Atomic Habits, Stolen Focus\r\n   * General History : Hard Core History podcast, Age of revolutions, End times, The dawn of everything\r\n   * Geopolitics : The avoidable war, The end of the world Is just the beginning\r\n* Hanging out with friends and chatting : In fact that’s one of the reasons I love academia. We spend most of the day chatting and fooling around, even (especially?) during work hours 😂. (and then finally get some work done at night when no one’s around.. This dating doc was a casualty of some of those late-night sessions)\r\n* Physical Activities: My go-to sources for weekly exercise are running, biking, and gymming, preferably with friends.\r\nThings I’m curious about and want to explore\r\n* Book Clubs/Curius App  (social reading/bookmark tool) - Was introduced to the Curius app while going through someone else’s dating doc and have since been using it. Social reading/bookmarking sounds amazing. I definitely want to start using it more! More broadly, I’d love to turn my reading/ listening into a social activity using Curius or by reading jointly with groups of friends.\r\n* Blog writing : I’ve also been meaning to convert a lot of my thoughts into blogs both for personal reference and to disseminate a lot of the thoughts out to the world. But I’ve just been procrastinating on that. Would love to have a partner in crime for this! Here’s a list of topics I’ve been thinking/reading about : Blogs Topic List\r\nCareer & Passions\r\nI’m a PhD student at CMU working at the intersection of optimization and deep learning with applications in Robotics. I started working on it mostly out of intellectual curiosity and felt proud of it, assuming that it will pave the way towards a more productive and prosperous future. However, the recent rapid advancements in the field have spurred some introspection. I now feel there’s a reasonable risk of unfettered progress also leading to societal instability and chaos. Hence, I have been reconsidering my research directions and trying to pivot towards specific applications that have potential to create new markets and industries that complement, rather than just displace, human labor. This has led me to exciting domains like space robotics, human robot coordination etc. \r\nOutside the realm of academia, I'm driven by the urge to adapt our societal structures in anticipation of rapid technological shifts. I have several thoughts on evolving our socioeconomic systems, and designing modern institutions and communities fit for the AI/digital age. I already spend a significant amount of time thinking about them, but I'm keen on exploring these more deeply/working on them soon, perhaps post-PhD. If our paths align or if you're curious about such dialogues (or fancy a spirited chat on UBI vs. micro-credits and how tech could help scale them. I personally prefer the latter), let's discuss! haha\r\nWork in progress\r\n* Crafting my own path : I have had a tendency since the very beginning to be “different”. Defy the local mainstream. Until a few years back, the ‘defiant’ paths I chose also had reasonably clear trails that I could follow. However, my more recent ‘defiant’ interests are far less explored and lack clear trails. Currently I’m trying to figure out a reasonable path forward. \r\n* Improving conversational skills : While I’ve improved a lot in making conversations, there’s still a long way to go. Eg I’m still bad at (a) Pausing and appreciating other people’s arguments (b) Simultaneously reasoning about the arguments in the current discussion and steering the broader direction of the discussion at a meta level (b) conversing with multiple people at once (c) communicating effectively under stress (d) messaging convos, etc. (in summary, bad at multithreading)\r\n* Emotional range - As touched upon in the personality section, my internal emotional range is a bit muted. I’m working on enriching it, especially on the positive spectrum.\r\n* Becoming more digital native - I’m a millennial who’s a bit wary of having a strong digital social presence (I know, we’re a rare breed, but we do exist 😛). But I’m trying to shake it. Blog writing/Cirius usage would probably help. \r\n* Prioritization skills - (a) get better at saying No to things (b) stop doom scrolling and reading arbitrary things. (c) make strict schedules and stick to it.\r\nWhat am I looking for in a partner?\r\nI’m listing some of the qualities that I absolutely love in people. But none of these obviously are requirements.  \r\n* Curiosity + intellectual excitement : There’s nothing I enjoy more in life than trying to learn and understand new things with someone!\r\n* Deeply cares about the world and wants to make it better : I have a deep sense of appreciation and respect for people who genuinely care about the world!\r\n* Unconventional/weird : I have a huge admiration for people defying the mainstream and venturing into the unknown (especially for social good reasons). \r\n* And then there’s the usual stuff like vibe match etc. which we’ll figure out over time.\r\nOther important stuff:\r\n* Location: I’m a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, and I expect to graduate mid 2025ish. \r\n   * I could possibly travel to another city periodically given my PhD doesn’t have a strong place constraint.\r\n   * And I would be more than happy to date long-distance!\r\n* Relationship style: Monogamous.\r\n* Kids: I love children and would like to have (or adopt) kids. In particular, I’m excited to have children with someone. It goes back to the notion of teamwork and shared deep connection that parenting facilitates. In fact, I’m hoping we also develop tools in the process that make parenting more communal for everyone. I think kids are the best source of entertainment and meaning adults get and I want to share it with everyone! Likewise, I think kids learn a lot from interacting with a diverse set of adults! So it is a win-win for everyone!\r\n   * That being said, our mutual understanding and discussions will play a pivotal role in shaping this decision (even of having kids)! If you prefer other ways we could get a shared sense of meaning and connection, I would definitely be open to that possibility as well! \r\nPossible ‘cons’ or sources of incompatibility (beyond what you might have already inferred from above):\r\n* Balancing Time: I’m generally bad at prioritizing and balancing my time. I let whatever gets my attention drive my priorities. It does work well in certain cases when I carefully tune my environment so that my attention is consumed by people/activities I care about. But sometimes it can get difficult when I need to redirect my focus since changing the environment isn’t easy. I can also sometimes overcommit to too many things, which occasionally itself causes a juggle in balancing my time. \r\n* Relationship Experience: I've never tried dating before!! For a long time, I didn’t know what I wanted from a relationship and thought I could get most things I cared about through friendships. My opinions there changed a few years back. But then covid happened and then life happened😂. Also, I don’t like the format that most dating apps offer, and the leap from friendship to romance has always felt daunting. So, I think dating docs really were a saving grace for me both in terms of timing and style! I don’t think I had any chance of dating someone without it (maybe I still don’t, we’ll see 😂 ).  \r\nUpdate : Dating doc was a partial success 😛 . Now, I can say I have dated people!\r\n* Not an activities person: Whether in a small cafe or on a long trip, it's the engaging conversations that I cherish the most, rather than the activities themselves. So I usually prefer activities that are in the service of conversations/chats!\r\n* Dietary Habits: I identify as a \"fuzzy vegan\" (some friends prefer to call me \"fake-vegan\" instead 😉). While I prefer being vegan, there are occasions where I indulge in milk or egg-based products for social/my own convenience.\r\n   * I would be happy to date someone who isn’t vegan/vegetarian though, we would just have some extra cooking to do :) (copied)\r\n   * Lifestyle Choices: I avoid alcohol, smoking, and drugs. However, I'd very much enjoy a partner who enjoys a drink now and then.\r\n   * Family Dynamics: My dad deals with minor mental health issues which occasionally influence our family dynamics. Thanks to effective medication, such instances are mostly under control now. We've also learned to support and uplift each other effectively through these times. I mention this for the sake of transparency and believe it shouldn't be a cause for concern.\r\n   * Taste in Music/Dance/Art: I have a somewhat narrow taste in music! And my dancing skills are completely hopeless! My sense of aesthetics and art is better but not great by any means unfortunately! 😅\r\n   * MOST IMPORTANTLY : I EAT A LOT 😂.  Dining out with me might turn into a patience test for my company!!! \r\nWhat could we do together?\r\n   * Mutual Learning: My top pick! Let’s immerse ourselves in new subjects, teach each other, or delve into engaging books or podcasts. The exchange of ideas is the thrill!\r\n   * Social Gatherings: Spending time with our respective friends is a great way to blend our worlds and share experiences.\r\n   * walks/runs/biking/hikes: Go on walks/runs/biking/hikes and talk or just look at some good ol’ trees… 🌲(copied)\r\n   * Collaborative Projects: Some examples from the ‘interests’ section above include writing blogs together or perhaps starting a podcast! I would also absolutely love to work on a project or try out a new area together.\r\n   * Day-to-Day Delights: The magic is often in the mundane. Activities like cooking or exercising become special when done together!\r\nIf you think we might be compatible or just have some comments, please reach out!\r\n   * Thanks for making it all the way to the end of my document! I already admire your attention span and curiosity! Please leave me a message in this google form if you want to stay in touch or have any comments or suggestions for me! If you think we’re compatible and are interested in dating, please fill out this google form to let me know 🙂. And if you don’t like the format of a google form, feel free to mention that in the comments form and we can try to arrange a call instead!"

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me ;) \r\nHi! I’m Kyleigh, a 30-year-old woman in Southern California. I’m looking for a long term partner. \r\nI recently came across the concept of a Date Me Doc, and I was intrigued. So, let’s find out what happens when I tell the universe exactly what I want. ✨\r\nDIRECTORY\r\n→Get to know me\r\n→What I’m looking for\r\n→Want to date me? \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nGet to know me\r\n* Corporate by day, I’m a senior manager of external communications for a Fortune 100 company. I take pride in being a leader of people and developing my team and our culture, while enhancing my brand’s reputation through storytelling (in a nutshell). Work keeps me fairly busy during the week. \r\n* In my spare time, I practice yoga, hang out with my rescue pup, Tayla, practice self-care and mindfulness, spend time with close friends, enjoy the outdoors, and the occasional trash tv binge. Note: I do not consider myself to be a chronically online person – in fact, I make conscious effort to spend less time behind screens.\r\n* I’ve been single for nearly two years, and it’s been ages since I’ve had a serious long term relationship. I’ve dated here and there, but I’m not interested in wasting time with anyone I don’t feel a genuine connection with. I’m quite independent, and I spend a decent amount of time alone, which I don’t usually mind. I go to therapy regularly, and I’m continually working to make my anxious attachment style more secure. I’m ready for a conscious relationship with someone who isn’t afraid to do the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n→ Things I’m Into\r\n* Camping, road trips, national parks, mountains and other lowkey outdoorsy shit.\r\n* Growth, self-development and manifestation. \r\n* A good book with nothing to do and nowhere to be.\r\n* Warm baths/showers by candlelight.\r\n* Dogs and animals in general. I rescued a 50-pound super mutt, and she’s my bestie/adventure buddy.\r\n* My cozy apartment/safe haven. I like creating comfortable, warm spaces and taking care of my home. \r\n* All things cheese, charcuterie and wine. I won’t say no to being wined and dined. \r\n* Crystals, incense, journaling, moon rituals. \r\n\r\n\r\n→ My Strengths\r\n* My empathy – I have a huge heart, and I can be a sensitive girlie. It’s a superpower and a curse.\r\n* My open-mindedness and ability to see multiple/opposing points of view.\r\n* I’ve built a great life for myself. I’m self-sufficient and fairly successful. I’m enjoying this phase of life I’m in, but I also have a growth mindset and am always evolving.\r\n\r\n\r\n→ My Dreams\r\n* Quit my job and make a living off of my hobbies (just not sure which ones yet).\r\n* Travel and see as much of the world (and eat as many different foods) as I can.\r\n* Find a partner to grow through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\n→ Some Basics\r\n* Height: 5’8”\r\n* Sexuality: Bi+ (past LTRs with men, but attracted to men and women)\r\n* Diet: Omnivore foodie\r\n* Drinking: Sometimes, mostly wine or cocktails with friends\r\n* Smoking: Never, and I don’t date people who smoke cigarettes\r\n* Drugs: Weed occasionally in the evenings to unwind \r\n* Zodiac: ☀️Gemini 🌙 Pisces  ⬆️ Cancer \r\n* Tats: A few small ones ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n→ Lifestyle + Views\r\n* Kids: I’m open to having kids (not a dealbreaker either way), but no time soon and the circumstances would need to be just right.\r\n* Religion: Not religious, but I consider myself “spiritual” in my own unique relationship with higher power.\r\n* Political views: I enjoy having open-minded conversations with thoughtful people, but I don’t consider myself political. I think the bipartisan system is a distraction, and I don’t really identify with a party. \r\n* Causes I care about: Women’s/reproductive rights. LGBTQ+ rights. Living a somewhat environmentally conscious lifestyle. Animal welfare/adopt don’t shop. \r\n* Activity: As previously mentioned, I’m a bit of a yogi. My physical activity hasn’t been much lately beyond yoga and long walks with my dog due to a long-term strain/injury, but I recently got back into circuit training. I also enjoy hiking and kickboxing (though I’m v new to the latter).\r\n* Relationship Type: Monogamous; I don’t like sharing.\r\n* Marriage: Yes, as in the conscious practice between two people who co-create life together. I don’t really envision a big white wedding. More of an intimate destination wedding or mountain elopement type. \r\n* I am NOT a morning person by nature. I usually wake around 7 a.m. and sleep around 11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n→ My Intrinsic Values (according to clearthinking.org)\r\n* Agency/freedom – that I can make choices for myself\r\n* Learning/knowing – that I continually learn new things\r\n* Virtue/embodiment –  that I maintain my humility and gratitude\r\n* Pleasure/experiences – that I experience pleasure and my life is full of exciting things\r\n\r\n\r\n→Photos\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For\r\n* Energy – I want that deep, soul-level connection with someone funny, warm and joyful. I also need someone who wants to put energy in and shows up.\r\n* Ambition, goals and growth mindset.\r\n* Someone good, kind and open-minded with quiet confidence and strong boundaries. \r\n* Emotional intelligence/awareness and someone who can speak my love languages.\r\n* Genuine curiosity for me and my world, deep/close connections with loved ones and a conscious self-care practice that includes mind, body and soul. \r\n\r\n\r\n→ The kinda relationship I want\r\n* Communication is healthy, open and abundant; my love languages are words of affirmation and quality time/quality conversation. \r\n* I’m a highly sexual person, (from what I gather, more so than than the average woman) and I need someone who matches my level of desire/drive.\r\n* We respect each other’s individuality, and together, we co-create a thriving life and challenge each other to be better versions of ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWanna date me?\r\nIf this piques your interest – or you know someone who it might – I’d love to hear from you. Get in touch right here."

As much as I love studying, I like to keep distance between my personal and professional life. I am kind, trying to make a career in the USA. I left my family in India, because it's my dream to study and work in the USA. I completed my masters in ASU and started my full time job with Deloitte in their Audit Team. I love Indian Food and would love to try other cuisines too. I am a vegetarian btw, but don’t mind dating the opposite. I am not religious, but I do believe in a higher power which we don’t know of (yet 🙂). \r\n\r\n\r\nAge: 25 \r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Tempe, Arizona, USA\r\n\r\n\r\nAppearance:\r\n* Height: 5’5\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation and Career:\r\n* Education: CA in India (now preparing for US CPA)\r\n* Occupation: Audit Team of Deloitte in Tempe, Arizona\r\n\r\n\r\nInterests and Hobbies:\r\n* You should know by now watching Series, Movies & Sports \r\n* Playing FIFA on PS. \r\n* Playing Cricket & Badminton. \r\n* Listening to Music. \r\n* Traveling\r\n* Foodie \r\n* Photography (love taking good pictures)\r\n* Spending quality time just - walking and talking.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout My Ideal Partner: \r\n\r\n\r\nI would love anyone with similar interests and doesn’t mind my Indian Accent.

But I also won 2 Cricket Championships in High School - see Not a Nerd too :) \r\n3.

I am Mahir Jayswal a dedicated Software Engineer at the esteemed Capgemini IT Company. 🖥️ Hailing from the vibrant state of Gujarat, India, I currently find myself immersed in the dynamic tech landscape of Bangalore.\nA Tech Explorer with a Taste for Adventure:\nBeyond the lines of code and the realm of debugging, I find solace and inspiration in the world of literature. 📚 A bona fide bibliophile at heart, my free moments are often consumed by the written word. From captivating novels to insightful tech manuals, each page turned is a step closer to expanding my horizons.\nTraversing the Uncharted Territories:\nVenturing far beyond the confines of my workspace, I've embarked on numerous journeys that have taken me through the mesmerizing landscapes of South India. 🌄 From Kolkata to the historic ruins of Mysore, every destination is a canvas upon which I paint memories. My YouTube channel serves as a testament to these exploits, offering a glimpse into the harmonious marriage of technology and travel. Through my videos, I strive not only to capture the essence of the places I visit but also to shed light on the technical facets that make these explorations possible.\nA Symphony of Knowledge:\nFueling my quest for learning, I've carved out a niche in the digital domain with a blog channel that delves into the depths of technology, programming, and beyond. 💡 My writing is a manifestation of my unquenchable thirst for knowledge, delivering valuable insights to those who seek them.\nA Culinary Odyssey and the Call of the Wild:\nWhile my fingers dance across the keyboard to craft code and captivating content, they are equally at home in the realm of cooking. The culinary arts have captured my fascination, leading me to experiment with a myriad of flavors and cuisines. 🍳 This mirrors my approach to life itself – a constant experimentation and blending of diverse elements.\nTrekking through nature's wonders and hitchhiking along the road less traveled are pursuits that invigorate my spirit. The thrill of the unknown and the allure of discovery guide my steps, both in the wilderness and in the world of tech. 🏞️🚗\nSeeking a Like-Minded  Adventurer:\nAs I continue to traverse the intersections of technology, travel, and taste, I am on the lookout for a kindred spirit. An individual who, like me, revels in the sensory pleasures of gourmet delights, craves the thrill of uncharted destinations, and finds solace in the pages of a well-worn book.\nSo, if your heart beats to the rhythm of exploration, if your taste buds tingle at the mere mention of exotic flavors, and if your mind eagerly absorbs knowledge like a sponge, then perhaps we are destined to embark on a shared journey through the digital and physical landscapes that lie before us.\nMy love languages are quality time and personal touch! I’m pretty independent and self-sufficient, but I love hanging out and spending downtime with my loved ones. I also would love for someone to encourage my more spontaneous side!\nLet's connect and embrace the adventure together! 🤝\n‼️ More about me!\nThe things I do in my free time…\nThe things I can’t get over…\nDon't see this is secret 🙈\n2024 RECAP  : Click here\nContact Information:\nYouTube Channel :  click here\nBlog Channel: click here\nInstagram : click here\nLocation: Bangalore, India\nThings I like\nthese all are 0.001%  of my collection\nBooks 📖\nThe Almanack Of Naval Ravikant\nWise and Otherwise by Sudha Murthy\nTuesday with Morrie\nAtomic Habits\nAnimal Farm by Gorge Orwell\nstay hungry stay foolish\nMovies 🎬\nThe Shawshank Redemption\nthe founder\nwhiplash\nking Richard\ndead poet society\ngood will hunting\nEnola Holmes\nSound of Metal\nInto the wild\nSchindler’s List\ncast away\nMitty\nDocumentaries 📽️\nChernobyl\nThe Last Dance\nThe Social Dilemma\nPodcast 🎧\njoe rogan\nhuberman labs\nHabit coach\nMusafir stories\npaisa paisa\nankur warikoo\npostcards from nowhere\nTake a pause with Varun Duggirala\nTed Talks\nMahabharat by Dhruv Rathi\n💬 Subscriber Reviews\n(AKA: What my friends think about me!)\n“ He’s charming, intelligent , and super ambitious.”\n“ Any time up for travelling or any trip!”\n“ Give lot of good reccos… about anything in world & encourage you to do things which makes u happy ”\nPhoto Gallery\nMarine beach, Chennai\nALT\nHyderabad\nALT\nPondicherry\nALT\nMehrangarh, Jodhpur\nALT\nMadikeri,Coorg\nALT\nTriveni Sangam, Kanyakumari\nALT\nRameshwaram The End of India\nALT\nKollam, Kerala\nALT\nVarkala\nALT\nAlleppey\nALT\nKochi\nALT\nHampi\nALT\nDussehra in Mysore\nALT\nCoffee woods Chikkmanglur\nALT\nIIM BENGALURU\nALT\nAdiyogi, Coimbatore\nALT\n2024 RECAP :\nM\nMahir Jayswal\n12/28/2023\nTriveni Sangam, Kanyakumari\nM\nMahir Jayswal\n03/16/2024\nIIM BENGALURU"

My name is Ravi. I’m a 27-year-old man who works as an Analyst. I’m looking for a woman, who is honest & loving and is looking for a primary partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nPersonality\r\nTalking about one’s own personality is always kind of a strange thing to do, but despite that I’ll try to give you some flavor for what I’m like!\r\n\r\n\r\n* Curious - I think the world is very strange and interesting, and I like to try to figure out what’s going on. I see interesting questions everywhere and I am rarely satisfied with surface-level answers.\r\n* Silly - I like to laugh, joke, and communicate through humor. I get along best with people who can lean into the absurd.\r\n* Caring - I care deeply for the people around me, and I love to find ways to make their lives better. I enjoy being cared for in return!\r\n* Quick - I like to think on my feet and have high-bandwidth conversations. I like to be put in unfamiliar environments and figure things out on the fly.\r\n* Weird - Sometimes it takes my friends a long time to figure this out about me (since I’m doing a great job of coming off like a normal person!) but I think the way I approach the world is at core very different from many people. This can be hard to articulate exactly so I suggest that you keep an eye out to try to catch a glimpse of what I mean here.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther adjectives that might be used to describe me include enthusiastic, extroverted, analytical, opinionated, traveller, and jolly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities I enjoy\r\n\r\nGenerally involves a good conversation with a few friends, or some activity like a game or film.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy a constantly-rotating selection of hobbies. Some examples include:\r\n* Hiking / camping / backpacking\r\n* Many different crafts, including woodworking, and making my own backpacking gear\r\n* Playing Guitar(although I am not very good at it)\r\n* All sorts of trips and adventures with friends\r\n* Photography & cinematography is what I crave for \r\n\r\n\r\nRomance-specific details\r\n\r\n\r\n* Relationship style - I’ve only ever been in monogamous partnerships, and I have been very happy with that in the past. I’ve never tried polyamory, and I’m not opposed to the concept, but I’d definitely need some hand-holding if I were to try it.\r\n* Kids? - I really like children but I’m not wild about babies. I could be down but it’d have to be under the right circumstances. I can honestly see it going either way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way to reach out is by mailing me at: roshanraviraj@gmail.com , OR, \r\nInstagram: @roshanstrikes and we can find a time for a call or casual date. I look forward to hearing from you!"

I will graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a master in Computer Science, I have previously attended a liberal art college for my Bachelor. I am not working at a Startup where I manage aviation-related data. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Background : I am Moroccan, hence I am from a warm culture if one must say. I am family-oriented and care about traditional values, I would love to have kids in the future. I am not religious. I admire cultures from around the world, my favorite exhibitions are on the second floor of the American Museum & Natural History in New York. You can download the map here to see what I am talking about. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Off-resume: I love traveling and discovering new places, I do enjoy interacting with locals a lot, and I use Couchsurfing for that. It is very important for someone to try and see what is out there, or try to be curious about what the state of the world is right now - and by that I mean its people. I will not understand someone who is not inquisitive about discovering new landscapes, people, cultures. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Personality: I am versatile. A perfect weekend for me would be biking around the city, walking around a park, watching movies, and choosing a particularly complicated recipe to make. I am someone that enjoys the little things in life, who enjoys being in one company and I do think – to a certain extent and with some exceptions– that happiness is a choice, and I always try to be happy. I am someone who can see beauty in everything, who is amazed very easily, who would genuinely be marveled by anything related to science and nature and I love being in this constant state of wonder, it is just who I am. \r\n\r\n\r\n* In a relationship: I am genuinely looking for a serious relationship, no\r\nWho Are You ?\r\n* On resume :  You are a straight m man who is 27 years old or older, you are above or 5’9, you are monogamous and you do not have kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Personality: You are a genuinely good person, you are emotionally intelligent, you are open to the idea of changing and evolving with your partner, you like taking care of your partner, you think life is beautiful, you are a bit traditional, you are empathic and caring, you like cuddling, walking and walking. You have a good credit score lol :)"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi, I’m Nate! I’m 23, straight, and male. I’m excited about finding an in-person community of people similarly enthusiastic about intellectual exploration. I love talking, hanging out in groups, and coordinating outings. Favorite activities include meeting friends at the park to invent random games involving tennis balls and frisbees, LAN parties, and foraging for wild foods. I just finished school, and I’m very location-agnostic. I’ll likely prioritize learning instead of full time work for the next year or two, although I’m open to reconsidering in order to date someone in an expensive area. Longevity is on my mind a lot, and I’ll probably end up in the field or earning to give to it. I’m currently unsure about having kids. However, I definitely want rationalism and my weird little culture to spread. \r\n\r\n\r\nI was brought up as an atheist and ancap, though I’m pretty agnostic about political philosophy now. Metaethics is a different story: I scrapped the remnants of deontology that I inherited, and I’m now a staunch non-cognitivist. However, I still feel an aversion to coercion. Separating children from their mothers and preventing them from spending most of their day playing outside and otherwise doing whatever they find interesting seems pretty horrific to me. I’m very inclined toward unschooling and aristocratic tutoring. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m open to polyamory and experimental relationship structures. I’m not a jealous person anyway, but I’m interested in seeing how novel situations affect me emotionally. I think about the evolution of emotions a lot, though that’s one of the many areas where I get caught in analysis loops and should be more empirical! On that note, I’m open to all sorts of lifestyle experiments. I’m big on Crocker’s rules, but I’ve become very interested in discussing emotions in recent years. I’m prone to existential melancholy and can be a bit dramatic, but I’m not proud of it, and I’m getting better at staying in a good mood consistently. I like snuggling. I haven’t been big on gift-giving or unsolicited acts of service in the past, but I want to improve if that’s your thing!  \r\n\r\n\r\nBesides cold, dry air-induced asthma and mild pet allergies, I’m healthy as a horse. I’m neurotypical but get along well with certain brands of autists. I love outdoor activities and playing sports, though you don’t have to.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can contact me at natestrum@rocketmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some recent pics:"

      "fullText": "﻿Welcome to this episode of MATEHUNTERS\r\nthe one hole aella couldnt fill was her heart\r\n\r\nHi I’m looking for a boy i’d like to touch. Hopefully if you know a boy i would like to touch with this will help you identify him.\r\nThings I want that most boys don’t have, roughly in order of how many boys they filter out and by how important/dealbreakery they are\r\n*open to kids maybe??? and probably doesn’t already have kids/strong life commitments\r\n*financially stable, bonus points for having more money than me\r\n*independent, not looking to spend all their time joined at hip\r\n*l i b e r t a r i a n  v i b e s\r\n*social power roughly within an order of magnitude of mine, tho doesn’t need to be same sphere\r\n*is open to risk, brave, caution is calculated, doesn’t let fear of bad outcomes affect taking life by the balls\r\n*sexually sinister\r\n*real good at [jazzhands] emotional maturity: stuff like detecting and naming emotions, having boundaries and a body, communication, “talking from the stomach”, circling skills, mind meldy moves, speaking-from-poetry-instead-of-accuracy\r\n*similar IQ range, which is higher than average but probably not as high as we’d hope\r\n*not boring? I am deeply, profoundly bored by most humans. Everyone is deeply ok as they are I just prefer to spend my time doing puzzles, which are more interesting than most humans. \r\n*accepting of self and others, at peace\r\n*good at (or at least compatible with/tolerant of) rationality n stuff, cold culture, happy to exchange money for social things, not easily horrified\r\nhow i’m poly\r\n(full-ass post here)\r\nPolyamory is very much mandatory for me, unless you’re a billionaire, because i am down to accept money in exchange for social things. For me, “poly” just means “I don’t place rules on the intimacy my partner has with others.” In practice, I tend to behave mostly romantically monogamously (prob due to lack of sufficient options i’m interested in), and I have a whole lot of casual sex and am happy to help my partners have casual sex too. I historically have been very helpful for connecting my partners with other women interested in them!\r\n\r\nIm happy to commit time/effort to joint stuff like potential kids or house or ‘relationship development time’, even if it interrupts potential future relationships with other partners.\r\nAbout Me?\r\nThe list of aella-facts is maybe less necessary cause i exhibitionist my personality loudly online into every crevice, but if you want an external list of nice things, my now-casual partner Nate Soares has a document originally entitled “My ex is a shit eating whore” which is literally true but google thought he was trying to be mean so it’s now reuploaded here, where he tells people why i am good to date.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for things about me that are maybe more nonobvious potential dealbreakers for people with specific preferences \r\n\r\n*80% cold culture\r\n*however, can embarrassingly lose all skills when emotionally activated\r\n*messy, horribly, tragically messy, but fortunately i am happy to exchange money for social things\r\n*errs on the side of avoidant\r\n*constantly dealing with stalkers you will have to protect me from\r\n*i do not like directly initiating sex almost ever (tho doesnt mean you cant have as much sex as you want)\r\n*despite playboy once describing me as having the ‘body of a thoroughbred stallion’, in practice i am gremlinesque, have computerneck, shower infrequently, and i sweat way more than normal and have very erratic poops\r\n*not even the most basic cooking skills\r\n*i like being on the computer a whole lot and dont like doing much outside stuff\r\n*not routine oriented (tho i would like to be)\r\n*do not like threesomes\r\n*don’t have the ‘girl magic’ thing that some girls have where they emanate a soft glow of feminine nurturing care\r\n*I’m not nurturing in general. I’m absentminded and am bad at tracking needs when those needs deviate significantly from my own. I still don’t remember my partners birthdays.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso generic stats: born 1992, height 5’8, live in east bay. Have eggs frozen."

      "fullText": "﻿May 2025\r\nDate me?  \r\nHello, I’m Joseph.\r\nThis is one of those documents where I try to articulate how I would make a great romantic partner while fighting the twin British urges to only ever be self-deprecating and to avoid revealing one’s emotions or inner character to anyone.\r\nA man wiser than me said that if we want the rewards of being loved, then we have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known, so, reluctantly, here goes…\r\nThe basics\r\nI am a single straight monogamous bespectacled 5’8” 31-year-old man currently living alone in West London. I am in possession, if not of a good fortune, then at least of a good sense of humour, and am in want of a partner who would eventually be my wife.\r\nI think the most concise way to describe me is as middle class and bookish. If you’re looking for a Hugh Grant/Colin Firth awkward Austen Englishman type but feel that they’re intimidatingly attractive, then today is your lucky day.\r\nFeel free to stalk my Facebook, Twitter, BlueSky, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and personal website, but I’m afraid that I don’t post very much.\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nI read all these Guardian opinion pieces about how wonderful and liberating it is to be single and I do not relate to them at all. I’m a romantic, and having a partner is very important to me.\r\nI’m looking for a kind, thoughtful person who is intellectually curious with a keen sense of fun. Ideally you’ll share my values, and we’ll have some common interests (see below), but ultimately I’m looking for a partnership where we support and learn from each other, make a continual commitment to work on our relationship, and together are more than the sum of our parts. I’m after someone to share my life with, the sublime and the ridiculous, the ordinary and the extraordinary.\r\nI think kids are great and I would ideally have 2-4, so you’re going to need to be on board with that too. I’m very aware that the burden of having a child falls disproportionately on mothers, so I’m keen to make sure that would not be the case for us. A loving relationship plus kids is a big part of what I want to get out of life, and I’d be willing to sacrifice quite a lot, including forgoing my career, in service to being a better parent and a better partner.\r\nWhat I look like\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I’m like generally\r\nThis is by far the worst bit to write. Reflecting on who you are and how you are perceived by others is a special form of torture.\r\n* Intellectually curious/a giant nerd – I like learning, I spend a lot of time thinking hard about things, and I’m interested in improving myself, my habits, and my thinking. I am easily nerd-sniped with interesting blogs, videos, Twitter threads, podcasts etc. whether about science, history, art, or how it is that Lichtenstein has avoided being eaten by its neighbours. I will want to discuss big philosophical ideas with you, as well as data and graphs, and fun factoids I’ve just learned (the Ancient Egyptian for cat is ‘meow’). Some men will tell you you’re pretty, I will tell you you’re pretty and that ‘pretty’ originally meant ‘cunning, crafty, or clever’ and has the same etymological root as prattle. What more could you want?\r\n* Cultural - There’s a Picasso quote that I love – ‘Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life’. I would like to spend more of my life appreciating and creating art and music and poetry and theatre. I’m part of a book club where we read ancient text together (the Odyssey, the Epic of Gilgamesh etc.), and I’ve recently held a poetry evening and attended a workshop on drawing and carving gothic tracery. An ideal first date would be going to an art gallery, pointing out all the art that we like, and then planning an elaborate heist.\r\n* Wholesome/earnest – I’m no good at being cool or edgy. I’m unironically enthusiastic about trying to be a good person and filling the world with plants and places to be cosy. For example, I’m 100% behind this tweet by Joy Marie Clarkson, an embodiment of wholesomeness that I can only aspire to. I want to create beautiful things in the world. Beautiful objects, events, places, and relationships.\r\n* Judgemental/arrogant – This may seem somewhat at odds with the preceding item, and in some ways it is. Basically, I try to be a nice, accepting, humble person, and then I see a Rightmove listing where someone’s decorated their entire house grey or a report with terrible data visualisation, the red mist descends, and I send my friends 27 messages detailing exactly why it’s terrible and how if only everyone were like me the world would be a lot better. Ideally you too are a slightly terrible person and also delight in privately judging people’s poor design choices.\r\n* Fun - I hesitate to describe myself as funny, that feels like a step too far even for this act of extreme self promotion, but I will say that if I think I can add some humour to a situation then I usually do. I regularly make jokes, usually really awful puns. Sometimes people laugh, sometimes they groan and ask me to leave their home and never speak to them again.\r\nSome things I like doing\r\nHopefully you like doing some of these things too, but I don’t expect us to have all the same interests.\r\n* Learning – See above\r\n* Acquiring books and sometimes reading them – I read quite a lot (though I’m not a 52 books a year kind of person). I typically have a lot of books on the go because I’ve decided I’m an adult and I get to make my own rules, and those rules do not involve having to finish my current book before starting a new one. Having an extensive library complete with ladder and secret door is definitely a life goal.\r\n* Visiting botanic gardens and other green places- I adore botanic gardens, especially ones with glasshouses. If I could live in the Palm House at Kew, I would. I try to visit botanic gardens in any place I am visiting and would ideally become so immensely wealthy that I could create my own. I am also trying to become a person who goes hiking because I enjoy nature and exploring, and I feel like I should at least try to incorporate some exercise into my life.\r\n* Visiting museums, art galleries, National Trust properties etc. – I go and see London exhibitions pretty regularly, usually classical art or history. With some persuasion I will visit the Tate Modern with as open a mind as I can manage so that you don’t think I’m a philistine. If we visit a stately home then it’s a requirement that we talk like we’re in Downton Abbey and glide gracefully down the grand staircase arm in arm.\r\n* Dancing – I go dancing once or twice a week, typically Ceroc (jive/swing) and country dancing (ceilidhing/reeling). I also did a little bit of ballroom while at university. If you want a dance partner who will occasionally step on your toes, look no further.\r\n* Making things – Usually this means digital graphic design, but sometimes I make physical things too. I have designed everything from business cards to massive conference banners for fun and profit. I particularly enjoy making spoofs of things as part of overly elaborate jokes – a Guardian-style exposé infographic about how my friends know each other, an entire website for a fake transportation firm in order to help a friend move house, a hand-illuminated manuscript about how to summon a demon to help you finish your PhD. My friends regularly come to me for hot takes on typography in wedding invitations and data visualisation choices in reports.\r\n* Listening to music - I have no musical talent or knowledge, but I listen to music pretty much all the time. I confuse the hell out of Spotify, because though I primarily listen to classical music, I’m also fond of everything from Taylor Swift, to indie bands, jazz, and Disney songs.\r\n* Playing games – Don’t worry, not with your heart. I play computer games once every few weeks with some friends, and am also up for D&D and board games (but not Monopoly, because that way lies weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth).\r\n* Working – I’m one of those people who enjoys working (in the job sense and the more generally being productive sense). I have two jobs and I always have at least three different personal projects on the go. If any of this became incompatible with also having a relationship, the relationship would be my priority.\r\nSome things I would be up for doing more of\r\nThere are a bunch of things that I could be easily persuaded to do/do more of if you were keen. This list is not exhaustive. If there’s a thing that you really like doing that you would like to do together then there’s a pretty good chance I’ll be up for it.\r\n* More cultural activities – While I like museums, galleries, concerts, the theatre etc. I don’t go to them as often as I would like because I hate going to things by myself, so if you’re a keen theatregoer or similar then I would definitely be up for going to more things.\r\n* More crafty things – I like the idea of being crafty and making actual physical things rather than just digital ones, but I need an incentive to actually do it. I’ve dabbled in drawing, painting, and calligraphy, but haven’t taken them very far yet.\r\n* More travel – I’m not very adventurous – I like the comfort of my home and I can find new environments a bit overwhelming – but if you’re keen on travel, particularly in Europe, then it would not be hard to persuade me. Experiencing the sights and smells of a market in Marrakesh or bungee jumping in Australia? Not for me. Exploring the ruins of a French château or doing a bit of the Appalachian trail? Sign me up!\r\n* More outdoor activities – I am not a naturally outdoorsy or sporty person (I’m told that trying to stay as far away as possible from the ball is not in fact the objective of football), but if, say, you’re a big fan of badminton and wanted us to play every week, then I’d be game. As mentioned above, I like hiking, I’m just not very good at doing it regularly.\r\nSome things I don’t tend to enjoy\r\n* Anything excessively adventurous or noisy - Skydiving, bungee jumping, theme parks, music festivals, wild parties, shopping malls – anywhere with a lot of people and noise is not usually good for me.\r\n* Events focused on food/alcohol - I don’t drink and I have a very low tolerance for drunk people, so pubs, bars, bottomless brunches and the like are very much not my cup of tea (though also neither is tea). I also have a disorder that restricts my diet quite a bit and makes food-focused situations a bit stressful, so if you’re someone who likes spending every weekend trying out new restaurants then I’m afraid it’s unlikely to work between us. To be clear though, that doesn’t mean I’d be at all opposed to you drinking or us going to restaurants on occasion.\r\n* Reality TV – I really can’t stand Love Island and its ilk. Quite apart from being deeply uninteresting to me (see earlier point about being judgemental), I think it brings out and glorifies the worst in people in ways that have serious and lasting repercussions for our society.\r\n* Animals – I’m not an animal person. I smile politely when people start talking about their cat’s antics, and I will gingerly pat a dog if I can see no other way to get out of the situation, but that’s about as far as I’ll go. If you have a particularly adorable and non-threatening animal companion and we are otherwise highly compatible then I might be persuaded.\r\nMy home aesthetics\r\nI won’t show you what my flat looks like because, you know, this is the internet, but below are some examples from my Pinterest home decor board to give you an indication of how many books, plants, and pieces of art I feel is appropriate in a home (though sadly my flat does not look this nice yet). If you think otherwise, I’m willing to be convinced.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nHow I would woo you\r\nIf you’ve got this far I feel like that’s a good sign. Here are some of the ways I would try to seal the deal:\r\n* Listening to you – You know quite a lot about me by this point, so I have some catching up to do. I want to hear what you’re passionate about and learn from you. I will also try to learn your habits/preferences: how you like your tea, how quickly you like responses to your texts, etc. Listening is also the basis for good communication, and good communication is the basis for a healthy relationship, so I will really try very hard on this point.\r\n* Treating you with respect – I’ll never give you up, let you down, run around, or desert you. But seriously, I’m a committed feminist and I’m looking for a relationship of equals based on honesty, trust, and respect. Please call me out immediately if I am ever not treating you with respect.\r\n* Making you laugh – I will make jokes, I will do silly things, I will pull silly faces. If we encounter any highland cows I will attempt to communicate with them by mooing in a Scottish accent. If you tell me you’re hungry, then I will almost certainly respond that I’m the Czech Republic. I will treat laughter and groans as equal indicators of success.\r\n* Sharing things I think you’ll find interesting – I’ll send you articles, Tweets, artwork, memes, music etc. that I think you might enjoy. It’s my way of showing that I’m thinking about you and trying to bring you some joy.\r\n* Buying you gifts, but erratically – I think bad gifts are a plague. This means that I’ll put a lot of effort into trying to come up with good gifts, but also I’ll ignore deadlines like Christmas and birthdays and instead give you something on a random Tuesday in May when it happens to be ready.\r\n* Defending your honour – Inducing the cad who has run off with your younger sister to marry her, thus saving your family from social disgrace.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf it sounds like we might be compatible, then my preferred way of signalling interest is to make eye contact on the tube and then panic and get off early. So far that’s not been very successful, so it’s probably better if you fill in this form, or find some other way to advise me of your interest.\r\nIf you’re not interested in me romantically but think that we might be friends then I might be interested in that too. If you have a friend who you think would be a good fit for me, then I would be extremely grateful if you would please share this document with them."

      "fullText": "﻿Original posted on a personals subreddit in January 2022.\r\nContact: date.mark.1co4i@simplelogin.com \r\n—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it is courtesy here to apologize for lengthy posts. I can tell you that there's no tl;dr; I hope that scrolling down something would catch your eye, and if I'm lucky, having read a paragraph enticed you to read more. I have very roughly tried to progress from the general to the particular; we know that the devil is in the details but it is the context that imbues it with significance. Words can only do so much to give a sense of a person, and I can hardly imagine a more anonymous place than a personals subreddit. If I may quote from a writer reflecting on his time as a drafted Vietnam war soldier,\r\n\r\n\r\n> I confess that a large number of Americans I met in the Army amazed me by their differentness. I had not known their like before, nor have I met them since. Nothing else could have made me realize how narrow the circle in which we move in peacetime is. Most of us hardly get an inkling of how ninety per cent of our fellows live or think. Naively we assume that they must be like us or not very different.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what is true about the American draft might be yet truer to the vast internet? Or is the variance narrower in Berlin?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy intention here is to give you as much sense of my person without you yet having met me. To read this fully will take you longer than reading other here ads, but less than riding the bike or U-Bahn to meet me, a ride that can be spared if you find something off in here lines from the comfort of your home or phone. If both of us are lucky, perhaps, on the contrary, it would give rise to that ride at the end of which two people, who did not know they missed each other, find each other and share a pleasant evening. And if we are very lucky, perhaps share many days thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a Russia-born, Israel-raised, 33 y/o (since two days!) who came to Berlin in 2014 for a master's and stayed here for work. A bit of an over-thinker, I love musing about and discussing the little and big things: how expectations shape our perception, how perception shapes our understanding of ourselves and the world; how attitudes are formed and how a given culture arises. The human mind, animal behaviour, culture, language, our political and economic system & its history have fascinated me since many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor my bachelor's I studied math and physics. The reason I chose that major was admittedly rather hoity-toity: I can't say it was the subject I was most interested in, but it was among the subject I was interested in and the one that, I thought, would be the most difficult to learn without others to guide me, i.e., teachers. The institution was a so called \"liberal arts college\" in the US and I took ample advantage of the opportunity to take courses outside my major, as well as going so far as borrowing text-books in the library to read over the summer; textbooks about social and evolutionary psychology and behavioural biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started my master's for the \"wrong reasons\". By the last year of my bachelor's I was set to be done with academics and \"start real life\" (as if the term bore significance); I had wanted to leave Israel and to move to Europe. Seeing that it was too complicated to do so otherwise I chose what appeared to be the easiest route in: to start studying there. Since high-school I had had a particular attraction towards Germany, I think because of my Volga-German paternal grandfather who died before I was born, and because my favourite aunt lives in the city, but not wanting to narrow my choices I cast my net broadly, and so I could say I was lucky to find an intriguing program ausgerechnet in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unexpected googling result, the program was in \"computational neuroscience,\" a term I did not know and which I had still not understood after reading its Wikipedia entry, but which, I thought, matched my case: the \"computational\" part matched my educational background and the \"neuroscience\" part matched my interest in the relationship between mind & body and the biological underpinning of human behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program was difficult for me, for reasons that were personal (having looked too much outside my major during my bachelor's, making me somewhat less prepared than others; being used to a different student-professor relationship) and circumstantially unfortunate (not having been prepared for how difficult and time consuming finding a WG in my budget was, which itself brought further hardships), but I finished in good time. This \"good time\" was a long while, longer than programmed, but on par with my peers. As a classmate and friend had said, that it was a 2-years program was a lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy studies were followed by a long and therefore difficult period of job searching, looking for a position as a data-scientist, elongated by my difficulties with German (which since then I speak much better, also in my job), uncertainties about fine points of my then legal status in the country, and mostly by having little connections in Berlin and by being a bad judge of my own skills and abilities, always leaning diffidence-wards. Nonetheless I felt lucky at the end when ––being ready to sell myself to any evil corporation to optimize its commercials or recommendations–– I got a job at a \"medical-tech\" company which employs machine learning to improve diagnostics of health complications during pregnancies. While I was hired as a data scientist, in the last few months, our team being understaffed, I did nothing but implement changes to our app. At least in our company xmas dinner the head of tech voiced that I was over qualified for the work that I was doing and the boss encouraged him to get me out of that and put me on the data as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommitment to writing\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this day whenever I see a great piece of art, whatever the form ––literature, film, paintings, music, video games, furniture––, I'm attracted by the idea of creating something similar, rarely going beyond the act of sketching blue-prints for future projects. What has stuck, however, is the decision I made when I was about 15, that I shall be a writer. For a very long time I had not been much of a writer and was reluctant using that title. I wrote mostly short story beginnings and fragments; I was surprised to find years later that these were not so bad, but all the same they didn't amount to much. When I first came to the US I remember telling others that I would never be able to speak English from the heart, but by a year or so later it had changed, and English is still my language of choice. A creative writing professor on my final year was very supportive; I used to think that she was merely nice, that is, to everyone, but later I heard different experiences from other students. All the same, perhaps I received special treatment as the odd non-literature student. All the same, it was encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy passion is in writing fiction, but I discovered the power of my writing to captivate people (as I hereby try to captivate you) on mundane occasions: emails to a different literature professor, about how I had found it difficult to keep up with the reading, who praised them during class(!) (they were written in an 18th century English, appropriately to the course); an excuse email to a tutor in my master's, for having failed to submit my homework, who wrote me back that I had made her day; personal and philosophizing ––and often admittedly too long–– emails to friends, one of which had asked to forward an email to two friends of hers because she thought \"it would help them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while I was also writing the occasional not very good short story, sending it to one journal I had set my mind on, which has never accepted my submissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a minor breakthrough a few years ago, when I answered an ad recruiting team members to work on a so called indie video game. \"Writers\" were not sought but I found the ad intriguing and contacted the guy anyway, expressing my interest. We had some back and forth, he presented me his idea on a call and I wrote him back my opinion of the project. I expected our connection to end then and there: I was very critical of many aspects of his work, and us being strangers, I thought he would want to not have anything to do with me anymore. I was critical not because I wanted to bring him down or insult him, but precisely because I liked the guy and his attitude and so cared enough to take the time, risk the \"being not nice\" in order to share my point of view. He wrote me back to say that he found my comments helpful, and from then on we collaborated. When I told him that I no longer had time for his project (this was during my job-searching period; my time went to answering postings and on making myself qualified for the positions I was seeking), he offered to pay me to write for his game  –– an offer I accepted. So I may say that I have been paid for my writing, I almost forgot about it. The breakthrough came from the fact that his approach to story-telling/ sharing ideas, let's say, was very akin to mine, and seeing it from the outside I became aware of its shortcomings, storytelling-wise.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust over a year ago I had the last of piecemeal revelations which brought about a major leap. After involving a good friend of mine in my endeavour, I began to write regularly, daily, with clear aims before me. My new expedient attitude had set me to write short stories but my expansive nature (a hint of which you might be picking up) proved to me that I am more of a (potential) novelist. I'm currently working on a novel and I am glad to announce that it has been progressing very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & honesty\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a great part of my life I held honesty (being true) and openness (being transparent) to be prime virtues. These served me well:\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen I was drafted to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, I was put into artillery, a combat unit. While I enjoyed the training (truly a \"guilty pleasure\"), when it came to being part of maintaining the occupation, I couldn't do it. I asked my direct commander for a conversation and laid it out to him: I didn't believe in this and that, refused to continue cooperating, and explicitly expressed my willingness to go to military prison if my words amounted to insubordination. I was surprised to find that the commander ––whose very different political leaning/ worldview was known (I was amused when he told me that his girlfriend was \"just like that, too\")–– responded very graciously. The rest of the story is rather involved to lay down here completely, but the bottom line was that honesty received its points. I approached my problem with words and it was rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there was the matter already written here, about coming to my teachers and making explicit my shortcomings as a student, which were always met with support. I also wouldn't forget how in high-school a good friend of mine came to the math teacher with his graded exam and showed her how one of his solutions, despite a mistake he had made, was marked as correct. She answered that he was right that he was wrong, but let him keep the grade. Together with other friends I remonstrated, though only in jest, we respected his action.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally with my friends I always found that opening up yielded positive results. I wouldn't forget how towards the end of my second year of college my roommate wrote me a long Facebook message where he expressed a resentment he had towards me, to which thitherto I was unaware, mentioning that \"[I] remembered how you told me once that it's better to talk about issues rather then holding on to it, so I thought it would be good for us to talk about it.\" He vented his grudges, I apologized, we discussed it and sorted it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I have also experienced the limits of honesty. My tête-à-têtes with commanders buoyed up the ranks up to the battalion commander who did not, like the others, simply hear me out, but \"argued\" with me. After that conversation I deliberated with myself about whether in some circumstances \"lying was ok.\" Recognizing the shortness of the power of my words, I resorted to action –– which despite the military settings and my internal sense of drama, did not involve helicopters, shooting or explosions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in college I told my Nabokov course professor that I couldn't, that is, wouldn't, write the final paper for the course because I had a greater calling (my then novel in writing) and she gave me the grade that I deserved, adjusted by sympathies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my long job-searching period my honest but implicit importing of my lack of ability to assess the comparison between my relevant skillfulness with that of the imagined potential competition's might have been taken as an expression of a lack of aptness in the skills themselves, or so one could imagine. And so I did imagine, along with hundreds other stories of why it was that I wasn't getting a job (none of which, though you probably didn't think so, had to do with immigrants).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the army I was trying to \"follow the rules\", to follow my agreeable nature <3, while not following them. I now wonder that there was an effect that was as paradoxical as that in the liar's paradox. I observed once a soldier being immediately punished upon his refusal to pick up a shell during drilling (I now wonder if I had been anything to inspire; it was after my disobedient \"coming out\" and I was passing by him), a response very different to the one I had received. My refusal bore the structure of \"I thereby break the rule,\" and had the effect of excusing myself from all that I did not want to do while being dealt with as if I was operating within the rules. For a long period I was let to merely \"hang around\", only being assigned only cleaning and watch duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my Nabokov course professor I was being honest when I told her that I wanted to dedicate the time to my fiction project, but I was in fact also proving myself a point, namely, that I was free from the expectations of institutions, or, more exactly, that I came to school to learn and not to be accredited, and since I was not going to continue on the academic path (which turned to be false) my final grades were not important and putting the effort to prove a professor that I deserved her good opinion and thereby sacrificing my art(!!) was plain silly. And perhaps I wanted her to think of me as a bud of something as great as Nabokov. And also I was trying to repeat a trick that did work for me in Freshman year (A; but there was more heart in it) than in that senior year (C; if I recall correctly).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of the above? It is not the case that honesty per se has rendered me a disservice, but rather that being honest is not always very trivial. For one thing, words do not merely carry the information they directly encode, but establish a certain relationship between the speaker and recipient. As you are reading it, presumably, you are not building a picture of myself based just on the content of my words, but also on my choice of things to include, their order, what I exclude. You might wonder, to put it simply, why I am telling you certain things.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is the reason why I enjoy having \"theoretical discussions\" with people with Asperger's or who are close to \"that end of the spectrum\"; from my experience they don't take their opinions so personally so when I disagree with them they don't take it to mean that \"I dislike them\" or that \"we do not get along\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon which seems to me to best capture the dynamic between words and the relationship they engender between the people using them is that of flirting. And I think what is true with flirting, in a long but circumscribed moment between two persons, is true for all interpersonal communications and their Wittgensteinian language games.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the flirters do? There's a play that is not merely about reflecting reality as one sees it but about negotiating, implicitly, the creation of a new reality: the potential transformation of a \"one and a one\" into \"a two\" into a different kind of \"one\"; the flirters bring in their expectations of the nature of this new unit, they bring in their expectations of the expectations of the other person, they discuss the unit, they gauge the other's willingness and adequateness and entice the other into the unit by proving that they are fit for their own part. There's always the question: is the other merely a nice person, that is, nice to everybody, or specifically nice to me? Is this person habitually touchy or are they hitting on me? Does the other person tell me about their recent break up because they have an urge to share the fresh experience? Because they want advice? Because they want to communicate to me their availability?\r\n\r\n\r\nA memory of non-flirting comes to my mind. I was at a Berlin lake's beach. A small group of cheerful gals was sitting on the next spot. A guy, who evidently had had some interaction with them earlier, approached and spoke to one of them. He said that he was new in the city, that he didn't know much people, and asked if she would be his friend, wanted to exchange numbers. I had a perfect view of this interaction, and I suspected that the naive and simple approach was a poorly disguised trick, that he was trying to pick her up, and the gal, who was not born yesterday, must have suspected likewise. As you might imagine, the gal declined his kind offer and after a bit of insistence the guy left. What works in kindergarten (and in A Beautiful Mind) often doesn't work in the adult world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI admit that, unfortunately, I'm not good at flirting, but I recognize that while words can try to describe that which happens between one person and another, they cannot define it, cannot conjure it out of nothingness by themselves. It seems to me that people don't even always know what they themselves want, and if they do, they don't know what they might desire in the future, after they discover something or their circumstances change. Words are a combination of bearing witness to the present, reporting on the past and making a prediction, or a promise, onto the future, and therein their ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do we remain honest, report things about ourselves as they are, when we are aware that we are constantly changing? When we know that we continue to disappoint our own selves? When we know, perhaps, that our self disappointment is a sign that we had set ourselves high-bars that we worked hard to strive towards, without which we would have remained lying on the bottom? How do we promise \"eternal love\" when we have no regard for any church's allotted sanctity and we witness divorces as a normal occurrence around us, and know that we, too, are only human?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you understand, this is not a call for dishonesty, lack of commitment or the abandoning of communication of needs and expectations. It is not the case that I think that words are meaningless or that \"there's no truth\" (I'm already answering protractors, but I trust that you understand me). No. This is a petition to act out a relationship between us\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere language is used to improve each other's and our surrounding's lives and conditions –– I don't mean that we will fix the world with words, but that we won't violently force words upon it, or argue about words as if they were the matter themselves;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere we employ language as a tool to understand each other and not to bind each other, committed to the idea that each one of us has one's needs, desires, energies and fancies that need to be humoured and supported in our effort of maintaining our togetherness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it has not been yet stated quite so unequivocally: I am looking for a single woman to form a dyad with, to give meaning to each other with, to figure out the world with, and when the world is ready for it, raise some children with. There. This last part goes somewhat against what I mentioned when on the topic of flirting, but as there are people who are certain they do not want to have children it made sense to mention it. But that would anyhow be in the far future, and we do not need to discuss it yet. We take it all in baby-steps. We are considerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & Shyness\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the big drama of my adolescence. When I was 12 I realized that I was shy. It's seems funny to me that such things have to be learned, but there's no escape from the fact that when we are born we do not \"know ourselves,\" in the most trivial sense, and need time to be discovered to our own selves. Need \"time\" meaning the occasion for the discovery; in my case it was watching the series Neon Genesis Evangelion with its timid protagonist Shinji. It incited an interest in psychology, which the then young internet (pre-google!) led me to believe equaled Freud's Id and Ego and the rest of it. I diagnosed myself with \"social phobia\", a recognition with which I turned with glee, as if I had solved a great mystery, to others: to classmates on MSN messenger, with whom I hadn't otherwise spoken in school, who listened; to my friends, one of which mocked my diagnosis and denied it. Be as it may, I found out soon enough, on a classmate's Bar Mitzvah party, that being aware of a problem is not quite 80% of having solved it, and that while Shinji supposedly overcame his issues on the last episode I had watched that same day, he did it alone ––– without me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked my parents to take me to the therapist, which they did. I remember drawing a boy, describing it, and being shy about drawing a girl. This sounds caricaturistic, but I remember being given the Rorschach test, and describing a scene of two alien kingdoms sealing an accord of peace with the touch of their leaders' long index-fingers ––– a scene that upon searching it years later, though having found the implicated Card X, I couldn't again see. At a trough I was suggested antidepressants and I must have hinted willingness because next the psychiatrist and my parents appeared; I also remember that the offer was left to me to decide (by the staff? by my parents? unaware of it when young, I was almost amazed when I reflected on it as an adult at the degree of trust my parents had always put in me) and that I declined it. I don't remember how long I attended sessions; it was at least a few months and less than a year. I had gotten some insights out of it but eventually decided that I felt like it was not helping me much, and I was out. This, by the way, was the last time that I sought \"professional help\" for \"mental health\" related issues, though not the last time that I suffered of anything of that sort. That being said, while still occasionally having been afflicted with depression afterwards, I am happy to say that since my early twenties I have learned to cope with the little devils in my head and since two years they are positively gone (without, as Rilke has put it, the angels having fled with them).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout my adolescence I invested a lot of thought into my problem of shyness, and what brought the eventual succour was a simple change of circumstances. For 9 years I had attended the same school, the same class of 40 kids, and the simple transition to a different school, when high-school came around, and its requirement to make new acquaintances, was of great help. I did not make it very easy for it to do so, however: in my high-school the classes were reshuffled every year, with the exception of two: one which was \"special\" in the euphemistic sense (but not too special; I think it was called the \"sports class\") and the other was the gifted class. I tell you right away that I had not undergone any tests to get into the latter. When I came to register for high-school ––I remember being alone with the secretary in her office–– I said that I wanted to be in gifted class. That was enough to get admission. It's one thing with young rosy cheeked children, I suppose a teenager's willingness alone, in that angsty age, is enough of a criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in high-school I put myself in one \"extreme\" of being again in the same class and its group of students all-throughout, the army (which is a whole story on its own) was on the other: already mid-training I had been moved from one unit to another, a pattern that continued until my discharge with a rough average of one month per unit, having to make new acquaintances on each transition. It was during this time, incidentally, that the seeds of my affection towards FKK had been sown; it made as much sense to go to the showers together as it did to go to dinner together. Why shower alone when you can shower and have a conversation at the same time? This idea comes to me now for the first time in my life: let's have two showers. Make it big, give it two showerheads, so we could shower together. Tongue in the cheek but serious nonetheless!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army was the beginning of the end of my problem. I know that in college I still considered myself an introvert because a TED talk about introverts inspired me to follow the advice of \"taking advantage of what introverts were good at\" (I'm paraphrasing) and \"express myself in writing rather than face to face\" to tackle an uncertainty that I had in the wooing of my then crush. I copied (unnecessarily, though it felt more personal that way) in handwriting a long letter that I composed for her. That I ended up awake until four in the morning was because of the calligraphy I rendered on the front page, which I thought was not so bad for a first attempt. This, as you might imagine, did not work so well, and was hinged partially on the misguided sense that a romantic relationship could be agreed on when in fact it should be developed. And on my impatience, perhaps. If it was the first then I admit it was not the last of grand gestures made thus by me for such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen sonnets that I wrote to a stranger who had twitted \"Pablo Neruda wrote a hundred sonnets to his wife while I can't get a guy to go to acro yoga with me idgi\" won me a phone number + a reserved willingness to meet for coffee, but either my apologetic reply email or my stumblings on our short WhatsApp correspondence made her turn the other cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen was a long half love letter half Ode to Berlin written to an Ok-Cupid connection. We had corresponded extensively on the days preceding her visit to Berlin, had a skype and hung out a couple of times while she was here. I sent her the email while she was travelling in Hungary after Berlin. Well: she didn't want to have anything with me afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have learned my lesson, alluded to on the previous section about words and honesty, and that Ode to Berlin was the last time I attempted anything of this sort. I am not unaware that this here post is of the same genre, me jumping around, feeling like a bird of paradise trying to captivate your attention and pique your interest. However, this time I do not pretend that I know who you are, nor what sort of relationship we might develop together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy have I written so much? Am I desperate? Crazy? Obsessed?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not desperate, but concerned. Indeed, my self sufficiently leads me to believe that if I do not do anything about it, I could easily go through life by myself. A good friend joked that I was preparing for the covid situation all of my life. Indeed, I am not unhappy alone but I am often sad that I do not share my life with more people. And my wish to make a family one day is dear to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrazy? Maybe a little but not in disconcerting ways. I have, anyhow, encouraged others' notion of myself as being a little fou fou; people start to expect the unexpected, in little ways, which means that they do not quite judge me by their usual standards, which is liberating. Or this is how I have explained it to myself; perhaps they do judge me all the same within themselves but they have not complained and I am happy to beat my own drum.\r\n\r\n\r\nObsessive? Maybe. It took me a good decade and a half to cultivate a passion for writing, and it is there that my obsession perhaps lies; it is no less powerful for being self-made. As it may be, I enjoy writing, telling stories, sharing my ideas and, most of all: having conversations, for which writing could hopefully at least (but also: only so much) set a table. As Yoel Hoffmann wrote in \"Curriculum Vitae\":\r\n\r\n\r\n> If I could [in a sort of pact that was deeper than that between an author and a reader] fall on the necks of people and tell them: come and let us sit and steep tea and drink and you will tell me your life and I will tell you my life, I would have tossed the manuscript in the paper bin and done it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I see it, I'm just trying to present myself and attract the like minded. I'm not trying to dance the tango alone. This post is not the final word but the excuse, the occasion, to discuss things. Any written word, anyhow, can remain valid only so long. This is just the beginning, as Melannie C sings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of college I was no longer sure how valid my former placement of myself on the introvert-extrovert scale was, important only as a function of my interest in the so called Big Five Model. I have been enthusiastic and talkative in companies I cared about since childhood, only it took a couple of decades for me to find myself comfortable with people I had just met. Consulting Wikipedia, I'd say I suppose I am indeed an introvert, only the social aspects don't quite apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of the long way it had taken me, this is something I am proud of to the point of bragging about it:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first came to college I held the childish bratty opinion that people who danced were shallow and stupid. A year and a half later I sought to \"learn to dance\": I asked a roommate and a friend about it; the one told me that he didn't actually know how to dance (I thought otherwise) and that he had always felt ashamed whenever he went to clubs where were good dancers; the other told me to make love to the music. With this information and with the simple yet very useful Wikihow instructions on the topic(!) (ask me about it; I bet it has changed since then. Now it probably includes the steps \"stay hydrated\" and \"eat fresh fruit\") I gradually came to the present point where dancing is one of my favourite things to do. Unfortunately these plague days have not offered much opportunity to dance with other people, though I do it from time to time alone in my room. And the braggy part: already then a friend told me that I was the best dancer in our college, which I thought was a mighty exaggeration but I took it anyway. Since then almost every time that I dance in public, at night (I guess people have to be at least a little tozy-mozy), a stranger(!) would approach me to compliment my dancing. Once a person came to me and handed me a flower \"for the best dancer on the dancefloor.\" Among my circles enthusiastic dancers are not so common, so I welcome getting know people with this passion :) But as I said, most of the people I like are not keen dancers, so that's fine, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first dialogues that I ever came up with, even though I didn't write them down, were a direct consequence of my shyness. On the afternoon that serves as the best example, I was working myself up to call to book tickets for games on a then forthcoming RPG conference. I couldn't, in my anxiety, just pick up the phone and call. Instead, I imagined the interaction, playing through the various possible sequences of the imminent exchange, depending on whether there were still seats on this or that game, all the while pacing my room back and forth. Possibly it had taken an hour until I did manage to make the call.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference was not very easy, nonetheless; I find amusing the notion of being shy/awkward within a gathering for playing pen and paper RPG, stereotypically perhaps the geekiest of activities. Having been an outlier age-wise in the conference (still in middle-school, not sure what year this was), did nothing to improve. Towards the end of one of the games attention was turned to me; this was an act of kindness by one Idit ––I knew her as a personality on the Israeli RPG forum–– who wanted to include the thitherto quiet player. I became flustered and I felt my cheeks growing warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of my shyness that has to do with my writing, as well as with the attitude I have developed towards \"honesty\", was a fear ––if that's the right word–– of lying. Equipped with an inaccurate theory of mind, it seemed to me that any potential lie was obvious in its deviation from the truth. It occurred to me recently that fiction writers are really professional lie-yarners. My shying away from \"being caught lying\" had made fiction writing difficult to me, but at the same time, I believe, it leads me to write better. I carefully scrutinize all I write and it helps making the text hold better together.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFiction writers make a certain implicit ceremony, like shamans summoning spirits to possess them, before they begin their narration (and when they don't, as was the case with \"A Million Little Pieces\", things do not remain quiet), and we do not take their words at face value. Nonetheless, it's precisely the extent to which their stories ring true that we enjoy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & Sex\r\n\r\n\r\nIf hunger can be the excuse or opportunity to create something beautifully tasty, so can be the urges of the loins. While I esteem some of Buddhism's ideas regarding wanting & suffering, I think life is to be enjoyed. Perhaps am an epicurean, in the sense of valuing the cultivated pleasure, but maybe that's just hot air. I think life should be enjoyed –– the generality of this sort of sentence's amounts to be meaningless without some context, but I don't know that I could articulate it. Godard films spring to my mind, perhaps due to my idea of the French idea of joi de vivre, though I can't say I recall Belmondo ever playing anybody who particularly enjoyed life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to give you the wrong impression that my life is full of indulgent sensuality and excitement. I love hiking but I do not do it often, and if you find me in the jungle with a knife in my teeth, it is likely to be in imagination and not in body. I would have loved to be surrounded by harpists and marble, eating oysters inside a warm milk bath, but I choose my battles: on can have some but not all pleasures the world has to offer, and I'm mostly aiming at a different category. A year or two ago I did fix myself a hot bath and read in it. The effort, aggravated by the fact that the boiler's volume was smaller than the bathtub's, that the water cooled down rather quickly, that there was scarcely a dry place to put the book down on, made it not worth it. And still I repeated this once or even twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think our fancies should be obliged!\r\n\r\n\r\nI think what I value most is the pursuit of art and science, which I find to be close kin of each other rather than the polar opposites they often portrayed as. Let us invest our resources into meeting our needs, into sustaining ourselves, and the rest into creating the true and beautiful, whether taken by our senses or by our thoughts –– or, as often is the case, by their combination. Sounds lofty, I suppose, but a good direction to go in. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy French friends might look askance at me saying it, but I take some care to eat tastily. And when I make food for others I try to make it beautiful. I would not forget how my father (who has never cooked) heated up in the microwave for my return from school a simple dish of rice and toppings that my mom had made, and presented it as \"The seven samurai climbing up a snowy mountain\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hold the above all the more so with regards to sex since in it, in a sense, we consume each other, and therefore take the relish personally. One could either gobble up potatoes to kill one's stomach rumbles, or take the most out of a meal by using it to express care, explore the senses, keep oneself healthy and in love with life. I call for sex to be used to relieve each other's stresses, to let us understand each other's and our own bodies better, learn our pains and pleasures. I would not have said it if I didn't get the idea that some view it differently, but in sex I had relished nothing more than the expressions of pleasure of my partner. My own little death, if you allow me, is almost a disappointment, like the end of a good movie that is bound to come but oh how we wish there was more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, sex could be used to negotiate and to come in terms with each other: sex is but a special case, the case where it is most obvious that our requirements are asymmetrical. What is fair? 1:1 can be fair but so could 3:1. This depends on how we measure fairness, which could hark back to the old but ever present economical question of \"what is value\". Does it depend on the intensity of the need, of the satisfaction, of the effort to bring it? I say: let us be generous, to ourselves and each other, in sex and otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosting this ad\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like it's not the place, but nonetheless I want to start with a technological lament. Perhaps you are familiar with it, perhaps not: OK-Cupid, a little more than five years ago, was a great tool. I met through it my last girlfriend, I've met one of my still best friends, and had numerous other nice interactions. I found its q&a based \"match\" calculations to be neat and helpful. Since then it has been sold and transformed into an awful Tinder-like slot machine. This has nothing to do with the present ad, but: I certainly think that the world needs to have such a platform recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth though I still have an account there and if you do too, we could look at the percentage. Perhaps we are the kind that trust that math.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking for a job my finances were so stringent that it made me often eschew even going out with friends, to say nothing of dating. I had a real sense of lying outside society by the void in my pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that it is not a consideration, society is amidst a plague. My employment straddles its very beginning: I was offered my job before \"Corona\" meant anybody anything but a beer, and signed the contract with a mask and disinfected hands. Between these two points was a dramatic suspense. The confirmation of the project's budget by the Charité was delaying and I worried that money would be redirected to virus-related research, of which our project was not one, leaving my own travails ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince a couple of months I've joined a few meetup book-clubs and already made a friend, and then came the great new surge of covid cases that pushed people back to online meetings. Well, you know the situation, I don't need to tell you about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fancifully hopeful intention is to be able to make a connection, like magic, through these here words. I say \"like magic\" not just because the effect would be brought up by a spell, but because the effect itself is akin to the sudden appearance of something out of nothing, like a pigeon inside a hat. I'm thinking here of Hannah Arendt and her writing (which I hold very dear), and how she formulated the coming into the world of people as the emergence of the New. She was referring to birth, but it applies to new connections just the same –– a person emerging into the world of another. With all respect to \"Recommended to you\" algorithms, is there any occurrence more transformative and opening than the meeting and the engagement with a like minded stranger? Yes, my hopes are lofty but all the same worthy of the effort. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is explicitly an ad to find a partner, but I would be happy to make new friends of any gender as well, so if you are not looking, taken or already interested in me only otherwise, I encourage you to write me too. It's all very far from it, but I have had fantasies of living in a Seinfeld-world where friendly faces barged through the door unbidden. College was a little like this, and though at each moment I did not welcome unwelcome barging-ins, I knew that it made life better. I'm in Berlin, as the title has it, and though I recognize that our contact would begin and incubate online, my hope is that sooner than later we would sit around a shared table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't expect things to happen quickly. As mentioned before, this is just the beginning. Love, as I see it, is not about \"finding the right one,\" but about finding someone with whom to earn each other's trust to cultivate together a shared life. I'm thinking here of Alain de Botton's idea of \"Lovers needing to be each other's teachers\". One doesn't find love but grows it. A paragraph from Williams' Stoner comes to mind, too:\r\n\r\n\r\n> In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is stepping somewhat ahead, but in case it might be on your mind: I don't feel strongly rooted in Berlin. I have ogled the north and I can imagine an eventuality of myself moving to settle elsewhere, but at the same time I don't currently have a reason to do so. Learning German did make me break sweat, but no matter. Loving languages I'd be glad for a good reason to learn a new one. I'll learn yours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn appendix of books and movies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest ––from here down–– is much less important, and is provided for the sake of further self-description (to the extent such things testify) and maybe an opportunity for discussion –– some things I recently watched, read, listened to. I'll be glad to take your recommendations and opinions of recent things you stumbled upon :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI listen quite a lot to youtube videos whose audio I scrape, mostly talks and lectures. Podcast I've been listening recently to are Andrew Huberman's *Huberman Lab* podcast (I'd describe it as \"applied neuroscience\"; he's very careful with the statements he makes and has a nice voice) and David Harvey's *Anti-Capitalist Chronicles*. I used to listen to quite a lot of Zizek in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent films:\r\n\r\n\r\n*The French Dispatch*. Because I love Wes Anderson, admire his attention to detail, I'm hesitant to say that I liked this film but was a little disappointed. I liked it less than any of his others. At the same time, he was experimental here in ways new to him and there's one thing that ––to me significant–– distinguishes it from him previous work, so I tell myself that it's a turning point for him and he needs time to find his new vision. It's also possible that I'd like it better on a second viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n*My Octopus Teacher*. I didn't like the narration, nor the style of the film, but I found it interesting. More than it taught me something about octopuses, it taught me about humans.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Never look away*/ *Werk ohne Autor* – loved it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaundry list of other recent movies I watched and loved: *Dolor y Gloria* (Pain and Glory); *Брат* 1 and 2; *Microhabitat*; *Gespenster* (Ghosts); *Krótki film o miłości*; *Wife of a Spy*; *Pirosmani*.\r\n\r\n\r\nI no longer see \"favourite\" to be very useful a term in this context, but for whatever it's worth, for a long time I considered *Lost in Translation* to be my favourite film. I remember when I first saw a poster for it, though I first watched it much later, when it came out on DVD. The attention the poster evoked in me probably has to do with the title and my then Japanophilia –– the title was translated in Hebrew to \"Lost in Tokyo\"; is this irony or art? Later \"my favourite\" became \"Adaptation\", which I find very close to my heart. Either way, I'm looking forward for Sophia Coppola's and for Charlie Kaufman's next films. As well as those of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks: the last book I read was *Cloud Atlas*. It was recommended by my aforementioned encouraging writing teacher, years ago, and had long stood on my shelf unattended. For some reason I thought I wouldn't like it (that there was a film based on it probably had, I must admit, something to do with it) but I was quickly captivated once I started. I loved it. Also, recently:\r\n\r\n\r\nAuster's *The New York Trilogy*, which I loved (and have too much to say about).\r\n\r\n\r\nI read most of Franzen's *Crossroads* but abandoned it towards the end. I had enjoyed it enough that if it was not the first of three installments I would have finished it. It's greatest offense was being under-edited (look who's talking, you might say!) and so I didn't care to go on. I did love his *The Corrections*, however. Generally, I'm trying to cultivate the habit of abandoning books that I don't enjoy and whose only promise is a sense of completion by their end.\r\n\r\n\r\nI loved Morrison's *Beloved*; Ishiguro's *Never Let me Go*; Plath's *The Bell Jar*.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad ambiguous feelings towards Zalkow's *a brilliant novel in the works*.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust started McEwan's *On Chesil Beach*, loving it so far; am at the midst of Mazzucato's *The Value of Everything*, finding it very informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since my WG turned into a Zweck WG (planning to move out) where I'm the only one eating at the kitchen, on days I work from home, I watch series. Currently watching *Breaking Bad* and *BoJack Horseman*, loving the latter in particular. Loved *Rick and Morty* (but who doesn't?) until that season when it wasn't it anymore. I suspect *The Wire* will nonetheless forever stand at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I do programming I like to listen to fast paced loud music such as that of Ling Tosite Sigure, Lightning Bolt, Igorrr. When I want to fondle my ears I listen to Animal Collective, Do Make Say Think, Amon Tobin, Mr. Bungle. The advice given to Charlie in *Adaptation* is \"wow them at the end\", but when I finish personals ads I end on a melancholic note."

I'm open to both monogamous and polyamorous relationships.\n(More photos\nhere\n.)\nWhat I Want\nI’m attempting to live with an\nopen heart\n, robust ethics, and scrupulous epistemic standards.\nI want relationships, romantic or platonic, that are about helping me become wiser, more competent, and more ethical, and/or helping people who I like and respect become better by their own lights.\nMy favorite people tend to be extremely hardcore Effective Altruists, monastics that have sworn a vow of service to all life, and highly emotionally-attuned vegan therapists.\nI'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship:\na low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the one hand,\nand a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the other.\nWeekly-ish companionship\nCurrently, I’m mainly looking for more companionship in my life.\nI would like to have someone to spend time with about once a week: talking, circling, cuddling, having sex, being curious together, all with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other about our desires and our relationship.\nThis kind of relationship amounts to approximately what poly people call a \"secondary partnership\": emotionally intimate, but not the primary structure of one's life. This might work best for someone who already has a primary partner, or who is otherwise committing most of their energies to a high intensity project.\n(\nThis somewhat-out-of-date document\ngives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)\nHigh-intensity Partnership (with a capital P)\nIn the long run, I would like to find a\nspiritual collaborator\n*, for the other half of an\naltruistic power couple\n.\nI want a Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom, and who will mutually support me in doing the same. A relationship in which we work together, train together, rest together, and help each other to live in integrity with our values. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time\nworking\n, and almost no time on conventional leisure activities (like watching movies together or going to parties).\nWhen I've dated people in the past, I've spent a lot of time and attention trying to\nhelp them get better\n. For example, having long conversations (or writing personalized essays) to convey the blindspots I observe in my partner's in-practice philosophy, or working with her to triangulate her skill gaps and to develop practice exercises that address them. Ideally, I'd like a partner who orients towards\nme\nand and\nmy\nweaknesses in a similar way—actively looking out for the things that I'm missing, then helping me to see them, understand them, and improve them—with skill and compassion.\nI have been seeking something like this since I was 15. It’s one one of the desires that I hold closest to my heart. But, at this point, I’m mostly not expecting to find/develop this kind of Partnership, at least before the singularity. Currently, I am constructing a life in which I can learn, and get better, and execute effectively, without the support of a life partnership. But at the same time, I'm\nalso\nkeeping out feelers in case an extremely compatible woman, who is also living this kind of life, crosses my path.\n(Some more operationalization of what this kind of relationship might look like\nhere\n.)\n* - To be clear, I am an atheist and an antitheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are\nbeyond the reach of God\n. But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.\nThe life I'm living\nI’m often happiest when I’m working, and when my life is going well, I work a lot. Most days, I’m working, or\nexplicitly resting\n, from 30 minutes after waking up to shortly before sleep (with a daily break for intense exercise). I structure my day to maximize my\nenergetic amplitude\n, so that to a first approximation, I’m either intensely alert and focused, or napping, but rarely in a middling state. I aggressively optimize for\nexcellent sleep\n.\nI very rarely socialize outside of work. When I see my friends, it's almost always for one of us to help the other think through a personal problem. I eat one meal a day (most frequently kale, sauteed in olive oil, with toasted tofu). I only very occasionally watch movies or TV, and generally set myself up to\navoid passively consuming content\n(eg I write at least one sentence about every piece I read).\nOutside of my core altruistic projects, I spend time\nexercising\n, reading (mostly AI stuff, history books, sometimes textbooks), writing\nblog posts\n, and sometimes hacking on\nsmall software projects\n. On the scale of months, I’m often doing some progression of\ndeliberate self-development\n: identifying a pressing skill gap, and then iteratively designing and doing exercises to develop the relevant subskills. I review anki most days.\nMost weeks, I take off\none day\n(and one evening) to rest, decompress, and do whatever feels most nourishing. Some rest day activities include: journaling, reading, writing, strength training, cleaning up my room, singing and memorizing folk songs (while walking around the neighborhood), going to the dog park to spend time with the dogs, meditating. When I’ve had a partner, I’ve enjoyed cuddling with her.\nWhen I have the capacity to take time off from work, I like doing doing various kinds of workshops and trainings, especially those that give me experience with interesting psychological states or faculties:\nmeditation\n,\nimprov\n,\ntherapy techniques\n, etc. (I don't do drugs, though.)\n(Additional detail on my weird, intense, lifestyle can be found\nhere\n.)\nConstraints and relationship-essentials\nWork\nOut of a combination of personal inclination and moral commitment, I work\na lot\n. I'm genreally at the office almost all my waking hours, 6 days a week (and usually for a few hours on my rest day, as well).\nAnyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with me working that, either because you have a similar orientation to the world themselves (maybe we can spend time coworking together?), or because you’re comfortable with a relationship that is emotionally intimate without being time-intensive.\nHonesty\nThe thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty.\nI've sometimes been in a context where there was a\nforbidden conversation\n, some true fact, or some belief I held, that I didn't feel free to acknowledge\n. In a situation like this, I feel pressure to pretend about, or distract from, or downplay the thing.\nI’ve come to think that I can’t build a robust relationship on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.\nCreating those kinds of contexts by merely\nintending to be honest\nisn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't do undue harm.\nI make explicit considered effort in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback) in a way that the other party can hear it without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty,\nNonviolent Communication\n,\nrationality\n, and\ncircling\nskill.\nBut even so, I am not a master at this. I still sometimes find myself in situations where there's something that feels too awkward to share even in otherwise candid relationships. I need help to maintain this kind of connection.\nIt is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward. This is crucial for me in an intimate relationship.\nMeta\nRelatedly, relationships with me typically involve a lot of “meta”: doing checkins, talking about the relationship and how it is or isn't working, flagging frictions and generating creative solutions together, investing effort trying to improve our communication processes, etc.\nSome past partners have found this onerous or annoying. “Can’t we skip all the process talk, and just do the cool things that the relationship is about?” I don’t see it that way. Much of what I care about in a relationship is the strength of the relationship itself, and this sort of meta and process-iteration is a means to that.\nCompletely unironically, leaving comments on my relationship-communication google docs is one of my love languages. (The google doc format is optional. That's just a communication method that has worked well for some past partners.)\nRelationship style\nI'm dispositionally monogamous, generally preferring to commit to only one person. However, I am happy to date people who have other partners themselves, especially if I can see that that makes them happy.\nI have only ever seriously dated one person at a time, and incidentally, I have only ever seriously dated people who were poly. (Effectively, I was monogamously partnered with someone who was dating other people.)\nI am more than willing to participate in a fully-monogamous partnership, if we're a good fit. I've dated poly people, not because I particularly prefer poly, but because the people I've been interested in have been poly.\nKids\nRaising kids appeals to me, but I’m not currently planning around having a family in the pre-singularity. However, I would do that if I found a\nhighly\ncompatible partner and having kids was important to her.\nThat is to say, I am\nopen\nto having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.\n(I might actively seek out a partner for raising a family after humanity is out of the\nacute risk period\nand life extension is solved.)\nSex\nSex is more important to me in the case of a once-or-twice-a-week companion than in the case of a committed Partnership. The point of having a capital-P partnership is mostly to help each other be better. For that, sex can be nice, but it isn't necessary. In the case of a more casual relationship, sexual and intimate emotional satisfaction is a larger fraction of what I care about.\nI’m interested in doing deliberate practice to get good at sex: focusing on my partner’s experience, with ample verbal and nonverbal feedback (plus after-action debriefs). It would obviously be better to do this with an emotionally-intimate partner, but I'm potentially open to trying with someone who I'm not otherwise dating, if we can establish really good communication and clarity about expectations first.\nVegetarianism\nI'm vegan (with\nsome caveats\n). So far, 100% of the people that I've dated seriously and 100% of the people that I've ever been in love with have been vegan. This is mostly correlation—the sort of people that I tend to be attracted to tend to be vegans. But it's\nalso\ncausal—I care about the ethics of the people I spend time with. For most people, eating factory farmed meat is the habit that causes the most direct harm to others. (Additionally, seeing someone eat meat tends to reduce my level of attraction for them.)\nI'm not confident, but I think I probably don't want to date people who aren't vegetarian, or who aren't otherwise careful about the externalities their life has on animals in factory farms.\nI'm not listing this as a firm deal-breaker, but it is important to me. If you eat factory farmed meat, and we get moderately far into dating, I'll want to have an honest and reasoned conversation with you about the ethics and tradeoffs involved.\n(I'm conscious that abstaining from animal products entirely is not a healthy choice for some people, and that there are additional tradeoffs.)\nSome friends' descriptions of me:\nFriend 1:\n\"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”\nFriend 2:\n\"Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at.\"\nFriend 3:\n“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”\nIf you want to say hello...\nIf any of the above sounds interesting to you, or even if you just want to say hi,\npress\nthis button\nto tell me your name and a few sentences about you (or just email me\nhere\n). Maybe we can meet up the next time\nwe're in the same metropolitan area.\nI'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. In\nan important way\n, your\ndoing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you.\nIf you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, you might explore the rest of this site, particularly the\npublic statements page\n, or flip through my\nblog\nand/or\narchived twitter threads\n.\nAid my quest!\nIf you’re not a good match with me (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed,\nyou can help by connecting me with thoughtful single (or non-polysaturated) women who want the sort of thing that I want.\nIf you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my\ngratitude\n."

You ask questions and share ideas but, beautifully, all of the movement and growth and opening is me, my own. Things are so shockingly possible and I’m so grateful to be realizing that with the help of your beautiful example and brilliant thinking-with. All my love. 🔆” \r\n-T, a dear friend & confidant \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBringing “now do a fun one” to weddings everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnline dating profiles can be limited and imprecise, so I jotted down a bunch of personal information that should make this process easier. I’ve also enabled commenting access on this doc in case you’d like to discuss any areas directly. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find this sort of writeup weird or off-putting, that’s okay – I wish you luck in your search! But if you appreciate that it saves us time and avoids potential future confusion/sadness, read on! \r\n\r\n\r\n(The topics written below are unlikely to change, but I am open to huge flexibility within their lines and to clarification when unclear or indeterminate. If any specific questions come to mind, please ask them :) \r\n\r\n\r\n“One summer, Julian skillfully navigated his way to a caribou roast at a cabin mere miles from the arctic circle. I was his plus one and will be telling this story until the end of time. Not for our journey in a rental car to this small Alaskan bush town with no cell service, not for the epic love story of the lovely couple who hosted us, but in awe of how my friend Julian’s generosity, authenticity, and curiosity in others lead to the moment where we stopped in the road, locked eyes with a caribou, and realized how magnificent the world is.” \r\n-Emily, a dear friend. [Editor’s note: I believe it was actually a moose.]  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhy do I call him “Tiny”? Because he’s my newt! \r\nAt a glance: \r\n* 31 years old\r\n* 6’0”\r\n* Born & raised near San Francisco, CA\r\n* Culturally Jewish but not religious\r\n* Reasonably fit & athletic\r\n* B.A. in Philosophy from Yale \r\n* Autistic & nonbinary (and does relationships sapphically) \r\n\r\n\r\nCore values:\r\n* Curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness (which include adventure, exploration, and experience)\r\n* Humor & fun\r\n* Honesty \r\n* Kindness and helpfulness (not to be confused with niceness)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Julian is a very cool and unique person and I can confirm they are not like Amber Heard or anything traumatic/yikesy/holy-shit-what-was-that-esque and are safe to date. No weird surprises or court cases with this one! 10/10, (would not date again though of course because we were wrong for each other, but figuring that out was easy breezy lemon treesy, plus I have since met the person I’m going to marry and do recommend that experience and think everyone should try it, 5 stars, and I enthusiastically hope Julian finds their life partner too, as they are a mega dope human and they deserve a happy ending, goddamnit!)”\r\n-Jane, a former partner who is lovely and kind and who clearly wrote this while following the Amber Heard / Johnny Depp trial \r\n\r\n\r\n“Julian is intensity. If you love flavor, color, texture, vibrancy, feeling, you’ll love Julian. If you’re not sure, his playful teaching style will get you to love it all and him. If you’re looking for bland or generic, he may not be for you. But if you try anyway, you’ll probably end up better than you started.”\r\n- Nikki, a former partner\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCurrent Funcle seeking promotion to Fun Parent. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For (in no particular order)\r\n1. A primary life partner. I would like to commit to putting a single relationship above all others. I would like my partner to be fundamentally interested in doing the same with me.\r\n2. Openness to exploration and creativity. This interest is both cultural (eg I spent the first 4 months of 2023 traveling through Australia and Asia, and 3 months recently in Europe) and social (I love meeting new people). I thrive more than most people when I feel free; I suffer more than most people when I feel trapped. To that end, I’m interested in forming a relationship that is fundamentally tailored to our individual needs (rather than one that fits some standard archetype). \r\n3. If I have kids, I would like to spend much of my time focused on them. I have thusfar built a life that would enable me to follow this passion, and I would like a partnership that enables me to do the same. \r\n   1. I. Love. Kids. I like acting like a kid, I like playing with kids, I like being around kids. I like the feeling of holding a child; it’s more absorbing than any other feeling in the world. (Note: While I’m not in a rush (as finding the right partner is more important than speed), I would enjoy having kids soon :) \r\n4. I enjoy caring and giving. I love the feeling of really, truly, deeply caring about someone – I’ve experienced it once romantically before and I would like to again, both with my partner and with my children. I would also like my partner to have a similar/parallel emotional experience about me. \r\n5. I want a partner who I experience as kind and generous and accepting. I have many uncommon traits that I would like to be appreciated/valued/loved. These traits include: \r\n   1. Autism – medically diagnosed; had a big impact on my childhood; these days many people I meet wouldn’t even guess but it’s still meaningful\r\n   2. Transness (which includes taking estrogen (more on this below). \r\n   3. Being a wandering soul – I’ve lived in a van for 5 years, changing city a few times per year. \r\n      1. Re this traveling topic, I would like to find a partner who either A) also enjoys living in new places, or B) joins on some adventures while otherwise living in a place that I find sufficiently satisfying that they can serve as a “home base” as I explore. (I love NYC. I lived in Manhattan for 6 months of 2022 and 6 months of 2023. I would enjoy being a “super snowbird”.) \r\n\r\n\r\n“I was still relatively new to stand up [comedy], and took encouragement to my heart. Julian offered to come and then take me out to steak dinner after a show, and Julian, a man of his words, followed through. After the show we walked around the corner to where his van was parked, where he then proceeded to cook me a steak himself on a campfire burner, handed me a plastic fork and paper plate, and said that he’d give me a knife but his dog Smidgen had licked all of them. It was one of the best steaks I’ve ever had.” \r\n* Matan, a kid from the youth group I used to mentor. [Editor’s note: I believe some of Matan’s details to be apocryphal but left the story unedited to let the love shine through.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTraits I have that I find attractive (attempting to be accurate and clear rather than show humility)\r\n* Intelligence and a unique perspective\r\n   * Most people who talk with me find me one of the most interesting conversationalists they know.\r\n   * I have been told that I am very much myself. If you like my perspective on the world, you're likely to love it because it's so amplified. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Humor\r\n   * I enjoy jokes, teasing, and funny art. My favorite painting is a portrait of a pig. I couldn’t stop laughing. The piece recently moved to Pennsylvania and I’d love to see it again.\r\n   * If I tease you or riff with you, it’s intended affectionately. People have different styles (and New Yorkers are often very literal). If you have a different style, no worries – I enjoy open communication here. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Intensity, competitiveness and drive\r\n   * I’m a competitive person. I’m generally very skilled at card games, board games, and sports. I’ve also applied this strategic skill to succeed in many areas of my professional and social life.\r\n   * I find properly-placed aggression and intensity to be incredibly sexy. I’ve received the feedback that I’m particularly skilled in bed; this is not mere happenstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Direct communication & a high degree of honesty\r\n   * I rarely lie – certainly much less than nearly everyone. I’m also much more precise with my words than nearly everyone.\r\n   * In a comfortable container, I can be both logically precise and profoundly emotionally vulnerable. If this tickles your fancy, we’re going to have a good time.\r\n\r\n\r\n* A high amount of self-knowledge and the ability to self-malleate when needed.\r\n   * I’ve intentionally changed some significant parts of myself. I can do this with a speed that often surprises others. I only do this when it aligns with my values (eg when I find a trait of mine is preventing me from achieving something that I care about more). I like that this ability allows me to grow quickly. \r\n\r\n\r\n“When I first met Julian, I had never heckled a single person in my life, especially not with a megaphone. There I was, a virgin burner swept away in the dust and heat, when he scooped me into his presence. Within minutes, with Julians help, I was screaming ‘hey you with the weird hat, come get some quesadillas!’” \r\n-Geoff, a friend who I met at Burning Man \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy friends sometimes draw me :) \r\nQuestions you may have\r\n1. Are you interested in marriage?\r\n   1. Short answer: yes. Longer answer: I am interested in a primary, committed, preferred-above-all-others life partnership for which the formal contract of marriage fits well. I’m in no rush, however, and am only interested in getting married once. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. How many kids? \r\n   1. I would enjoy having a large family (4+ kids). I am also open to having the standard american size (2-3). \r\n   2. I have previously frozen my sperm and would enjoy having biological children. I am not wedded to this preference but it is a relatively strong one. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. You’re taking estrogen? Why? Are you planning on “transitioning”?  \r\n   1. I began exploring my gender in September 2021 and it dramatically increased my life satisfaction so I started taking estrogen in May 2022. Since then, I have stopped and restarted estrogen on 3 occasions to see whether it is a preferable way of existing for me. It is. By a lot. \r\n   2. I don’t know where this exploration will end up. My current expectation is that it will take me to the femme side of nonbinary. There’s also a chance I will go all the way to transfemale. \r\n      1. I’m learning as I go, realizing an increasingly clear vision of my ideal self, and I’d like to have a partner who enjoys and values this sort of self-exploration. \r\n   3. I have previously dated people who preferred the masculine elements of me and disliked the feminine. This is not a recipe for a thriving relationship. As Daniel Sloss puts it, I’m looking for someone who loves all of me. (If you’re a straight woman looking for a man, look elsewhere!)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What gender(s) do you date?\r\n   1. In general, I find myself attracted to androgynous- or feminine-presenting people. The most accurate one-word description of my sexuality is “lesbian”. \r\n   2. Queer women are a great fit! 10/10, no notes :) \r\n   3. Nonbinary people are also great! (I have less experience dating nonbinary folks than queer women but it’s possible that’s more due to historical pool size around me than actual personal preference.)\r\n   4. Regarding other genders: \r\n      1. Despite gay men frequently finding me attractive (presumably because they see me as queer and a man), this has not historically been a good combination (presumably because they’re wrong about the latter). \r\n      2. I’ve never dated a straight man. I doubt it would work, but maybe? \r\n      3. Straight women have not historically fit well with me, presumably for gender-based reasons. Also, I have found they are more likely to exhibit these traits, both of which I dislike (although of course these are not exhibited by all straight women, which is why I’m not completely nixing the category): \r\n         1. A lack of creativity/queering/outside-the-box thinking. (As a friend put it, “strict heterosexuality is a failure in imagination”.)\r\n         2. Passivity rather than self-reflecting on their preferences and realizing those desires. (As one straight female friend recently realized at age 36: “I’ve spent my whole dating life standing on a street corner waiting for suitors to appear”.) \r\n   5. Many of my habits and preferences (eg around conflict resolution) simply align better with queer culture. This may simply be due to the fact that queer culture is more experimental and closer to the forefront of relationship dynamics, or it may indicate a fundamental queerness in myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Are you monogamous or non-monogamous? \r\n   1. I have dated in monogamous relationships and I have dated in open relationships. I have a slight preference toward open (partially because I don’t like the feeling of trapped-ness), but it is not core to my being. \r\n      1. The most successful relationships I have embodied previously are ones  similar to the structure practiced by most of my gay male friends: one stable primary partnership with large leeway (nearly complete permission?) for external relationships, with the common knowledge understanding that those external relationships will have no detrimental impact on the partnership. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. You live in a van?! Are you… well… poor?  \r\n   1. No. \r\n\r\n\r\n7. This doc is intense! Are you always this intense? \r\n   1. Many of my friends would describe me as lighthearted and fun. (One friend says I’m the funniest person he knows 😇.) That said, when the situation calls for it, I can be very, very intense. Since this doc is a braindump of important topics, it’s designed to be clear rather than beat around the bush, so I guess it’s intense 🤷‍♀️. \r\n   2. If you’re curious what I’m like in real life, let’s grab coffee or a videochat to see if we enjoy talking. In dating as in most areas, if we agree on the general vision of where we’re going (which is what this doc aims to do), I’m not super fussed about the details/timeline and am happy to move at whatever day-to-day pace feels comfortable. \r\n\r\n\r\n8. Why did you write this doc?\r\n   1. I want to ensure I know what I want.\r\n   2. I want to ensure you know what I want. \r\n   3. I want to save time and avoid unnecessary emotional turmoil for both me and others.\r\n   4. I bet it’s a damn good filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Anything else I should know? \r\n   1. That's probably enough for now. If you want to read all of the friend testimonials, you can find them here 😂\r\n\r\n\r\n“Julian invited me to my first burn event. One night, a casual game of foosball evolved into Julian schooling opponents in game while educating them in philosophy, like watching a TED talk if the speaker was presenting from a stolen Miata during a high-speed pursuit by both local and federal authorities. The moment drew a crowd instantly. Julian just shits art wherever he goes. I've never met someone more serious about fun.” \r\n-AJ, a dear friend \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMe & my seester, the day she graduated from business school 😻\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You should have a little reward at the end for anyone who finishes reading this. Like a ‘hey, congratulations, have a cookie’ but a metaphorical cookie.” \r\n-my friend Michał\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, congratulations, have a cookie: 🍪\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me: pitter.patter.precisely@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿KNOW SOMEONE WITH WHOM I’D BE A GREAT MATCH?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact details:\r\n* tyronebarugh+dating@gmail.com\r\n* Twitter DM to @barughtyrone\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for:\r\nI am looking for a relationship with a woman between 25ish and 35ish who:\r\n* is high-energy, agentic, altruistic, humorous, passionate, and smart;\r\n* wants two (or more) children, the first in the next 2-3 years;\r\nThis doesn’t mean I would expect my partner to be the primary caregiver. I’d happily take on - or share - that role, especially if my partner’s career was a big focus at that time.\r\n* has a secure or anxious attachment style;\r\nI think the attachment style concept is probably only directionally correct, and wouldn’t superficially rule someone out on the basis of some avoidant traits. Equally, I think that something approximating the “anxious-avoidant trap” is a pretty likely failure mode for my romantic relationships and I’m fairly keen to avoid that.\r\n   * wants a monogamous relationship; and\r\n   * ideally wants to live most of the time in New Zealand or Australia (although I am flexible on location, and regular visits to New Zealand could also work!)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a bit more about me:\r\n   * I’m a 29 year old cisgender man. For our present purposes, I’m basically straight (I think I’m mostly heteroromantic but bisexual).\r\n   * I’m from Wellington, New Zealand, and am about to return (mid January) after spending half of 2022 living nomadically.\r\n   * I am a lawyer, but might not practice law indefinitely. I’m motivated by the principles of ‘effective altruism’ (a social movement that encourages using reason, evidence, and an ‘expected value’ mindset to do the most social good we can).\r\n   * Until recently, this mainly caused me to secularly tithe 10% of my income to effective charities (I’ve taken the ‘Giving What We Can’ pledge), although more recently I’ve also joined the increasing number of effective altruists making changes to their career plans to increase their impact. Right now, I’m trying to ensure that effective altruism organisations spot and manage legal risks that could limit their impact.\r\n   * As a partner, I’m very dedicated and put lots of effort into the relationship. A flipside of this is that I can be quite emotionally needy - while I take responsibility for my emotional wellbeing, I expect to rely on my partner a lot for reassurance and to feel safe. I think I’d be a good fit for someone who wants a really close, serious partner - and a bad fit for someone who wants an element of casualness long-term.\r\n   * Running hurts my knees, but I love cycling. I’m really into skiing, and never grew out of going ten pin bowling. Day hikes are great, although I really like going on a multi-day hike with someone close and having a chance to have long form, meandering conversations over a few days. I’ve recently bought a VR headset, and playing fitness games like ‘Beat Saber’ increased how active I am on rainy days a lot.\r\n   * A major hobby of mine is ‘law as performance art:\r\n   *  I garnered the support of multiple legal academics in my bid to become the sole legal seller of cow’s milk in Wellington, New Zealand in reliance on a long forgotten law from 1919.\r\nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/thepanel/audio/2018836032/the-pre-panel-with-scott-campbell-and-sarah-sparks \r\n   * My “credentials and… enthusiasm to practise in the field of Pitcairn Law” were described as “impressive” by the Chief Justice of Pitcairn Island, who proceeded to decline my bid to be enrolled as a Pitcairn Island lawyer.\r\n   * I successfully fought to be naked in my passport photo.\r\n   * I like informative podcasts and videos. I like to know a little bit about everything, and would really value a partner who shares a curiosity about nearly everything. An exception to this is stuff that requires strong spatial awareness - e.g. learning how machinery works. I really struggle with this, and don’t find it very interesting.\r\n   * I am trying to think more quantitatively and more clearly - I am interested in the ‘rationality’ project popularised in places like Lesswrong, but think “aspiring rationalist” would be a fairer label than “rationalist”.. \r\n   * I’m perpetually confused by my personality, but the formulation a psychologist gave is that most things can be explained by the value I put on my close relationships - and also, I suspect, the universality with which I project that onto other people. I have a deep well of feelings in this regard. I bawled at age 11 watching the romantic comedy “50 First Dates”, and I’ve been unable to bring myself to watch the movie “Lion” (about an Indian boy adopted into an Australian family who goes to find his birth family and culture) because the trailer made me too sad. \r\n   * People usually think I’m jovial, or even flippant - I was described by another lawyer once as “vexatious”, but that was more a function of his need to touch grass than my personality. In contrast to that external presentation, I quickly dial that down when someone needs support, or when there is serious work to be done.\r\n   * Big 5 personality test results:\r\n   * 96 on extraversion\r\n   * 96 on openness to experience\r\n   * 87 on agreeableness\r\n   * 85 on neuroticism (trying strategies to reduce this)\r\n   * 64 on conscientiousness (ADHD diagnosis, although I think fairly well managed)\r\n   * I am concerned about animal welfare and factory farming. May go vegetarian or vegan in the future, but currently instead choose to offset my moral harms by donating to highly effective farmed animal welfare charities.\r\n   * I have well controlled eczema. The way I keep this controlled, however, is semi unpleasant. I cover my entire body in emulsifying ointment before bed, which means I can be a bit sticky right afterwards. I wear long pyjamas, but nice linen will still get ruined pretty quick. My partner will inevitably be exposed to second-hand moisturiser. I do expect this to improve in the future; my dermatologist says that biologic drugs are available now and improve things heaps, but I don’t meet the current funding criteria for them in New Zealand. Once this becomes widely available, I’ll be less sticky - and, crucially, I’ll be able to surf and swim as much as I like!\r\n   * I was previously obese (around 125-130kg), and am now overweight (98kg). My weight has been trending down fairly consistently, and I expect that it will plateau around 90kg.\r\n   * I’ve got pretty powerful legs, probably from carrying around a big load for a while. (I love hiking now, because it’s like I’ve lost more than an entire hiking pack’s worth of effort.) I have heterochromia in one eye, which I reckon looks pretty cool. And an extra vertebra!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\tI use this photo for Linkedin, for work Slack channels, and as social proof that I can be serious in professional contexts if I really have to.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tThis is one version of the good life - blue skies, a freshly stained deck, and a flourishing veggie garden in my suburban NZ backyard. I’m not necessarily wedded to this version of the good life, and would love to know how my weekends might be different with you.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tI don’t take many photos, so haven’t got a snap of my favourite suit. But a colleague did, and included it in my farewell card from my old job.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tI like diving, skiing, cycling, and hiking.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tFair warning - my hair might end up like this again some day!\r\n\t  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\tI love any opportunity to poke fun at the silly implications of things I sincerely believe. This year’s halloween costume was ‘rats on heroin’, one implication of my belief that we should reduce suffering."

I like people, parties and conversation\r\n* I am earnest, trying to make the world better\r\n* I am well-described by ADHD, I am distracted, but I’m trying to improve\r\nStats\r\nAge: 31. Yeah my hair greyed early.\r\nHeight: 6’4” (1.94m).\r\nLocation: London, currently attempting to get a US visa.\r\nJob: I run a web development team of 3.\r\nPoly?: Yes, but my main focus is having a primary partner and I’d try being monogamous for the right person[1]\r\nSexuality: Straightish\r\nWants kids?: Yes\r\nWants to be stay-at-home-parent?: A genuine possibility \r\nWhat I’m looking for: Primarily a long term partner to have kids with (although open to short term things)\r\nWhere to find me online: Twitter - for my sins\r\nPhotos\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\nDistinctive things\r\nGrey hair\r\nYes. It’s grey. It has been since I was 13. I like to see this as a feature - you can experience the social opprobrium of dating an older man, without me being tied down by things like a house or a sports car.\r\nCharisma\r\nI don’t know how one writes about this in a way that doesn’t come across as obnoxious. People say I’m charismatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve hosted like 50 dinners.\r\nI did a rap on a train once.\r\nI started a project that got on wikipedia\r\nBlunt\r\nI’m working on this, but I am blunt and spiky at times. Accuracy is very important to me and I’m frank about money, sex, ambition, feelings. . At times I let this get in the way of being kinder and that's something I'm working on. But if you're somebody who is deeply sensitive, then that might be a large cost to you.\r\nLoquacious\r\nI love to have conversations. I text. A lot. I will definitely call you back first. I may be cycling at the time[2].  Hopefully you’ll find this touching rather than annoying. But if you don’t like being bothered.. \r\n\r\n\r\nI dated someone once who could spend the whole evening in silence. Reader, I did not marry her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I like to talk about:\r\n* Nothing. I like chatting shit. I like blanket statements, pillow talk and complicated wordplay. I like to take dad jokes and push them father. My aim is not to be very funny on average, but to be very funny on aggregate.    \r\n* Feelings. I like to process how I have felt. About conversations and plans. I want to hear how you feel and what you want. I want to know you and be known by you. My sense is that fact is more interesting than fiction and that humans are more interesting when they are less mysterious. I know few people I don’t like and with almost everyone I can find something fascinating.\r\n* Everything. I like talking about policy, effective altruism, forecasting. How to run the country, how to run the dishwasher, how to run away from this strange man who won’t stop talking. It’s all good stuff\r\n* You. If we were to date I would want to make you more like you want to be. I’m pretty intense but if you want to grow, I want to help. I want to help you in your job, your art, your mental health, your relationships with friends and if you want, lovers. \r\n\r\n\r\nI struggle to stay focused on one thing. If you want that. I’m not for you.\r\nFriends and relationships \r\nI used to be an evangelical Christian and in the last few years have got really into effective altruism and forecasting. It’s quite a switcheroo and I have a wide range of friends with a variety of worldviews as a result. I love community - I think and talk about rationalism, EA, neoliberalism, whatever tv show I’m watching.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, I have lots of friends and move in a wide circle of people - I’m often going to parties or visiting Durham for a week etc. etc. I’d love for you to come with me but if that’s not what you want then if it’s a good match in other ways, I imagine we can figure something out\r\n\r\n\r\nMy default would be monogamish/an open relationship but I’m open to discussing. I want to have a life partner but be able to connect with others occasionally. Integrity is really important to me, I'm a flirtatious person by nature, but won't cross any boundaries we set. I don’t want that. I’ll be honest and I’m willing to be flexible, but I also want to be kind to myself. \r\nOther skills\r\n* Good at holding things\r\n* Able to walk across a messy floor without breaking things\r\n* Blood clots fast\r\nWho might be a good fit\r\nSome words that jump to mind\r\n* Curious\r\n* Playful\r\n* Honest\r\n* Intelligent\r\n* Kind\r\n* Patient\r\n* If you like social events.\r\n* If you like dancing\r\nFor balance\r\nI am very biased. Some of my exes had a great time dating me, a couple did not. If you know any of my female friends, feel free to ask them for the details. I don’t want to paint an overly rosy account.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf any of this sounds good, reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr share with a friend. I think I make clear the kind of person who would be a good fit and those who wouldn’t.\r\n\r\n\r\nDM me on twitter or email me at nathanpmyoung@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\nIf something I could change turned you off, I’d appreciate anonymous feedback at https://www.admonymous.co/nathanpmyoung \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a song that feels like dating me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc3Jo65Lct4 \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1]Everyone thinks they are unique and I am no exception. I would like kids and to some extent my poly/monog status is subordinate to that. But I am odd. I don’t think I am well described as a typical monogamous person, because I am spiky with all sorts of preferences. I am willing to negotiate. For more info there is.. another.. blog, which you can ask for by messaging me including the word gubernatorial or like, figuring out how to find it \r\n[2]I have stopped doing this, it was dumb."

Will do at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find grace and being kind to those who are hard to be kind to beautiful, although sometimes I do get down and honestly just dislike people and think some people will never change, and all that stuff and blah blah blah. Nuance/disclaimers aside, I'm looking for someone who is primarily just a person of love in this crazy world. I am not a fan of a tendency towards outrage, mockery, and being offended all the time. I’m generally more interested in exploring the gray areas + pros and cons of all sides than I am in aggressively choosing a side. I am not very prone to anger and can talk about almost anything without taking it personally. I think I’m fairly good at taking criticism, especially if it’s done with care/love, but have room to improve too. Hopefully if I can find someone like me, communication will be lightweight and relatively easy and free, and we will be able to talk about just about anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in all sorts of things, including the big existential question \"what _are_ we?\", the brain, consciousness, etc. I am agnostic and fascinated by it all. The absurdity of this existence gets me. The fact that we just find ourselves alive one day in this insane world / story we are living in with no memory of how we got here or what's going on in a giant universe with no sure signs of anyone else being around is a freaking trip. I can see things from a scientific and rational perspective, and I am also a very loving person with a sense of wonder about the nature of reality, etc. The exponential growth of technology and this perhaps incredibly pivotal sliver of time we are born in is also crazy and fascinating.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in spirituality / if there is any sort of bigger, cosmic force out there / some sort of bigger reason why things will turn out okay, but I don’t spend much time on it. It’s hard to know exactly how that would fit together with all sorts of animals living short lives of seemingly excruciating suffering, and just all of the pain in the world in general, etc, but I enjoy having the hope and wonder anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite this semi intense bio, I am a bit of a goof and am very easygoing. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am always willing to change my point of view and admit when I realize I am wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy all sorts of things. Apart from just connecting with others whether it be from deep conversations or watching something heartfelt together, I think a couple of things I should mention specifically are physical activity and physical touch + sexuality. Someday, I would like to learn how to hang glide if I live somewhere where this is possible. Snowboarding, longboarding downhill, and all sorts of of other fast paced athletic things sounds awesome as well 🙂 Maybe I can do that thing where you snowboard with a deployed parachute someday 😁\r\n\r\nI would like a partner where we can strive to be our best selves together, help the most people / do the most good, capture the most life and experiences, and hopefully and motivate each other on a sacred journey to be as impactful as we can be. I generally like to spend most of my time being productive, and love having a mission. I hope we are on the same page here and it won't bother you too much if I’m on my laptop a lot multitasking on a project or something while we watch TV, or you are reading, or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find the end of this video starting at 43:30 to be very powerful, and I hope it resonates with you in some way or another: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&t=43m30s\r\n\r\n\r\nI like humor about things being awful or something I can't quite pinpoint, lol. I'm certainly okay with dark humor as long as it's not malicious. Here's one: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/s/9BvFjVRTqQ\r\n\r\n\r\nStoof:\r\n- Born May 15th, 1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n- 5”8, 165 Lbs, but this is subject to change:\r\n- I have run or biked basically every day for the last 7 years. Have been weightlifting for 6 months as of April 2024 and am in it for the long haul.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I plan on moving away from the city I’m living in someday, which is Lubbock, Texas. I’m open to meeting people who live far away from me right now and someday moving to be closer to each other. My son’s mom will have to be a part of any decision as to where me and my son will move, however, but she is on board with getting out of our current city. Asheville, North Carolina is a town we both think could be cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I ideally would not like to have more kids, but could perhaps someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I have a preference for a monogamish relationship / open relationship that tends to be mostly monogamous in practice where we are still \"each other's person\" (not ownership. Deep love)\r\n\r\n\r\n- I would still be very happy with monogamy if we had a very strong focus on purpose in life and helping others.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I’m not sure I would want full on poly / a group relationship. Dating separately could probably be okay, but it might be nice to live in some sort of non poly community if so, so that I didn’t have to just be alone at the house when my partner(s?) wasn’t around. I’m not sure how much this is actually appealing to me though. Then again, I don’t want to place hard rules on each other and want to allow each other to be free as much as possible, so I would be okay with not having things be like mandated by rule that other relationships need to be limited to some small scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been doing property management. Was going to try getting into software development and using my CS degree, but found it hard to find a job in this market, and honestly, I have some mild ADHD and would struggle with a job like that unless I was able to take a nap during mid day and have a couple of hours where my brain feels exhausted and I don't get much cognitive work done. If I’m able to nap though, I’m normally great for the rest of the day. I used to be Christian and have a lot different views. I actually thought not worrying about money was a virtue, lol. I wish I worried about it more. Nevertheless, I’m well on my way towards financial freedom with my investments. This is lame, but some day I have an inheritance coming. Probably another reason I was never worried about money apart from just wanting to strive to help others and do something with myself. Right now though, I’m just getting my commercial driver's license and am going to be doing local delivery truck driving. Not very glamorous, but I love driving and this will give me energy for the rest of life. If software developers are in demand when my son is slightly older and takes less time, I’ll get a remote software developer job where I can take a nap and work a schedule that works for me. I am working on a stock trading thing as a software side project.\r\n\r\nIf you are a very type A person, we probably wouldn't be a great fit. I'm pretty laid back.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy son's mom doesn't want to be together because I’m not Christian. She wants me to “find Jesus so we can get married”. She thinks highly of me and we coparent and work together great for our son. I have hesitations about being together with her that I won't get into here. This always sucks and obviously isn't great vibes to talk about. I’d be happy to talk about it not over text though.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly I’ve had some moments in life that have really brought my shortcomings to the surface. Situations I wish I would have handled better. I’m certainly a normal person with my own struggles, downsides, etc. When circumstances are bleak, I am subject to depression. Having had an honestly difficult young child had been a huge test of patience at times, and there have been extremely challenging moments, and then there are absolutely beautiful moments at other times. At least it has helped me to further develop my patience. My son is getting older now, and really sweet moments are on the rise, and challenging moments are on the decline.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have only one child – A  son who turned 4 years old on September 17th, 2023. I assume this will be seen as a downside by most potential partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am extremely understanding of shortcoming due to weakness, sadness, etc. Less so of aggression, or just poor overall character. I like to differentiate between being a good/bad person and being a functional/high performing person. \r\n\r\n\r\nFairly low on neuroticism - probably the most scientifically established, objective thing that leads towards good relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nFairly high on agreeableness, which has some downsides and I have to make sure I don’t let people take advantage of me, because it’s really hard for me to just say “not my problem” when people are in a bad situation, but this trait is supposed to make for good relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact & misc:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can message me on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/kevin.wheeler or email me at kevinwheeler90@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find my OkCupid profile here: https://www.okcupid.com/profile/16703780554927230141\r\nIf you have any feedback for me, perhaps about how this document could be better, please feel free to send it."

He genuinely wants to be there for other people. I’ve seen him show so much openness to emotional connection in times when even other resilient and emotionally mature people would have been inclined to take a step back from their existing relationships. I’ve never seen stonewalling or apathy from him. Quinn always cares, and is excited to show that he cares. If you have the same love languages as Quinn, he’ll be able to make you feel super special. Being there for other people and caring doesn’t just mean caring about his friends or partners—he also shows up for communities. At a party, he’s either the host or the guy you assume is the host because he introduces a new burst of energy to each room he’s in.\nQuinn also has a super strong sense of self; he won’t passively fall into trends. I’ve never heard him be insincere or mocking. When so much media and so many conversations contain at least a little bit, and sometimes a lot, of mockery, Quinn has a refreshingly firm focus on topics where he can be completely sincere. Basically, it feels like the idiom “big-hearted” was invented to describe Quinn.\nTraits to make me swoon\n​\nSincerity\n: Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness.\nAnalyticalness\n: My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that.\nConviction\n: Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean\nloyalty\nto convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments.\nCompassion\n: I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others.\nAmbition\n: I want to be with goal-directed people.\nIntrospectiveness\n: There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up.\nType of guy (containing exactly one lie)\n​\nAn ex once reported that I'm \"really gung ho about the mortifying ordeal of being known\".\nI've been known to run taco nights at my house.\nSwam from alcatraz to SF.\nReally psyched about work, generally enjoy being someone who works a lot.\nAsk me about my subsubfield of preventing AI from causing my death.\nAlmost entirely vegetarian.\nBaby fever, but don't do a lot of thinking about my parenting values because I'd rather do that thinking as a group project with a special someone.\nOften singing and humming, hopefully a turning a loved one's name into song.\nI have at least two mysterious backstories.\nYes the kidney tshirt is real.\nOne secret zest for life / high hedonic setpoint trait/behavior that it'd be more fun to surprise you with.\nFic/media: mostly scifi and fantasy. Music: metal, prog, jazz.\nI'm getting turbo back into Wagner, currently mapping out the Arthurian sources (starting with Troyes) so I can better understand Parsifal/Lohengrin and to a lesser extent Tristan/Isolde.\nSome freaky kinks but not an outrageously high libido.\nIncome and net worth each low six figures, no debt. I\nroughly\nthink embryo selection is more important than buying a house, but open to discussion.\nI'd like to take the Giving What We Can 10% pledge at some point over the next few years.\nAtheist\nReach out\n​\nEmail:\nquinn.dougherty.forall@gmail.com\nWould love to pivot to signal > sms > element/matrix > telegram > some mutual slack we happen to both be in after a brief exchange.\nOpeners / conversation menu\n​\nHow's your master plan going?\nAffection styles / love languages\nYour (least?) favorite failure mode of \"Radical Honesty\" -adjacent practices\nHow erotic is assembling furniture together, scale of 1-10\nHow you think about the poly vs monog question\nOne of your \"strong view weakly held\" current childrearing beliefs/strats that you want my help to double check as a research project.\nTestimonial by my dear friend Gavriel\nTraits to make me swoon\nType of guy (containing exactly one lie)\nReach out\nOpeners / conversation menu\nSocials\nCan we secure AI via formal methods?\nLessWrong\nEffective Altruism Forum\nGitHub\nX\nManifold\nSite built at Fri Oct 31 2025 14:05:41 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)."

Older and somewhat jaded, in my case. And if not exactly less attractive, then at least more of an acquired taste.\nAlso there was the rise of the Tinder Clones (of which OKC is now one of the worst). Also Instagram filters and Snapchat lenses. Also, you know, a pandemic.\nAnd so here we are a decade later writing bespoke “Date Me” docs, God help us.

I’m seeking someone who values meaningful connections and shares my values of ethical living and personal growth.\r\n* A mix of introverted and extraverted tendencies, I enjoy a balance of socialising and quiet time. I prefer small gatherings or one-on-one conversations over large group discussions\r\n* Vegetarian, I eat 95% vegan, with the occasional vegetarian meal/snack when abroad/visiting\r\n* Somewhat frugal, partly wanting to save money (and perhaps retire early), partly because I value simplicity\r\n* I care about my impact on the world and moral implications of my actions\r\n* My main love language is physical touch and I’m curious about exploring Tantra more\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I do/like\r\n* Go to self-developmental/spiritual workshops/events and embodiment practices like Moving Connections/Contact Improvisation or occasionally ecstatic dance. \r\n* Organise and facilitate meditation groups and retreats\r\n* Learn about psychology and understanding human nature\r\n* Hike in nature; also, everything within an hour I’d call easily walkable 🙂\r\n* I like animals and enjoy pet sitting which I used to do as a side hustle (my main job is analyst)\r\n* I used to travel quite a bit pre-pandemic, however these days I value more building community where I live\r\n* Draw, craft and/or paint portraits of my friend’s pets 🙂\r\n* Read books, both fiction and non-fiction\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I don’t often do\r\n* I’m not much of a foodie - I batch cook and don’t mind eating the same thing for number of days; it is not to say that I don’t enjoy a nice meal, just I usually prefer to spend my time, money and energy on other things\r\n* Sporty things - I enjoy gentle activities like hiking, cycling, and swimming, but I’m more focused on the experience rather than athletic achievement\r\n* I rarely drink alcohol and don’t watch streaming services much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\n* Someone emotionally available and responsible, who values transparency, open communication, and believes that love is both a feeling and a choice\r\n* Spiritual yet grounded\r\n* Playful/compatible sense of humour\r\n* I appreciate partner who is mindful of my ethical choices and would be open not to eat meat and fishes in front of me; I feel the need to disengage emotionally in these situations and I wouldn't want to be disengaged emotionally around my partner\r\nA few caveats\r\n* I’m primarily seeking a long-term connection, but if we get along really well I might be open to short-term too\r\n* Similarly, while I’m primarily looking for monogamy, I’m open to exploring ethical non-monogamy with the right person - someone experienced and responsible in navigating such dynamics\r\n* I’d rather meet in person/have video call to see how we get on than keep texting - but please do share why you think we might be compatible\r\n* I would like to have child(ren), also exploring solo-parenthood path if this is not part of your aspiration\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf this resonates, I’d love to hear from you (perhaps by email at jekot.agnieszka@gmail.com)"

      "fullText": "﻿________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! I’m Meredith. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n* A deeply committed Christian only looking to date other Christians. \r\n* I’m a 36, straight, monogamous woman living in Oakland\r\n* I drink socially; I don’t smoke; I don’t do drugs.\r\n* I’m somewhere between 5ft 6in and 5ft 7in tall.\r\n* I want biological kids, and I am anxious about my timeline. I’m only looking to meet people who want marriage and family too. If for whatever reason I can’t have biological kids, I want to become a foster mom. (I am a carrier for a recessive genetic condition, but I'm open and happy to discuss it—let's chat!)\r\n* Descriptive words: bubbly, passionate, smart, kind, fun, confident, friendly\r\n* Personality: I’ve done a lot of work on self-understanding and personal growth. I’m dependable, collaborative, and extraverted; I’m a people-person who loves helping others. \r\n* Values: Integrity, growth, generosity, lovingkindness, self-ownership. \r\n* Politics: I’m moderate-to-liberal, and I believe curiosity is key to heal the rifts in our society. I’m frustrated by modern politics; I think that Trump is serving only his ego and self-interest, while Democrats currently lack a compelling vision. I enjoy nuanced political discussion, and get my news from diverse print media sources. I'm looking for a partner who prioritizes kindness and respect above complete political agreement.\r\n* Theology: I am a follower of Jesus. My faith is active and central to my life—I prioritize daily prayer, time in Scripture, and putting faith into action through service and generous giving. I value deep theological discussion, but I care much more about having respectful dialog and shared spiritual growth with my partner than complete agreement.* \r\n\r\n\r\nStrengths: I’m the friend in my social circles who makes sure we stay connected by reaching out to get our next event on the calendar. Friends and coworkers often seek me out when they’re facing a problem to get an empathetic ear and a new perspective, to bring clarity out of confusion. I have lots of interesting ideas and I articulate my thoughts well. I get compliments on my go-to potluck food: deviled eggs. At my best, I light up the room with infectious enthusiasm and joy. (Someone actually wrote that about me in a 360 feedback a few years ago, and it still gives me warm fuzzies!) \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lifestyle: \r\n* I prioritize getting sleep, staying active, and eating healthy food. My bedtime is 9:30-10pm so I can wake up in time for quiet time and exercise before my commute. I like to get fresh produce at the local farmer’s market that I cook up to have leftovers all week. My current goal is to run 3 times a week; I’d like to improve my running speed. I’ve run 2 10k races, and now I’d like to focus on my time before adding more distance. (I’d like to get to a 10min/mile pace.) I also really enjoy dance workout classes. \r\n* I love spending time with kids. I adore my niece and nephew (10 and 8); my niece flew out all by herself over the summer for a few days, and it was such a delight to have her visit. I try to see them in person 2-3 times a year. I volunteer with a girl in foster care (7) through the CASA program, and she brings so much joy to my life. On our outings, we go to playgrounds; get icecream; paint our nails; go swimming; read books; and more. I’m close friends with a local family with two girls (10 and 6) who are like additional nieces to me. Additionally, I’ve taught Sunday school for multiple years, and I’ve also done science mentoring and outreach with kids.  \r\n* I’m a big reader; it’s my go-to evening activity. I read a smattering of sci-fi/fantasy, “book of the year” type works, mysteries, women’s lit, and self-help. I recently read “Connecting with Self and Others” and can’t stop talking about it. I’m working through the Bosch murder mystery series currently. I’m a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson as well. \r\n* I host a quarterly game-playing event for the ladies at my church. It’s been a super fun time! My condo has a great shared use community space, which makes it really easy. \r\n* I enjoy going on adventures and trying new things. Examples: hiking / backpacking; seeing theater / musicals; scuba diving; art / craft fairs; kayaking; glass flameworking and other arts classes (love The Crucible!); cooking classes; and travel.  \r\n* I’ve loved classical guitar since I first heard it played as a kid, and during COVID, I finally bought a nylon-string guitar. I’ve been teaching myself to play on-and-off since then, and recently have gotten back to playing about 10-15 min each evening. Current level: I can play Christmas carols for my own enjoyment (and you might have to twist my arm to get me to play for you!) \r\n* I have over a 1500 day streak on Duolingo; I’m learning Spanish! I have a group of Spanish speaking colleagues and other learners who also meet monthly and chat in Spanish together; and there are also Spanish speakers at my church. I get a 6-week sabbatical in 2026, and I’d like to go to Mexico (or other Spanish-speaking country) and do an immersive experience to get myself to the next level. \r\n\r\n\r\nProfessionally: Currently, I work as a project manager in Pathology at Genentech. I’ve been in this job for a bit over 5 years, and really enjoy it. Overall, I find a lot of value in enabling high-performing teams to overcome barriers to bring about new treatments for patients. I went to college at Wheaton, IL and I got my PhD in Chemistry at UC Berkeley. \r\n\r\n\r\nDating me would be like: Dancing in the kitchen with an open bottle of wine while our dinner is in the oven. Daily check-ins about your day, how you slept, what’s on your mind. Snuggling on the couch as we watch a movie, read books, or just chat. Going on adventures to explore the city or the surrounding natural beauty. Discussing our thoughts, feelings, reactions, and ideas about current events, politics, church life, and more. Praying together and reading the Bible together. Having a partner in service, generosity, and making the world a better place. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou: I’m looking to build a life with someone who loves Jesus and loves me. I want you to be striving to be your best self; humble in learning from others; earnestly discerning and submitting to God’s will for your life; and confident in who you are and what you want. I want to feel close, connected, and safe with you. Mutual attraction and physical affection are important to me. \r\n\r\n\r\nSend me a note if you’d like to connect! For those who reach out, I’d like to ask that we schedule a brief phone or video call before first. It helps me feel comfortable meeting up!\r\n\r\n\r\n*I really do care about respectful discussion more than agreement; but as I know the following can be deal-breakers, I’d like to be up-front of some of my beliefs on hot-button topics: \r\n* I believe that the Bible in its original language, in the context of the original audience, is fully authoritative. \r\n* I’m egalitarian (I support women in church leadership).\r\n* I think God’s best plan is for chastity outside of heterosexual marriage.\r\n* I believe God used evolution to create the world.\r\n* I believe that the Holy Spirit can continue to work in miraculous ways. \r\nI’m happy to talk about any of these things more, if you’re curious!"

      "fullText": "﻿See my updated date-me doc!\r\nOriginal preserved below, for posterity.\r\n@rmushkatblat / Robert Mushkatblat\r\nEmail: bobert.mushky@gmail.com\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery Short Summary\r\nChild of Soviet Jewish immigrants, software guy, calm.  70% predictable from archetypes.\r\nA Little Less Short\r\nOccupation: lesswrong.com\r\nOrientation: Straight / Monogamous\r\nTraits poorly predicted by archetypes:\r\n* I show up to things on time, don’t miss appointments, and file personal taxes well before the deadline.\r\n* I appreciate fine dining and tea (as artforms, not merely as hedonism, though that’s good too).\r\n* I drink infrequently (maybe 5 times in the last year?).\r\n* I dance (international latin ballroom).\r\nPersonality: Most comfortable in groups of 2 - 6, care a lot about those things that I focus on (ethics and aesthetics both); have sometimes been called a snob (affectionately).  Not a huge fan of super loud events, though I like the occasional prog metal concert.  I like to share my joy in food with friends & partners, and figure out what they like well enough to remove the need for them to exert any sort of mental effort on making decisions in that domain if they want.  (Food is not the only thing, just a good example of how I relate to people.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For\r\nPersonality:\r\nDespite my archetype (high-decoupling nerd male software engineer), most of my closest friendships rest more on personality fit and mutual openness + support, rather than shared careers, interests, or hobbies (excepting rationalism).  Which is to say I spend some time talking about software or x-risk with friends when off the clock, but not most of it.  I probably would not have predicted those particular friendships ahead of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, important components have been:\r\n* Ability and willingness to discriminate between factual disagreements and values differences.  See: high-decoupling.\r\n* At the same time, not being strongly focused on contentious but intractable domains, like mainstream politics\r\n* Having an even temper.  Many other personality traits have been highly variable; e.g. I have quite a bit of practice supporting people through bouts of imposter syndrome.\r\n* Actually deeply giving a shit about something.  I’m not sure if this is causal but it sure has been a common thread.  That something is not always something I personally care about a ton, but it’s generally intelligible to me.  Examples: the flourishing of the local community one grew up in, exploring the limits of communication styles & bandwidth for another…\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialization:\r\nI like small things more than big things.  My tolerance for size increases when I know more of the people.  Quieter is better than louder.  Unstructured is better than structured - I’m not big on board games or movie nights (😬) but do like spontaneously-occurring pockets of discussion.  These are derived from how I’ve felt across many different events, activities, and relationships, and exceptions certainly exist.  Of course, the kind of relationship I expect to be healthy anticipates occasions where we meet halfway and and those were we fly solo, depending on context.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am basically happy to pack my calendar full of socialization, obligations permitting - I’ve yet to run into situations where I was turning down opportunities to socialize because I’d had enough rather than because I didn’t have the time, or because I didn’t expect to enjoy myself doing that particular thing.  However, I wouldn’t feel particularly bereft if I spent a week at home, if I was doing something useful with that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren:\r\nAt least one, and would want to see how the first one goes before deciding on more.  Pessimistic about traditional education, mostly due to personal experience, and would pretty strongly prefer defaulting to homeschooling or thoughtful co-op arrangements.  Ultimately, though, would want to defer to whatever actually worked best for the kid, as the person with the most introspective access relevant to the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance:\r\nI take care of myself reasonably well and happily outsource other things (e.g. house cleaning).  I do have aesthetic preferences about my living spaces but put a pretty heavy penalty on things that add significant overhead in terms of time and attention.  I find doing tasks in this category much easier with another person than doing them alone, but don’t want to over-promise.\r\nInteresting things I’ve done (or have happened to me):\r\n* I wrote the first long-form HP/f!TMR[a][b] fanfic (it’s not actually great, but it is completed)\r\n* Got as far as “finished MVP and launched” with a startup while working full-time\r\n* Have been stung by jellyfish three (3) times and lived to tell the tale\r\n* No longer keep track of how many times someone has said \"this is the best thing I've ever tasted\" or similar after taking them somewhere new\r\n* Speak mother tongue near fluently (русский)\r\n* Flexible[c][d] enough to do things too disturbing impressive to be written down\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies (and how to get to know me):\r\n* Ballroom dance (international latin ballroom, could use a partner)\r\n* Choir\r\n* Tea (currently exploring aged whites)\r\n* Run LA rat meetup (I continue to be semi-active in the Discord server)\r\n* Food (my FTC profile, for my writing in a totally different social context)\r\n* Glowfic\r\n* Used to spend time helping people get better jobs (mostly software)[e]\r\n[a]love you for saying this / admitting that you write fanfic <3\r\n[b]<3  it was a big part of my life!\r\n[c]Do you mean in a literal sense? Either way I'm not sure what you mean\r\n[d]yes :)\r\n[e]how's this working out now?"

I'm leaving this page up for posterity and those curious about things like this, but am removing it from my site's header as I am now in a relationship with someone.\n(And yes, they're someone who filled the form out :) )\nGood luck to everyone else out there looking for love!]\n(I have\ntestimonials\nnow!)\nJanuary 1st marked the start of my\nnewest season\n, Romance. Overall my life is pretty fantastic, but I'm still looking for a long-term relationship, preferably on my way to marriage and at least one bio-kid within the next couple years. So I picked this season to really commit to that goal in every way I could think of, which includes things like just, you know, openly saying  to everyone who might find me interesting \"Hey, I'm single and looking to date\" and seeing what happens.\nSo if you're here, maybe you're interested in me based on my writing, or passions for rationality and psychology and fiction. If so, great! Those are things I enjoy talking about, so we'd probably get along well.\nThe quickest way to my heart, however, would be if you're into some combination of rationality, video games, or writing. I say that because I've always been a very \"activities oriented\" boyfriend.  I enjoy cuddling together with a pair of books or watching a show, but everyone I've fallen in love with was through either playing games together, or co-writing/RP, or debating intellectual or philosophical topics.  If the idea of spending hours doing those things makes you happy, then there's a good chance we'll be able to make each other happier together than we would be apart.\nThe other thing that matters a lot to me is personal development. I feel deeply driven to constantly learn, grow, and improve myself in every way I can.  That's not to say I'm \"Type A,\" since there are plenty of days where I just chill and have fun, and girlfriends have said they find me relaxing to be around. But if I notice something isn't working for me or those I care about, I want to improve it, and I'm pretty agentic in doing so.\nAll of which is to say, I want someone who wants to be that way too, and puts the effort in to learn how, both by improving epistemics and on the instrumental level of active problem solving. Someone who will be happy to help me improve more than I could on my own, and is looking for someone to do the same for them.\nIf you think that describes you, feel free to\nfill out this form\nand we'll see what happens!\nIf you already know me and are worried about \"ruining the friendship,\" I can promise with very high confidence that won't happen. If you're worried about looking foolish if you try and fail, I can also promise that I'll always have nothing but respect for people who show vulnerability to reveal who they really are.\nI am doing this, after all ^_o\n(Also, I'm willing to relocate for romance if things work out well. Meanwhile we can get to know each other online, and since I work remotely, I'm happy to do short or long visits to spend time together if we hit it off!)"

Check out my\nAMA\non the topic.\nCarrie\nwon the $1,500 dating bounty for causing me to meet\nCarissa\nby sharing my dating profile on zir Facebook wall. Ze donated the bounty to the\nForesight Institute\n. We've been together since April 5th, 2022.\nCheck out\nour story on YouTube\n. And follow Carissa on\nFacebook\nor\nInstagram\nfor frequent updates on us ☺️.\nI'm very grateful for my friends\nAlton\nand Toli for adding this dating bounty to my initial parenting bounty! Check out\nToli's own dating profile/bounty\n! (And let us know if that causes you to date 😄)\nAnd let me know if you have a bounty of your own so I can help you, and add it here if you want 🙂\nOther relevant writings\n:\nMy current lifeplan\nSperm donor profile\nBounty\nBounty: 3,500 USD\nI'm offering 2,000 USD\nfor someone I end up consensually being a legal parent with who you’ve\nintroduced me to and who wasn’t already a prospect. If someone reached out to me as a result of you sharing my\nprofile on social media, that counts too. Paid only for my first child.\nMy good friend\nAlton\noffered an additional\n1,000\nUSD\nto support me ❤️ – ze said:\nI'll add $1000 to the bounty for the referral of someone who is with you and brings you a lot of joy for 18+\nmonths\nbecause I love celebrating love. I'd want to have the option to have a 2 hour call with you both at that time\nwindow\nas a strong preference but not necessary.\nMy friend\nToli\nalso offered an additional 500 USD\nto support me ❤️ – ze said:\nI will 50% match that bounty ($500) with the same conditions 🙂 I don't know Mati *that well* (yet). But very much\ninterested in seeing him find a partner and taking apart how he did it\nHere's\nToli's own bountified dating profile\n(with a much larger bounty ^_^).\nA few more notes:\nIntroductions can be done through\nany channel\n.\nI can stop taking new submissions for this bounty at any time (but, obviously, not retroactively).\nThe money is to incentivize you to take the time to read my profile and recommend me to friends, and to\ngenerally reward superconnectors which I think tend to be undervalued. The money is just a bonus on top of the\ngratitude^_^\nVideo interview about my dating profile\nGeneral\nWhile I’m open to other types of relationships, this profile is written with the goal of finding someone/people to\nraise children with. I'm 32 years old (born in October 1990).\nI invite you to be yourself. I encourage you to not avoid doing anything you want to do in relation to me just\n\"because it's weird\".\nFeel free to use\nReciprocity\nto see if we\nmatch, or just reach out to me\ndirectly.\nThere’s some information I like to have about prospects early on that might be easier to do in a survey format, or\nat least just so you know some specific explicit questions I generally have, you can see my\nDate me survey\n. Feel free to be very explicit and to the point with\nme (or not). You can send me your own questions.\nLooks\nHere are some more pictures:\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7\n.\nI measure 188 cm (6'2)\nand weigh 87.1 kg (192 lbs).\nRelationship structure and attraction\nI’m open to various structures, although I prefer if most of the relationship energy goes towards the family.\nI’m panromantic. I’m generally much more sexually attracted towards females. Romantic and sexual attraction is a\nplus.\nRelationship\nI would like a partner with whom I can connect deeply\n, know each other very well and develop\ngreat models of each other, share about what's going on in our lives, and be open about our internal\nexperiences. Provide support in each other's goals and aspirations, have each other's back, and deeply trust\neach other, and care about each other. Giving each other's affection.\nBe a team working together\n. Defaulting to assuming any issues that might arise isn't being done\nmaliciously, and being comfortable bringing them up and collaboratively working on them. Being resilient, and\nworking hard to address any potential issues. Trying hard to not split / live separately while raising children.\nIdeally being open to being lifelong partners, and if distance (emotional, physical, etc.) became wanted, still\nremain there for each other.\nSpending time together\n. In terms of spending time together, I might lean towards spending a bit\nless time together than the median couple. I like spending time with a partner by working on common projects,\ntalking about our day, cuddling, messing around, sharing meals, and doing exercise / sports. I\ndon’t like to go out regularly, but maybe it’s because I just haven’t found the right activities.\nAbout me\nReviews\n. I’ve had\nsome reviews\nwhich I think\nare relevant here. I also had a very public relationship with\nCarissa\n, so checking our posts could give you some peak\ninto what being with me is like.\nValues\n. I’m a very principled person. Honesty is very important for me. In terms of moral\nphilosophy, I’m leaning towards deontological-threshold negative preference-weighted life utilitarianism.\nCommunication style\n.\nI lean ask/tell culture. I’m rather\ngood at guess culture\n, and like using it sometimes, but it’s important to me that my partner is able to\nmake their needs known explicitly if I fail at reading them, and be okay with me doing the same. I want someone\nthat is open to receiving feedback — I personally love feedback. I strongly dislike “deny culture” — where\nsomeone says something that I need to deny, instead of asking me. I’m leaning more towards\ncold culture\n.\nFun\n. I like adventures and challenges. Not that I do those a lot, but I love them when I do.\nIllustrative examples: I find it exhilarating to sleep naked in a cold forest, and I love doing DIY Impractical\nJokers (\nthis one\nabout dating profile\n😅), exploring abandoned buildings, and doing food fights^^ I\ngenerally like going\nout of my comfort zone and trying new things. I like roleplaying. I like creating things.\nVibe\n. I'm often told I have a calming effect. I can inhabit other vibes, but I often inhabit\nthat one.\nHabits\n. I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t smoke. I don’t take any drugs.\nKnowledge\n(outside profession). I’ve read a fair amount about topics related to economics,\nmoral philosophy, futurism, effective altruism, LessWrong, rationality, and transhumanism.\nConflict resolution\n.\nHere are some\nstrategies I like to use\n.\nVideos\n. Here are recent videos of me:\ndiscussion with Malcolm\n,\ncircling\n,\nmore circling\n,\nauthentic relating games\n(biased sample\nbased on what\ntends to be streamed).\nOkCupid Questions\n. I’ve answered many\nOkCupid questions\n— most of them are\nvery old and a lot aren’t up-to-date, but you can still check them out.\nMore\n. To know more about me, I invite you to go the traditional route – ie. stalking me; wait,\nno, I mean 1 on 1 interactions :P. You can easily stalk me though; I notably have a lot on Facebook and on my\nwebsite (\nhttps://matiroy.com\n) – feel free to send a friend request. You can\nanswer\nthis survey\nto let me know other information you would like me to include on this profile.\nLocation\nI have a medium preference to work towards a US citizenship (ie. I’m Canadian).\nI would prefer to live in Central or North America longterm, but short-term I'm more flexible.\nI'm totally okay with meeting remotely. I can also easily travel around, and will be travelling in the US\nstarting in April.\nChildren\nGenetic code and surrogate parents\nI would like to have children using embryo/gamete selection. Can I pitch you the idea? It'll be a fun conversation if nothing else^_^\nI’m fertile: I’ve done a\nsemen analysis and\ndonated sperm leading to 3 live births\n.\nI’m also open to using surrogates — I think it could actually be valuable to have 2 (or more) children at a time.\nNumber\nI want at least 2-4 children\n, but my desire for the number of children scales almost linearly\nwith wealth, so I would like it if having 6+ children was on the table.\nUpbringing\nI would like to share responsibilities ~equally related to taking care of our children (money, time, etc.).\nI would like to have an au pair, nanny, and/or live-in maid, unless we’re more than 2 parents / adults raising\nour children.\nI have a predisposition towards liking giving a lot of autonomy / independence / responsibilities to children.\nI think it makes sense to give children the option to homeschool if/when they seem sufficiently\nautonomous and if/when we have the capacity to support that. I can also see traditional schooling, boarding\nschools, and other options being more valuable depending on our situation. I care about providing the tools for\nour children to be successful.\nJust like I record all my life,\nI would like to record all the life of our children\n, at least\nin some ways at least until they can make their own decision (because I think this might be important for\nidentity\npreservation\n, as well as useful for\nother reasons\n).\nI would like to\nsign up our children for\ncryonics\n.\nI would like our children to learn English as a first language.\nI might speak to them in French\nso they also know French.\nI don’t mind whether you or our children eat animal products, at least until they can make their own choices\n(I’m just mentionning that in case you know I have an\nbivalvegan diet\nand you were wondering).\nFinances\nYou can see my\nresume\nfor information on my career.\nI often think in terms of ROI when I spend money. I like saving a lot because of the\npower of\ncompounding investments\n.\nPersonality I’m interested in\n(Which also corresponds to my personality.)\nMain traits I generally like (sort of in order):\nHonest\nValues living\nTruth-seeking; self-reflective\nProductive\nEmotionally stable; regulate their anger\nMentally healthy, low addiction\nIntelligent\nLongtermist\nTransparent\nCaring\nProsocial\nConfident"

      "fullText": "﻿Date me?  \r\n\r\n\r\n* Hello.\r\n* I am David.\r\n* Date me?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything you read here resonates with you or makes you think maybe we should go on a date, message me! There’s a lot of potential upside and very little downside.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to make one of these yourself, here is a template.\r\n\tVital statistics\r\n1. I’m 30 and male.\r\n2. Mainly gynephilic, with some exceptions.\r\n3. I live in London and am pretty settled here.\r\n4. Poly (what's that?) with one partner (Amber) who I live with (her other boyfriend also lives here).\r\n5. Until recently I worked as a software developer; now I’m running a conference on effective altruism\r\n6. I’d like to have children.\r\nWhat I am like\r\n* Cuddly, warm, affectionate\r\n* I have a very calm disposition, low anxiety, low neuroticism, sometimes even a flat affect if tired.\r\n* Sometimes people can’t tell if I’m joking.\r\n* Quite laughy.\r\n* I don’t think of myself as especially intro- or extroverted. I have been known to start chatting to strangers. I don’t do well at massive parties where I know nobody (will bail and go home).\r\n* Often distracted by linguistic curios. (There was a period in my late teens/early twenties when I was distracted by the subject for 3 years.)\r\nThings I like\r\n1. Music. I studied the clarinet here for two years before deciding it wasn’t the life for me. Here is some music I’ve written. I’m working on a new one at the moment. I’m very lucky to have access to a piano at home, it increases my quality of life by a lot. I also sing in choirs and like going to small gigs (often folk).\r\n2. I recently started going bouldering and I think it’s my new favourite thing.\r\n3. Writing silly poems.\r\n4. I’m quite into effective altruism and thinking about ways to increase the impact I have on the world (mainly by donating money, and by volunteering my time as a software developer).\r\n5. Creative writing. Here is a post I’m particularly proud of.\r\n6. I really, really like hugs.\r\n7. Improv games.\r\n8. Reading, particularly science fiction.\r\n9. Camping/hiking/the outdoors.\r\n10. Currently neglected hobbies: dancing, playing board games, drawing.\r\nWhat (I hope) you are like\r\nIf multiple of the below describe you, we should definitely at least chat. Each of them is a strong plus. But these are not essential, strict criteria. Far from it. They're clues. The most important thing is that we like each other and get on well.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou, my ideal person, are probably:\r\n* relatively nerdy,\r\n* like making jokes,\r\n* like to be physically affectionate,\r\n* like playing with ideas,\r\n* hold your opinions lightly,\r\n* are motivated to help others\r\n* and seek new experiences,\r\n* are curious,\r\n* and put in an unusual amount of effort to believe true things (‘good epistemics’). \r\n* In terms of gender presentation, you probably are relatively mixed or neutral. I’m most often attracted to women at the masculine end of the spectrum. Trans folk welcome.\r\n* You enjoy creating things in some way, whether in writing, artistically, or something else.\r\n* There needs to be an intellectual spark. For example, you enjoy talking about abstract ideas, gaining insight about the world, speculating, metacognition, building analogies, and delving into your confusion.\r\nForwardly Asked Questions\r\nWhy make a ‘date me’ page? What even is a ‘date me’ page? Where is your sense of propriety?\r\n* Dating sites are really bad at selecting for the kind of person I might want to date. But ‘real life’ is relatively good at this. I hope that by making this page I make it easier for people I meet in real life to know that I’m open to going on dates, find out about what that might be like, and reach out. This is my way to let people feel empowered to make a move even if it might not work out. I am way too timid about these things myself precisely because I don’t know if telling a friend I like-like them would damage our friendship. It would be tragic to miss out on a great thing because we were both too timid. So this is me giving you permission, and promising not to let it change our friendship.\r\n* Also, all the cool kids are doing it.\r\nWhat are you looking for in your romantic life?\r\n* Love. It’s one of the greatest joys in life and makes the world beautiful.\r\n* While I’m interested in exploring relationships at any level of casualness, I’m most actively seeking something long term, ultimately to be one of the foundations of my life. Ideally, we would eventually live together.\r\n* At the same time, I don't want to fuse with another person; we'd have our own lives, pastimes, interests, and friends/partners.\r\n* I’m not interested in indefinitely-long-distance things.\r\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\n* I’d like to be part of a bustling community of friends who throw parties and regularly cook for each other at each other’s houses and live near each other or together. Hopefully with some casual music-making involved. Willing to move to make this happen. The model could be setting up a group house, or cooperating to live strategically close to our friends.\r\n* Somewhat related to building a community, I’d probably like to start a family. A family is just a tiny, very close-knit community. (Aside: why do people always talk about wanting to start families, but never talk about wanting to finish one?)\r\n* Noticing the passage of time and my desire to start a family is what triggered making this post. I’m also open to the idea of co-parenting with someone without a romantic relationship. We would need to be close friends, of course, to make it a stable partnership. I’m not convinced there is a huge chasm between romance and platonic relationships, as opposed to a spectrum.\r\nWhat face do I have?\r\nThis one (next page). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider this to be a smile - others may say what they wish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto credit: Sally Mears\r\nWe were amused by the gate standing by itself    \r\nWhat is it like dating me?\r\nIt’s hard for me to say from the inside, obviously, but some things you can expect are:\r\n* Attentiveness\r\n* Sincerity\r\n* Cuddles <3\r\n* With serious partners, I like to set aside regular time to talk about how the relationship is going, problem-solve any things that are bugging us, and brainstorm ways we can make the relationship even better than it already is. It really enhances relationships in my experience. Recommended!\r\n* Conflict management:\r\n   * I don't appreciate people with a quick temper.\r\n   * I will want to debrief until we get to the bottom of what’s going on, and make sure we both feel heard.\r\n   * I’m somewhat conflict-avoidant (I seem to not really have a shouty mode), but these days I think I’m quite good at verbalizing when I’m annoyed or angry.\r\n* They noticed my communication skills at work:  \r\nWhat are your thoughts on sex?\r\n   * For me, while I love it, sex is not an essential part of a relationship (especially when one has the possibility of multiple partners, such that something not provided by partner A can be provided by B).\r\n   * That said, I want to be desired, and might not be happy unless you seem somewhat into me physically.\r\n   * I enjoy the process of discovering what we like, and using words quite a lot to guide each other/ask for things. \r\n   * I won't say much about frequency as it varies by person, and over time.\r\n   * I'm not kinky, but to the extent that I am, I'm more subby than dommy.\r\nThings that might be dealbreakers for you\r\n   * I’m quite messy. If you’re neat, we might need to create Inventive Solutions like not living together, hiring a cleaner, or not dating. I pull my weight around the house where agreements are struck, but have low standards by inclination.\r\n   * I’m not very physically fit. If you want a toned body, I can’t provide that. I am trying to live healthily and maintain my current weight (78kg, 5’7”) but I am not and will never be thin.\r\nValues\r\nMy most important values are:\r\n   * Actively try to make the world a better place. Take the well-being of others very seriously, and be willing to take significant personal action to that end. I’ve taken the Giving What We Can pledge to donate 10% of my income to effective charities.\r\n   * Desire to believe true things and let go of cherished but false beliefs. Try to avoid over- (and under-) confidence, deliberately seek out opposing points of view, be open to strange ideas. (‘Good epistemics’.)\r\n   * Integrity: be honest and trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love it if we could bond over some of these values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other, less important values are atheism and veg(eteri)anism. These are only important to me in a partner insofar as I treat them as signs of general factors already mentioned: of taking unfamiliar ideas and others’ welfare seriously. You might embody those in other ways, in which case that's fine.\r\nAesthetics\r\nClothes\r\nI wear them, but I object to dress codes. I like dungarees. I get almost all my t-shirts from boodle at this point.\r\nMusic\r\n   * Musicians who I’ve seen live more than once: Louis Cole/Knower, Daisy Chute, Amanda Palmer.\r\n   * None of those are classical, but classical music (especially of the Romantic era) is the foundation of my taste since my teens, with folk and jazz and alt-pop layered on top. That comes out more in what music I play than what music I consume.\r\n   * All my Spotify likes to 13/11/21, sorted alphanumerically for your pleasure\r\nHumour\r\nSome people really get my humour; other people don’t. The high variance life. But that means when people gel with my sense of humour, they really gel! I’ve had multiple people say to me words to the following effect:  \r\nTODO: Get Holly’s comment framed and put it in pride of place in my room\r\nSo I’m going to keep on with the current humour style. My humour is silly, sometimes dry/deadpan, and quite wordplay-heavy with a good pinch of syntactic ambiguity thrown in too.\r\nFood\r\nFood is nice; I’ll eat it, but it’s not one of my main interests. I spend most of my time being a vegan, for animal abuse reasons, making exceptions when it doesn’t seem worth the expense (e.g. I’m not paying 25p for a cafe to use oat milk instead of cow’s milk). You don’t need to be vegan or vegetarian, as mentioned.\r\nI’ve got to the end of the document. What now?\r\nIf you’ve read this far, we probably have a decent chance of hitting it off, so message me! If not, feel free to share it with someone you think might be interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you found this page via OKCupid, it's a good idea to email me as I check that a lot more often.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re nervous about being direct and we’re Facebook friends, you can use this site to indicate interest, and if it’s mutual we’ll both be notified. But ideally you’ll bite the bullet and reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr if you are less enthusiastic or just want to take a more cautious/experimental approach, maybe just invite me to more things, try to be my friend, and see if we get on in that context!\r\n\r\n\r\nCould I have written this better? Let me know!\r\nFootnotes\r\nPoly?\r\n   * Poly.\r\n   * This means that, by mutual agreement, any of my partners can date anyone.\r\n   * This doesn’t mean you are expected to date anyone I happen to date. It’s just me. I don’t expect my friends to be friends with each other unless they want to be; this is like that.\r\n   * In practice I have one partner, who I’ve been dating since late 2018.\r\n   * Here is a good poly FAQ.\r\n“A shouty mode”?\r\nNot knowing how to be angry by shouting was the reason I gave as a child for not wanting to become a teacher. That was pretty accurate, I was a terrible teacher, unable to control the class."

Currently living in New York City but leaning against settling down here permanently, and likes the idea of living somewhere family-friendly (that isn’t a suburb).\nDetails\nBy nerdy, I mean that I tend to get into phases where I get weirdly excited about things. To take a few random recent examples: Which countries have the best and most cost-effective transit systems[1], and urbanism and city planning\nmore generally\n[2]. Computability theory[3], or\nalternate computation models\n, like what its implications would look like for a world that had regular time travel. Acrobatics.\nThe history of clothes making[4]. Making homemade liquor.\nBuilding this took a surprisingly long time\nCats[5]. Elaborate improvised constructs.\nAlso, glacier climbing\nWhat a world would look like if time travel was possible but constrained by computability limits, except that cats could effectively get around them by having weak preferences, and the whole thing ran on a hybrid Miyazaki/Moomins/FF7 aesthetic. And so on.\nBy family-oriented, I mean, well – I like happy families. And I like kids, and really want kids, and like the kind of family/tribal structures where people of different ages actually interact.\nI am slightly trad in some ways, by which I mean something like enjoying some traditions and traditional attitudes but not actually being particularly religious. So I like Friday night family dinners (with the candles and the nice tablecloth[6]), and I like casual gender norms (In that, say, I prefer the sound of “my wife” to “my spouse”), but don’t do regular prayers or really keep kosher (except I don’t eat pork).\nFor stories – I wrote\nthis one about first contact\n, or\nthis one about bike lanes\n. For song translations, I mostly do Israeli folk songs (like\nthis one\n, or\nthis one\n).\nLife/Relationship Goals\nMost of all, I want a family. I want a good happy partnership relationship, and I want a bunch of kids. There’s probably practical constraints on how many kids I could practically have or handle, but in principle, I’m a fan of the idea of having lots of kids. I think I would be a good dad.\nI currently live in New York and work doing vague finance and programming stuff. I like it here for now, but I wouldn’t want to settle down permanently, or raise kids here. Where I want to end up is a hard question – for having kids, I’d want to be somewhere clean and pedestrian-friendly, where the kids can walk safely by themselves to get around or play outside or whatnot. Sometimes I think about going back to Israel, but there are other places that meet those conditions. (Financially, I do have more than enough to support a family, including if I was married to someone who wanted to be a homemaker or work nonprofit or whatever, or to take a few years off for that matter).\nMy ideal relationship involves sharing random ideas that get us excited off each other, cooking or going on hikes together, randomly messaging each other cat pictures, developing a pool of shared references and frames that becomes a little like a shared language, spiderman kisses (that is, where one or both of the people doing the kissing are hanging upside-down), and eventually raising a bunch of kids together.\nAlso, occasional backpacking trips where we wind up cooking improvised pancakes in random abandoned cabins.\nYou\n?\n[7]\nIf the above part sounds appealing, you should try to contact me! You can email me (\nshaked.koplewitz@gmail.com\n, preferred), find me on facebook, whatever.\nSee? Very welcoming\nI like the idea of social proof – if we know people in common, you can talk to me through them, or talk to them about whether they think we’d work.\nProperties common in people I have good relationships with:\nGetting delighted by things. Probably the biggest single factor, although it can be hard to describe. If you’re the sort of person who would build the food pyramid I mentioned above, or give names to random wildlife, or stop to look in random windows because you’re curious what the people inside live like, or like to think about the logistics of feeding a continent of sentient hamsters, we are likely to get along and you should give me a call.\nCompatible life goals. This one is pretty obvious, I guess.\nAbility to resolve conflicts. I’m not always great at immediately noticing when something is bothering someone, but I\ndo\nlisten when people talk to me about things. It helps a lot in a relationship, if you’re someone who can bring up things that bother you, and we can talk it through and solve it.\nHaving initiative, and dreams, and like to do things.They don’t have to be shared interests – I just like people who have interests they get excited about.\nFinally, if you do want to contact me but aren’t sure how, ideas for conversation starters\nWhat would the world look like if it had time-travelling cats?\nIf you had the choice to be turned into a group of hamsters, how many hamsters would it take for you to prefer being the group of hamsters to being human?\nWhat’s something you deeply care about, or something that would make your life or your neighborhood or the world better?\nIf you could be in any sort of place imaginable right now, where would you be?\nAny random thing you’ve been thinking about lately\nJust “Hi” is also good!\nExternal references (things I get excited about that I didn’t make)\n[1]\nhttps://transitcosts.com/\n[2]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaJf01RPphU\n[3]\nhttps://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book\n[4]\nhttps://acoup.blog/2021/03/05/collections-clothing-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-high-fiber/\n[5] In order: Harvey and Olivia (top left), Uriel (napping) and Larry and Rosie (my ex step-pets, which is a delightful palindrome).\n[6]\nhttps://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/bring-back-the-sabbath/\n[7] Okay this one was probably a stretch.\nShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nLike\nLoading...\nRelated\nPost navigation\nPrevious Post\nPublic Transit in the Hollownest\nNext Post\nLessons from covid predictions: Always use multiple models\n3 thoughts on “Shaked’s Dating Profile”\nLea\nsays:\nJanuary 28, 2022 at 4:46 am\nsuch a smart move to put the cats at the end!\nLike\nLike\nReply\nshakeddown\nsays:\nJanuary 28, 2022 at 5:49 pm\nThey are very excellent cats.\nLike\nLike\nReply\nMelany\nsays:\nMay 3, 2022 at 11:10 pm\nHahaha… clever!

      "fullText": "﻿Hello! My name is Kathy Garcia and I am looking for a primary partner and co-parent. I don't yet have children but very much want to in the near future. \r\n\r\nIt is not required (though definitely an option) that this person also biologically father these children. For legal convenience related to co-parenting I do probably want us to be legally married, but I'd want our relationship to be open/polyamorous.\r\n\r\nI want this person to be my primary collaborator on the project of being a human in the world, as well as the project of child-rearing. I want to be open about everything with them and have them do the same with me, and help each other to solve our problems, large and small. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to any gender, race, body type, etc.\r\nAbout me\r\nBasics  \r\n32 years old, 5'8\", 130-150 lb. Ethnic background is 25% Mexican, 75% mixed Western European.\r\n\r\nAFAB, genderfluid, they/them, pansexual, polyamorous, demisexual, autistic, ADHD, secular, rationalist, submissive. Happy to talk more about what any of these mean to me.\r\n\r\nI am based in Oakland, CA and would like to stay here for at least another year or two but don't feel tied to it in the long term. \r\n\r\nI graduated from Caltech in 2015 with a B.S. in Computation and Neural Systems. After that I bounced around a few healthcare-related startups, then spent 6 years at Benchling building software for biotech, pharma, and academic biology labs, then was briefly at AI safety nonprofit METR, and am now back in tech-for-biotech at Mithrl.\r\n\r\nProfiles: OkCupid, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub\r\nPros\r\n\r\n\r\n* Kindness/Compassion. I care very deeply about people, both as a class and as individuals. If we have a long-term relationship I will come to care very deeply about you.\r\n* Loyalty. I will be fiercely dedicated to making our relationship work and to any agreements we make as part of our relationship contract.\r\n* Openness to Experience. One of my friends once said that of everyone he knew, I was the one who would most literally \"try anything once\". I really love novelty and will probably be down to try anything with you that you'd like to get me into. This includes sex and kink, but also hobbies and other activities.\r\n* General intelligence. Hard evidence for this: I graduated from Caltech and have been successful in my career as a Software Engineer. I have also had my IQ tested a couple of times and scored about 140.\r\n* Practical Skills. I have a variety of these, which seems relatively rare in the communities I find myself in. I can also pick up new ones fairly quickly. I am not an expert in any of them but good enough to do a respectable job. Here are a few of them:\r\n   * Cooking\r\n   * Sewing\r\n   * Soldering\r\n   * Furniture assembly\r\n   * Home maintenance/repair\r\n   * First Aid and basic medicine\r\n* Financial stability. I was an early member of a successful tech startup. I am trying to avoid lifestyle creep, but I generally expect that I and my immediate family will be materially comfortable for a long time. If you also have significant income I will expect you to contribute some to the child-rearing project, but I'm open to partners who are low-income as well. \r\n* Knowledgeable about child-rearing. I have known my entire life that I wanted to be a parent and have read quite a bit about how to care for babies and children. That being said, I have minimal practical childcare experience.\r\n* Comfortable with scary, gross, or dark things. I can deal with insects, spiders, traumatic injury, bodily fluids, most emergency situations, and death in a calm, clinical, and effective manner. There are also very few topics that are taboo to talk about. It would be great if this was also true of you.\r\n* Good relationship with my parents. This is some evidence of my ability to maintain relationships long-term. (EDIT: My mother has passed away since time of writing. I still have a good relationship with my father and his new wife!)\r\n* Cute and cuddly. I think I'm decently conventionally attractive, but what I really mean here is that I enjoy leaning into cutesiness, especially in tone of voice and turns of phrase. Partners tend to find me adorable, though of course there's huge selection bias there. I also love cuddling.\r\n* Paperwork. I actually like doing paperwork and will be happy to manage yours and any that arises for the children.\r\n* Style. Someone once told me that I have \"an irreverent style that is highly marketable.\" It was the strangest compliment I've ever received but I don't think it's inaccurate. People often seem delighted by my sense of humor and turns of phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\nCons\r\n* Chronic pain. I have occipital neuralgia, which causes a really distracting form of pain in my head, neck, and shoulders. I also have some lower back pain. It's rarely debilitating, but there are times I need to stop doing a physical activity before it's done, and there are times I need to just lie in bed for a few hours. I am in the process of getting treatment for this and have some hope that it will not be a problem in the long term, but this is far from guaranteed.\r\n* Mild emotional instability. I will sometimes get very upset and want you to spend time and effort and attention on comforting me. It's not that I take actions I don't endorse or that I turn into \"someone else\" in these states, just, if you're not comfortable with comforting me when I cry we probably aren't a good match. \r\n* Executive dysfunction/akrasia. I go through phases where it becomes very difficult for me to get anything done. This responds very well to social pressure though, so if you just tell me \"hey go do the thing\" I will probably go do it. In fact, if you're willing to do a lot of this for me that would be especially great.\r\n* Mild addictive personality. Every once in a while I find something that really gives me dopamine and get too into it. So far none of these addictions have had major impact on my life and all have resolved on their own after a while, and I am careful to keep it that way. But it's likely I'll continue to have phases where I spend all of my free time and perhaps a bit too much money on one specific activity, and occasionally overindulge on food or alcohol. I actually am pretty okay with this and would not want you to stop me unless it was having a negative impact on you, me or the children.\r\n* Abandonment issues. I am pretty afraid and insecure about the idea that someone will leave me in a time of need. I will likely need regular reassurance that you still like me and are committed to our relationship. If you have an avoidant attachment style or are not comfortable reassuring me, we likely are not a good match.\r\n* Other mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD, and autism. I take Adderall 5 days a week. In particular - until some time in 2014 I considered myself very mentally healthy and happy. Then I went through a rough breakup, graduated college and was thrust into adulthood, Trump got elected, and my internal experience got worse and worse. I am past the peak of this now and am optimistic about future improvement, but it seems likely that I'll have at least some phases of high anxiety and/or depression for the rest of my life. \r\n* Messiness. I am fairly messy and disorganized. I'm willing to work on this but it seems unlikely it'll ever stop being a problem, since it's been true my whole life and is likely related to my ADHD. If this bothers you a lot we probably aren't a good fit. If you're willing to clean up for me that would be amazing. In the future when I settle down, I will probably just hire someone(s) to clean up after me.\r\n* Lack of physical fitness. I'm not very strong and don't have very much stamina. I can get shit done when necessary but will likely need help lifting very heavy objects and might decline things like long hikes or strenuous sexual positions.  I am willing to work on this and would love it if you motivated me to get regular exercise.\r\n* Bad at scheduling and punctuality. If we set a date there's a high likelihood that I'll be 5-15 minutes late, and a nontrivial likelihood that I'll forget about it entirely. Again this is something I'm willing to work on but also have been trying to improve my whole life and seen only minimal progress. If something is *really* important, I do generally manage to make it, though.\r\n* Body hair. My body hair is thick and dark. I have had laser hair removal on my legs which thinned it out but did not get rid of enough of it for my legs to not look hairy. I don't remove any of it regularly and I don't think I'll start, because I don't have bandwidth for another regular hygiene activity, so if this bothers you we probably aren't a good match.\r\n* Sexual hangups. This one needs to be broken down into a few bullet points:\r\n   * Demisexuality. I'm demisexual, which to me means that I never feel attracted to anyone I don't know, but when I know someone and relate to them well I almost always feel some attraction to them. It will probably be a while before I feel that way about you.\r\n   * Low sex drive. In general even once I do feel attraction I still have a pretty low sex drive most of the time. When I'm not actively in a relationship I can go many months without sex and it does not bother me at all. All of my past long-term relationships have fallen into the following pattern: At the beginning of the relationship, I'm excited about having sex multiple times a day and we do. Once the NRE (new relationship energy) wears off I'm a lot less interested in sex and my partner starts pressuring me about it. The pressure makes me want it even less and we enter a vicious cycle. I am not sure whether the cycle is started by me losing interest or by them beginning to pressure me.\r\n   * Pain during sex. I'm pretty sure my genitals are more sensitive to pain than average. It's easy for someone to accidentally cause pain while trying to cause pleasure. I'm not sure if this has medical cause, I've been examined a few times and been told there's nothing obviously wrong.\r\n   * Anxiety around giving feedback. I've had a lot of experiences where I tried giving feedback (including that someone was hurting me) and had my partner not care, not be able to figure out how to do better, or turn the interaction into me doing emotional labor for them because they felt bad about not being good enough. This has trained my brain that giving feedback will be useless or worse, and so I often just don't, including gritting my teeth through painful sex that I'm not enjoying. I will likely need a lot of encouragement and understanding around this, at least at first.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeutrals\r\n\r\n\r\n* Very Direct. Probably most neurotypical people perceive me as too blunt. I don't enjoy having to pepper in niceties in order to get my point across, and will only do it when I have bandwidth to spare. Of course other people find this refreshing.\r\n* Extroverted. I process things through socializing, and go to medium-to-large social events often. I would love it if you accompanied me to these events, and if you don't want to go to them at all ever, we may not be a good match.\r\n* Strong preference for Tell Culture. 80% of the time, you will have a better model of your own thoughts and preferences than I do, and I will have a better model of mine. Therefore I don't want to spend a lot of effort on guessing what you want or what's going through your head. That being said, there is the other 20% of the time, and it certainly is very nice when people are able to make correct guesses. I'm definitely interested in forming good models of my partners and sometimes surprising them with things they didn't know they wanted. But I don't want that to be the primary dynamic of the relationship.\r\n* Pets. I like cats a lot and am okay with small dogs. Large dogs scare me a bit and I would not want to live with one. I'm probably neutral-to-positive on most other pets.\r\n* Hobbies. Here are some of mine, it would be cool if you share some of them and we can do them together.\r\n   * Board games\r\n   * Puzzle hunts\r\n   * Crossword puzzles\r\n   * Makeup and Skincare\r\n   * Alternative Fashion\r\n   * Alternative Music (especially pop punk and power metal)\r\n   * Cosplay\r\n   * Star Trek (DS9 > TNG > VOY > SNW > PIC > PRO > DIS > ENT. Have not seen much of TOS, TAS, or Lower Decks. The Kelvin Timeline movies are terrible.)\r\n   * Travel\r\n   * Burner culture (as in Burning Man)\r\n   * Counterculture in general\r\n* Very Online. I spend almost all of my time on the Internet and am never without my phone. I'm deep into meme culture, especially on TikTok. \r\n* Army Brat. My father was in the Army when I was growing up and we moved every few years. I have moved a total of 14 times in my life, not counting moving between rooms in college. I have lived all over the country as well as in Germany for 5 years. I speak German - I was once fluent but am now a little rusty.\r\n* Gender. Around 80% of the time I am not thinking about gender and trying to apply it to myself feels jarring, so I don't think I have one. Around 15% of the time, especially during penetrative sex, I feel quite feminine. The remaining 5% of the time I feel fairly masculine. I don't expect to be treated differently in these modes, but I do want to be referred to with they/them pronouns. That being said, I am happy with my AFAB body and don't plan to use hormones or gender affirming surgery to alter it.\r\n* Submissive and Kinky. I respond very well to someone else taking the lead or giving instructions in bed and I enjoy many forms of sensation play, bondage, impact play, and pain play. I don't consider myself a masochist as I don't get pleasure from pain in and of itself, but as a sign of submission or exploration of my limits it can be very fun. I am up for kinky play much more often than I am up for genital-focused sex.\r\nChild-rearing plans\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to have at least one biological child (maybe two, but I want to wait and see how I feel about having a second after I have one. I am also open to the idea of adopting the second one.) I want to carry and birth this child myself, ideally via vaginal birth. I see this as one of the big fundamental human experiences and would like to have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to biologically father the child, you of course need to produce viable sperm, but I will also want both of us to submit to genetic counseling. You need to not carry the genes for any serious genetic disorders nor have family history of any serious heritable conditions. I am not sure yet if I'd also want to do embryo selection, and this may depend on our genetic compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to biologically father the child, I will likely get sperm from a sperm bank, and you can have some input on what qualities we are looking for in a donor. I'm also open to conceiving a child via sex with a friend or other partner who is interested in being the biological father, but I don't have any candidates right now.\r\n\r\nMy actual ideal situation for child-rearing would be living with a group of like-minded people who are all communally raising children, and who may be in a connected polycule. But finding such an arrangement and keeping it stable is difficult, so I am open to other arrangements (including something fairly close to the \"nuclear family\", although I would still hope to keep more outside connections and partners than is typical in that situation).\r\n\r\nIt is important to me that the two of us share the parenting labor fairly equitably, and that you involve yourself in the child's life. I am not sure what I want to do about childcare if we both work - I may take a sabbatical, or we may hire a nanny. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn parenting, my top priority will be the child's current and future subjective well-being, as opposed to their intelligence, earning potential, impact, or any other specific outcome. Of course there will be times when I guide them toward those things as well, but it will never take priority over trying to raise a happy, healthy individual. It is important to me that you do the same. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople keep telling me that I should include something about my schooling preferences here, but I am open to a variety of options, as long as they seem like they will serve the children well. I probably lean toward private schooling or homeschooling, and would be against religious schooling.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to gender the children until they tell us what gender they identify as, and it is important to me that you are willing to do this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to those implied above, here are a few more things that would be dealbreakers for me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* You don't have solid conflict resolution skills, and arguments will continually end poorly.\r\n* Your politics are right-wing in the sense of privileging markets or other existing social orders over human flourishing, autonomy, and well-being.\r\n* Your opinions, political and otherwise, do not change based on evidence.\r\n* You do not treat me as an equal.\r\n* You are not ready, willing, and able to spend a significant amount of time, effort, and attention on our relationship and on child-rearing.\r\n* You lie often.\r\n* There are many common tasks and situations that you can't handle without help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you got through all of this and think you might be interested in a connection, please contact me at yandereko@gmail.com. I look forward to talking to you!"

      "fullText": "My dating profile\nHome\n•\nWritings\nMy dating profile\nBy Brian Tomasik\nFirst published:\n2020 Sep 20\n. Last nontrivial update:\n2023 Aug 24\n.\nUpdate\nAs of fall 2023, after having this profile up for nearly three years, I think I probably don't want a relationship after all, though maybe this will change again some day. :)\nThe main issue is that relationships take up a fair amount of time, often more than you expect they will. I already feel stressed by the number of tasks I have to do and the finite energy I have for completing them. A relationship adds more items to my todo list, and even though most of the time spent on a relationship is fun, it's an additional firehose of responsibility that I can't just turn off when I'm too busy. Solo hobbies are better in this regard because I can do as much or as little of them as I choose at any given time.\nI never want to have children or pets because I don't want the responsibility of being the primary caretaker for another creature. Likewise, I plausibly don't want the responsibility of being the primary caretaker for another adult human. I like helping people from time to time, but being the main source of companionship and emotional support for another person can begin to feel burdensome—unless that other person is extremely introverted and self-sufficient.\nI'm keeping this page up as an archive. Feel welcome to still write to me if you want to, such as because you think you might be an excellent match or because you think a long-term relationship could require minimal time in most future scenarios. (I'm not really interested in short-term relationships.)\nBelow is the original dating profile.\n❄\n❄\n❄\nThis is a dating profile for myself. It's written partly out of academic interest, as an autobiographical portrait of my current life, and partly with the goal of possibly finding a life partner. I have so many preferences about my lifestyle that the number of people for whom I would be a suitable romantic partner is extremely small. Nonetheless, if you happen to find what I wrote appealing, feel free to\ncontact me\nabout this topic. (If you're shy about revealing your identity, you could write to me using a pseudonymous email account.)\nSummary\nText fields on dating websites for describing oneself and one's relationship preferences are almost always too short. This page allows me to expand on what I'm looking for if I pursue a romantic relationship.\nI'm open to either an in-person or indefinite long-distance relationship. In theory I would prefer an in-person relationship, but I'm very picky about my lifestyle, so in practice an indefinite long-distance relationship may be more feasible.\nWhether the relationship is in-person or long-distance, here are some criteria to help quickly figure out if we might be compatible. I would look for\na woman (cisgender) (straight or bisexual or other orientations are fine)\nlocated anywhere in the world\nwithin roughly ~10 years of my own age (as of 2022, I'm 35 years old)\n(ideally, though not a hard requirement) either vegan or the only animal products consumed on a regular basis are dairy and beef\ninterested in animal welfare, reducing suffering, s-risks, effective altruism, philosophy, science/technology, and/or related topics\na long-term relationship, ideally one that might last forever (although given that divorce rates are high, there's a good chance it wouldn't last forever)\nlow time commitment (spending only 2-4 hours per week together in the long run on average; it would be higher during some weeks and lower in other weeks). (In the case of an in-person relationship, we might be physically in the same room for slightly more than 2-4 hours per week due to needing to coordinate practical things, put away groceries, or do other tasks together around the house. That said, I prefer to do most household chores by myself to avoid being distracted.)\nIn the case of an in-person relationship, these are some additional things I would look for:\nno kids ever (unless they don't live with us)\n(ideally, though not a hard requirement) no pets\nno smoking or illegal drugs\nbeing mindful not to accidentally crush bugs around the house, and euthanizing any bugs that we do kill\nnot doing outdoor activities together\nnot traveling together\nrarely going to events/parties together\nminimal noise and minimal interruptions\nI prefer to stay at my current house, so an in-person relationship would involve the other person being willing to eventually move to a rural part of New York State. (It would be fine if it took 5-10 years or more before we could live together.)\nIn an indefinite long-distance relationship, it's fine if you already have kids and don't want more (or at least don't want more kids fathered by me). I just wouldn't want the noise and complexity of having kids in my own house.\nI'm open to either monogamy or polyamory depending on the circumstances. I would probably prefer monogamy in an ideal world, but in practice, polyamory might be more realistic given that I don't want to spend a lot of time on a relationship.\nBecause I'm introverted and have so many uncommon lifestyle preferences, I don't mind if I remain single forever. Sometimes I think I might even prefer staying single.\nTo see my answers on other compatibility questions, visit\nmy OkCupid profile\n.\nContents\nUpdate\nSummary\nWhy a detailed dating profile?\nLong-distance vs in-person relationships\nMy quirks\nMy lifestyle\nValues\nOther compatibility topics\nAppearance\nPersonality\nBeing sugar-hungry and sugar-full\nMonogamy vs polyamory\nPolyamory for myself\nPolyamory for my partner\nAcknowledgements\nWhy a detailed dating profile?\nThere seem to be two main philosophies when it comes to dating. Some people, including me, prefer to enumerate their preferences and dealbreakers from the outset, in order to filter out incompatible people as quickly as possible. Others apparently like to \"keep an air of mystery\" in the process and get to know details about someone over the course of in-person conversations. I can understand this latter approach if you enjoy dating just for its own sake. Maybe it's similar to how I want to be surprised by the ending of a movie rather than having it spoiled. However, if your goal is to actually find a great match, it seems to me that laying out as much detail up front as possible is the better way to go. I would rather be in a nice relationship than be looking for one, so I prefer to find a good match more efficiently.\nIn that spirit, this page lays out the main compatibility issues I would have when considering a romantic relationship. I have\na lot\nof dealbreakers. I would rather be single than be in a relationship with 99.9% of potential matches, so filtering on compatibility ahead of time is pretty essential for me.\nLong-distance vs in-person relationships\nI live in a house in a rural area of upstate New York, USA. For reasons of convenience and family, I prefer not to move away from where I am now, at least not for another decade or two. However, there aren't many people near me, I don't have a car or driver's license, and I prefer not to make unnecessary car trips because this squishes and splats bugs (and I don't want to cause bugs to suffer). So for the short run, any relationship I have would almost certainly be mostly long-distance. I\ndislike traveling\n, but I could probably stand to meet up in person about once a year if the person were far away (including international), or maybe twice a year if the person lived in the northeastern USA. For me, an ideal approach to long-distance communication in the long run might be, say, a 2-hour video or voice call once a week (or maybe a 4-hour call every other week), plus short written messages roughly daily or every other day. (In the first few months of the relationship, we might be excited and want to talk a lot more than this.)\nSometimes, if I'm in a productive mood or am otherwise not interested in socializing, I like to avoid checking my messages for several days in a row. If I'm ready to get useful things done, I don't want to waste time on talking, and I worry that even a small amount of talking might break my focus and lead me to want to talk more. This is similar to the reason why I avoid eating even a single bite of food when I'm not hungry: if I eat even a small amount, it may shift my body into eating mode, causing me to become hungry. I imagine that this tendency to not check my messages as often as most people do would be pretty annoying for many partners. There's an OkCupid question: \"Is it a requirement that you communicate every day with your significant other (via phone, text, in person, whatever)?\" I find that many women say it is a requirement, but that would be close to a dealbreaker for me.\nIf the relationship lasted a while and the other person was open to moving to my somewhat ugly rural house, I would consider that option as well. However, living together raises numerous additional complications, such as minimizing noise, avoiding interrupting each other too often, and resolving conflicting preferences about the house itself. These complications might be worth it for the benefits of being together in person, including more physical contact and ease/privacy of communication.\nMy quirks\nI have a number of unusual lifestyle quirks and preferences that may cause incompatibilities. Here are some main ones:\nMy waking hours are irregular and hard to predict. One day I might be awake during daylight hours, and a few days later, I might be awake during the night. One reason for this is that my sleep sometimes gets disrupted, meaning that I sleep too little and then need to nap the next day, leading to further sleep disturbance. The other reason is that even when my sleep pattern is pretty regular from one day to the next, my waking hours may tend to creep forward by roughly an hour per day, which is made possible because I don't use an alarm clock. My sleep schedule is able to move around like this because I don't have any set working hours and keep pre-scheduled phone calls to a minimum. As a result of this irregularity, the times when I would be available to talk with a romantic partner would be variable and unpredictable.\nI can be a bit irrationally cautious about some things. For example, I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I don't like sharing towels, silverware, dishes, etc. I dislike \"double dipping\" with food. I'm nervous about getting Lyme disease from ticks that are prevalent around my house, and I spend a fair amount of time checking my body for ticks. If someone else goes outside around my house, I prefer to avoid touching them until after a thorough tick check in case they have ticks crawling on them.\nConsistent with my germaphobia, I'm\nvery cautious\nregarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs). I'm even slightly grossed out by lip kissing and would prefer kissing places that aren't bodily openings. Before having sex I would first want to do a complete array of STI tests, including for things like genital herpes that aren't always tested by default. Because of the \"window period\" for HIV testing, I would prefer for an HIV test to occur as much as half a year after the last possible HIV exposure (such as from sex with a previous partner), and I would prefer to avoid sex (even with condoms) until the test came back negative. While I think having sex before marriage is a good idea to verify sexual compatibility, I prefer not to rush into it either. Given that most people are vastly less cautious about STIs than this, I'm probably fairly irrational here, but oh well.\nI'm troubled by the\nsuffering of bugs\naround the house, and I try to euthanize injured or dying bugs, typically by putting them into a container in the freezer. While I wouldn't expect a romantic partner to actively care for bugs in this way, I would be emotionally upset by deliberate swatting, crushing, drowning, etc of bugs. In addition, I prefer to seal food scraps in a plastic container before throwing them in the trash to prevent fruit flies from breeding. I oppose composting food waste because it gives rise to thousands of bugs whose short lives inevitably end in painful deaths.\nIn many parts of the world, particularly towns and cities, the residential water supply is drawn from rivers, lakes, or reservoirs that contain numerous invertebrate animals, like copepods and rotifers. These animals die painfully as that water is withdrawn for treatment. At my current house, water is drawn instead from a deep well, which likely contains vastly less biological activity than surface waters do. If I were to move from my current house to a city, I would feel guilty about showering and washing my hands because of the numerous invertebrates it would kill.\nMy lifestyle\nYou can see some biographical information about me on\nmy home page\nand\nmy résumé\n.\nI worked at Microsoft from 2009 to 2013. I donated some of my earnings to charity but kept a lot as personal savings. At the age of 26, I \"retired\" from formal employment and instead devoted more time to blogging on my site\nEssays on Reducing Suffering\n. I'm also an advisor to some nonprofit organizations, as well as to individuals who ask me questions. I'm a well known member of the \"effective altruism\" movement. I do all of these activities unpaid, so technically I'm unemployed.\nI'm extremely introverted and can go for days without needing to talk with other people. I prefer to work on whatever I'm interested in at the moment for long stretches of uninterrupted time. Typically I do \"social\" activities like checking email and Facebook once or twice a day, usually when eating meals at my computer. I almost never leave my house, not even to go outdoors, because I don't want to crush bugs by walking outside, and there may be ticks in the grass. Plus, almost everything I want to do is indoors. (I take vitamin D supplements due to not getting much sunshine.) I spend most of my waking hours at my computer; the rest is spent lifting dumbbells, preparing food, showering, cleaning things around the house, and so on. I work at my computer standing up on a treadmill, and for 1-3 hours per day I walk slowly on the treadmill while using my computer.\nI prefer to organize items in my room the way I want them organized, and I wouldn't want other people to live in my room. Even if I shared the house with a romantic partner, I would sleep in a separate bed in a separate room to avoid being woken up by the other person and to avoid waking the other person. Plus, given my erratic waking hours, I often would not be sleeping at the same time as the other person anyway.\nIf I were to have a romantic relationship, I would prefer for my lifestyle to remain roughly the same as it is now. That's pretty feasible in the case of a long-distance relationship because it doesn't involve living with another person. For an in-person relationship, I would hope that our living situation could be pretty similar to the way that two strangers would share a house, in terms of sleeping apart, having separate rooms, and minimizing interruptions of each other. Of course, we wouldn't be just like strangers because we would also meet up to talk regularly, maybe do some chores together, and share physical intimacy.\nIt's probably not feasible for now, but in the long run I could imagine even living in little separate houses next door to one another rather than in the same house, in order to reduce disturbing one another and make a clear separation between our respective spaces. This arrangement would minimize the disagreements and annoyances that living together could cause while allowing for closer contact than is possible with a long-distance relationship. Ideally these two mini houses could be connected by an indoor hallway so that we wouldn't have to go outdoors in order to visit each other.\nI would prefer a relationship in which we work on our own separate projects almost all the time and don't judge each other for how we spend our time. I would enjoy talking about what we're doing but without any expectations for the other person. For this reason, I don't have strong preferences about whether the other person would have a job or not, would be \"ambitious\" or not, etc.\nI would prefer for my partner to be reasonably independent and not need my help too often, though I would be happy to occasionally assist with physical tasks, questions, emotional troubles, and so on. Likewise, I also would be pretty independent.\nMy costs of living are fairly low. Most of my expenses are on essentials like food and health insurance. If my partner wanted financial support from me, I would prefer if she were also fairly frugal, although spending on the order of $1000 to $2000 per year on \"luxuries\" would be ok. If my partner earned her own income and spent that money on a more lavish lifestyle, that may also be ok, although I'm more likely to get along with people who have an altruistic mindset and want to donate significant portions of their income to charity.\nValues\nMy main altruistic focus in life is seeking to reduce suffering, especially the suffering of non-human animals and possible digital creatures that may be created in the future. In philosophical jargon, I'm roughly a\nnegative utilitarian\n, which means I think suffering is vastly more morally significant than happiness or other valuable things. Unbearable torture cannot be \"morally offset\" by also bringing enough pleasure into the world. This stance leads to a kind of\nantinatalism\n, because often the easiest way to prevent unbearable suffering is for a being never to be born in the first place. For example, there's an extraordinary amount of animal (especially invertebrate) suffering occurring in nature, due to predation, disease, starvation, and so on. One way to reduce this suffering is to reduce the amount of nature that exists. For instance, we could cover lawns with gravel to prevent grass growth, and with less grass to eat, there would be fewer animals. (In the long run, I would like to have a gravel, no-grass lawn at my house. It should also reduce the risk of ticks.)\nPolitically my values lean toward progressive, but I think there are many real-world complexities that make any dogmatic stances unwise. For example, increasing the minimum wage seems noble but could also increase unemployment and force some companies out of business (though it may still be a good policy on balance). Also, my negative-utilitarian philosophy is sometimes at odds with progressive policies, such as when I favor reducing rather than increasing the amount of wilderness that exists. On issues like feminism, I'm somewhere in between the vociferous voices on either side of the debates. Despite agreeing with social-justice advocates on many policy stances, I can be turned off by the more aggressive forms of social-justice activism because I prefer more respectful and nuanced discussion of these difficult issues.\nI'm an atheist, although I find it reasonably likely that we (or at least some copies of us) live in a computer simulation of some kind.\nIn terms of interpersonal relationships, I think trust is fundamental. Knowing that the other person won't do something harmful behind your back is very important. A relationship should be a place where you feel completely comfortable in the other person's presence and can tell him/her anything, as long as it's done in a respectful way. For example, if one person were inclined to cheat on his/her partner, I would favor discussing these feelings openly and seeing what could be done about the situation. If one person feels dissatisfied about some aspect of the relationship, it's generally better to discuss the problem and work toward solutions rather than letting the negative feelings fester. (That said, if unhappy feelings are trivial or transitory, sometimes it makes sense to keep them to yourself and let them fade on their own rather than troubling the other person about them.)\nOther compatibility topics\nI intend to remain childfree indefinitely, because raising kids takes an enormous amount of time that I would rather spend on my current activities. I have a vasectomy, which combined with possibly other forms of birth control such as condoms and the rhythm method would preclude pregnancies. I would also want to avoid adopting kids. I dislike pets for a similar reason: they take time and resources, they can get into trouble around the house, and I don't get much enjoyment from being around them. Plus, I don't want to buy pet food containing animal products, which gives some revenue to the factory-farming industry. My childfree requirement is an absolute dealbreaker, while my anti-pet stance is merely a strong preference. If there were an otherwise amazing match who really wanted a cat or dog, I could probably learn to live with that.\nI'm a lacto-vegetarian, meaning I'm vegan except that I eat dairy products (mostly cheese and ice cream). I'd be happy with a partner who was vegan or lacto-vegetarian. I also don't mind someone who eats beef on a regular basis because the harm caused to farmed animals per calorie of food is much smaller than for other forms of meat and because in some cases I think cattle farming may reduce wild-animal suffering. I would probably feel dismayed to see a partner eat any smaller animals than cows on a regular basis. (Maybe lamb would be ok too.) Eating a serving of fish or other non-cow animals once or twice per year as a health precaution would probably be ok, and eating meat leftovers from a social event that would otherwise go to waste is of course fine.\nI would also prefer if my partner didn't consume much honey or\nrice\n, for animal-suffering reasons, although this is less important than not eating chicken/fish/eggs, and if I can be convinced that rice harvesting is no more violent than, e.g., wheat harvesting, I'd be fine with it.\nI prefer to avoid non-trivially illegal activities, including illegal drugs. I also wouldn't want secondhand smoke in the house. My main concerns with drugs like alcohol would be whether they impair one's judgment or cause one's personality to become more annoying. Personally I don't do any drugs (besides medical/nutritional ones) and never consume alcohol. I even avoid caffeine, but I wouldn't care if a partner consumed it.\nI'm looking for a long-term relationship, one in which I could be best friends with my partner for an indefinite period of time. Such a relationship could potentially last for life, but I also recognize that statistically, even many marriages don't last, and maybe this is a good thing, because people can change a lot over time.\nIf we lived together, I would imagine splitting housework in the same way that strangers sharing a house would: we would generally each take care of our own side of it. We could each clean our own rooms, prepare our own meals, do our own laundry, etc. If one person wanted to do some of these things for the other person, that would be fine (although I personally would still want to clean my own rooms and prepare most of my own food). Some activities like grocery shopping and taking trash to the transfer station would make more sense for a single person to do for both of us (or we could hire a third party to do these tasks).\nI would favor dividing the house between us as much as possible and letting each person do whatever s/he wants with his/her half of the house (except in the case of externalities like noise, secondhand smoke, jeopardizing the security of our home computer network, etc). Our possessions would likewise be mostly our own rather than shared. Dividing things up in this way would reduce the frequency of disagreements about how something should be done, because there would be fewer things to disagree about. Some rooms (like the kitchen) and possessions (like the washing machine) would have to be shared, and in that case, we would decide together what changes to make to them.\nI think entertainment/music/etc tastes are pretty irrelevant for romantic compatibility. For whatever it's worth, the movies/shows/channels on Netflix and YouTube that I watch are mostly comedies, because I usually want to relax rather than to process something emotionally heavy, though I enjoy other genres too on occasion. Even if I lived with someone else, I would prefer to watch TV on my own while exercising, because I only want to watch something when I'm specifically in the mood for it rather than at a scheduled time, and I often take breaks. For example, if I'm lifting dumbbells, I may need to take a bathroom break to wash my hands if they've become greasy, which worsens my grip. I would prefer for a partner to always use earbuds/headphones while watching TV or listening to music to avoid creating noise, and I do the same.\nAppearance\nI think I generally look ok, but there are some parts of my appearance that may not be very pleasant:\nI have a lot of acne on my upper chest and back.\nWhen I don't shower often enough, I develop flaky skin on my face and scalp due to seborrhoeic dermatitis. After I wash my face with Head & Shoulders shampoo, the areas where skin was peeled off can appear red.\nI'm somewhat overweight, with most of the excess fat concentrated in my belly. I'm 69.5 inches tall with a weight around 183 pounds, making my BMI in the range 26 to 27.\nI shave all the hair on my body fairly short, to roughly half a centimeter in length. Having less hair just feels less messy, and it makes checking my body for ticks easier. I fully shave my facial hair about once a week and let it grown in between those shavings.\nFollowing are some fairly typical photos of me, taken in summer 2020.\nIn the last of these photos you can most clearly see some dermatitis buildup on my face.\nFor better or worse, the physical features that I find attractive in women are roughly society's conventional beauty standards, perhaps because that's what I grew up seeing on TV and in magazines in my childhood during the 1990s. I think attractiveness affects male motivation for a relationship at a deep \"lizard brain\" level, so it does matter to some degree, but I also prefer if a partner doesn't feel pressure to change her appearance on account of me, because that can be unpleasant.\nThe main reason attractiveness matters is not for sex; I don't care\nthat\nmuch about sex per se. The more significant reason is that attractiveness plays some role in the amount of \"warm fuzzies\" that I feel and how much I enjoy talking with the person, and for me, those are the main reasons to have a romantic relationship. I have relatively little relationship experience, so maybe this view of mine is naive or would change with time.\nIn general, my (possibly naive) ranked list of motivations for a relationship in descending order of importance is\nThe feeling of warm fuzzies when spending time together (talking, doing chores together, etc). These fuzzies are also somewhat present when we're apart and doing our own stuff.\nCompanionship, friendship, emotional support, mental intimacy.\nPhysical intimacy (hugging, cuddling, sexual activity).\nHelping each other out with chores/etc.\nThe last of these two mainly only apply to an in-person relationship rather than a long-distance one, but they're less important to me than the first two.\nUpdate from 2022: I hope readers don't conclude from the above discussion that they have to be reasonably attractive in order to contact me. I care less about attractiveness than the average man, even if I may be more honest about its role than most men are. Since originally writing the above section in 2020, I've found that the amount I care about attractiveness has decreased even further over time. Traits like warmth, emotional stability, intelligence, caring about animal welfare and reducing suffering, and being able to get tasks done in a dependable way on one's own are all probably at least as important to me as physical attractiveness—except if a potential partner is unusually unattractive. Roughly, I think as long as a potential partner is above the ~25th percentile of attractiveness for her age, then I could probably learn to live with that, especially if she would be open to sometimes using porn together during sexual activity for extra eye candy, which I expect could go a long way toward reducing how much I care about her own appearance.\nWhen I was a kid, I was often told that \"beauty is only skin deep\" and \"what really matters is on the inside\" when choosing a romantic partner. I generally assumed that was the case, but over time I began hearing more people express a contrary opinion that no, actually, physical attractiveness plays a big role in relationship satisfaction. I assumed that maybe those people were right and that maybe the messages about how beauty doesn't matter too much were sort of benign propaganda. However, as I've continued dating and introspecting on what matters to me, I'm beginning to think that maybe the people who said appearances aren't that important were mostly right? I still don't have a lot of experience, so maybe I'll change my mind yet again. If porn and masturbation didn't exist or were prohibited by my religion, then I could imagine that the attractiveness of my partner might be fairly important, because I would only be able to have sexual experiences with that one person. But given that porn and masturbation do exist, maybe those already provide a reasonable substitute for an attractive partner, especially if those experiences can be shared with my partner.\nIn my opinion, looking extremely attractive is like training for the Olympics. It's cool that some people work hard at it so that the rest of us can appreciate the fruits of their labor. But most people don't need to be training for the Olympics nor going to great lengths to be beautiful. Of course, even if we don't need to be Olympic athletes, a little bit of exercise is still good, and likewise, very low-effort ways to improve one's appearance are also welcome.\nPersonality\nI'm introverted but also enjoy talking with people when I'm in the mood. If I get along well with someone, I like having long, deep, and intimate discussions. Some of my conversations with friends have gone for 6 or 7 hours. I'm fairly empathetic and usually care about others' emotions. I sometimes try to be funny and tell \"dad jokes\" (though I never want to be an actual dad). I also enjoy self-deprecating humor, though I'm not always joking when I describe my shortcomings. :)\nI'm usually in a pretty good mood and have a positive attitude, despite my \"pessimistic\" negative-utilitarian and antinatalist philosophies. The reason I hold a suffering-focused ethical view is not because I'm unhappy; I think life is sorta fun much of the time. Rather, my reason is that some experiences of intense suffering are so awful and morally salient that everything else seems trivial by comparison.\nI'm attracted to women who are warm, supportive, considerate, funny, and (once we know each other enough) flirty. I try to have all those attributes as well, though I may not necessarily succeed.\nI try to be non-judgmental, though I may disagree with another person's views on something. In cases of conflict, I prefer discussing the problem, seeking to resolve it, and trying to avoid holding grudges. I like this quote: \"Holding a grudge is like holding a hot iron—it hurts you.\"\nI think I get angry less often than average, and when I do have that emotion, I usually express my feelings using words rather than shouting or making insults. I would hope for the same from a partner. I would not be able to live with someone who had a hot temper too often.\nAs problems arise in a relationship, I prefer to hear about them and brainstorm solutions together. Some polite disagreements and concerns from time to time in a generally happy relationship are normal and manageable. However, if non-trivial issues keep arising on a regular basis, I may prefer to give up rather than continue trying to fix them, given that I like being single and don't need a relationship. If a relationship is causing significant distress more often than, say, once every few months in the long run, it seems like more trouble than it's worth. Therefore, I wouldn't be able to provide the level of certainty or commitment that some people might want in a relationship. That said, if the relationship seemed otherwise extremely promising, I'd likely continue trying for a few months or maybe even 1-2 years before throwing in the towel.\nI enjoy exchanging sweet sentiments with a romantic partner, but I'm not interested in the formal romantic holidays like our anniversary, Valentine's Day, birthdays, etc. In general, I don't celebrate holidays. I prefer to do nice things together when the mood arises rather than on a schedule. I also am not very excited by gifts unless the person actually needs the item that would be purchased, and even in that case, instead of receiving a gift I would rather buy the item myself to make sure I'm getting exactly the kind I want. I could pick out the exact item I want on Amazon and send its URL to the other person, but that seems like unnecessary overhead relative to just buying it myself. Instead of gifts, I prefer to show affection by occasionally writing nice messages, making videos, helping with chores, providing reassurance, and so on.\nI dislike surprises (surprise parties, surprise gifts, etc) because I want to plan ahead for things and discuss together whether a proposal makes sense. In general, I prefer life to be calm and predictable rather than \"exciting\". Excitement can come from entertainment rather than real life.\nBeing sugar-hungry and sugar-full\nI find that romantic interaction, such as talking with a girlfriend, feels like eating sugar: it's sweet, pleasant, and somewhat addictive. There are times when I really want sugar, and times when I feel full of it. The same is true for interaction with a girlfriend. I use the word \"sugar-hungry\" to describe those times when I crave romantic interaction and the word \"sugar-full\" to describe times when I'm satiated and don't want more romantic interaction. (I used to name these emotional states based on a specific kind of sugary food, like cake, but I don't want to subconsciously encourage people to eat non-vegan cake because the eggs it contains caused enormous suffering to factory-farmed hens.)\nWhat happens if my and my girlfriend's sugar levels are different at a given time? If one person is hungry to spend time together while the other would rather get work done, what do you do? In my opinion, work is much more important than romantic interaction, since romance is just a fun bonus in life, while altruistic efforts are what really matter. So I think the default should be that if one person wants romantic interaction while the other doesn't, no interaction takes place. Both people should \"swipe right\" (in Tinder lingo) on a given interaction at a given time before it occurs. An exception would be if one person is feeling significantly bad and needs to talk about something right away.\nAn unfortunate aspect of my personality for relationship compatibility is that I tend to get very interested in something for a while and then lose that interest for a while, until getting interested again. In the case of romantic sugar, I sometimes want to binge on it for a while and then fast for several days afterward. This could be pretty annoying to someone who prefers more moderate serving sizes every day. That said, it's plausible that if the other person prevented my sugar binges, then my periods of fasting would also be shorter.\nThe addictiveness of romance can also be a problem if it's tempting and distracts from focus on other things. For this reason, I think I would prefer long periods of talking on an infrequent basis (like once a week), so that during the rest of the time I could get absorbed in my work and non-romance forms of leisure, rather than being distracted by thinking about the next romantic interaction or checking the other person's availability. Unfortunately, because of my erratic waking hours, I wouldn't be able to schedule a fixed time slot for interaction each week. Also, I might randomly be sugar-full or otherwise absorbed into something else when the scheduled interaction would have occurred, which would be unpleasant. Interrupting the flow of meaningful work just to enjoy some fun sugar instead is something I would want to avoid as much as possible.\nSo there are some challenges here, and maybe I find these things more difficult than most people do. But I imagine that enough brainstorming, experimentation, and patience could produce a system for managing different sugar levels that works well enough, as long as the other person also roughly shares my introversion and belief that work is more important than romance.\nAlso, it's plausible that this problem would lessen in the long run once my girlfriend and I got more used to each other, because the tastiness of our sugar might decline. There are several things (foods, TV shows, intellectual topics, etc) that I used to find terribly addictive but now don't because I just got more accustomed to them.\nMonogamy vs polyamory\nWhen I first wrote this dating profile in 2020, one of my criteria for a relationship said: \"monogamous but allowing for viewing/reading porn\". In the following two years, half a dozen people asked me about the reasoning behind my preference for monogamy, with some people suggesting that polyamory could work better given that I don't want to spend a lot of time with my partner. In 2022, I finally updated this profile to say that I would consider either monogamy or polyamory depending on the situation. This section elaborates on my thinking. That said, I know little about the theory of polyamory or what it looks like in practice, so some of what I say may be mistaken.\nHere are my reasons for preferring to have only one partner for myself:\nTime\n: I'm extremely introverted and don't want to spend much time with a partner. One partner is already a big time commitment for me. Having two partners who both expected a nontrivial amount of interaction would be a nightmare.\nLove\n: When I'm in love with someone, the thought of another partner is unappealing. It seems like eating another meal when I'm already full from the first meal.\nJealousy\n: If my partner wanted me to be monogamous, I wouldn't want to make her jealous or hurt by having another partner.\nAnd here are my reasons for wanting my partner to be monogamous:\nSTIs\n: If she was physically intimate with other people (IRL, not just online), then I would worry about STI spreading, and guarding against that would be a big hassle. Of course, if I myself wasn't physically intimate with her IRL, this wouldn't matter.\nLove\n: If I were in love with my partner, I would worry about losing her. If she were romantic with other people, maybe she would become more attached to them over time and want to leave me.\nJealousy\n: I would worry that some of her other partners might not be ok with her being polyamorous. Maybe the time she spent with me would make them unhappy, even if they claimed to be fine with it.\nSince these are currently my main hesitations about polyamory, in cases where they wouldn't apply, I would be open to trying polyamory.\nPolyamory for myself\nI would consider two partners for myself in a situation where the time spent with each person wouldn't exceed 1-2 hours per week on average, where I wasn't deeply in love with any person enough to not want another partner, and where neither partner would be made jealous.\nIf I lived with a partner in person, I plausibly wouldn't have time for any other partner because living together requires a decent amount of in-person interaction, and plausibly my introvert brain would already feel enough social stimulation from that to not want more. Also, because of STI concerns, I plausibly wouldn't want to do IRL sexual activity with anyone except a primary partner who herself was monogamous. However, online sexual interaction with other people wouldn't be ruled out.\n(Another argument against IRL sex in a long-distance relationship is that traveling would squish bugs and harm animals in other ways, and I'd feel guilty about causing that harm without a good reason.)\nA main possible advantage of polyamory would be that I might be less bothered by the incompatibilities of any given partner. If I have to choose just one partner, there's a lot of pressure to make the perfect choice, but no partner is ever perfect.\nOne situation where people often use polyamory is if a main partner has low sex drive. This main partner (often a woman) might encourage her boyfriend/husband to get sex elsewhere. I'm unsure if I would be happy with an arrangement of that sort, because for me, a main point of sexual interaction is to feel intimate with someone I love and to increase romantic attraction. If I just wanted an orgasm, I could masturbate on my own. In evolutionary terms, it doesn't make sense for a man to have romantic feelings toward a woman whom he never has sex with, because she won't bear his children, so at best she would be one more friend. I suppose there are some exceptions to this evolutionary claim, such as if a woman could help the man raise kids from a previous relationship. Also, the predictions of armchair evolutionary psychology aren't necessarily true in the real world, though I think it is true that many men require an expectation of eventually having some amount of sexual activity in order to feel significant romantic interest in someone. In any case, there are many couples where having sex outside the relationship makes things work for them, which is great.\nPolyamory for my partner\nI would be open to a polyamourous partner if STIs weren't a concern, if I wasn't so in love with her that I worried about losing her, and if all of her other partners were genuinely ok with her being polyamourous rather than just grudgingly accepting of it.\nSTIs would not be a concern either if I was never physically intimate IRL with her, or if she wasn't physically intimate with anyone besides me IRL. In theory if there was a third person who was also STI-paranoid, it might work for her to have two IRL partners, but I would worry about making things complicated, and we would have to deeply trust the honesty of everyone involved. In any case, I don't live near enough like-minded people for it to be likely that there would even be multiple IRL partners.\nThe possibility of jealousy felt by her other partners is a main hesitation of mine, since I would feel guilty unless everyone involved was enthusiastically consenting to the arrangement. That said, I imagine there are some people who are enthusiastic enough about polyamory to allay this worry.\nThe main benefit of having a polyamorous partner would be that I wouldn't be the only person responsible for her romantic needs, and I could spend less time on the relationship than most monogamous women would prefer.\nAcknowledgements\nParts of this page were inspired by discussions about compatibility with a girlfriend during summer 2020.
