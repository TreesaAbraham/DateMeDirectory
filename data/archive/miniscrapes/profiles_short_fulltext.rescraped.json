      "fullText": "﻿Tony’s Date-me Doc\r\n(Last updated: 15 Nov 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\nN MY UNDERGRADUATE YEARS, I was very focused on my studies.  So when my parents found out after graduation that I had departed from my studies and become interested in solving the world’s problems, they were surprised and worried that I wouldn’t be able to find a proper job.  They asked “why don’t you become a politician?  We can support your further studies.”  I responded that while it is an option, there is one vocation with a greater potential to do good, and that is the philosopher.  I hope that by perpetually learning, understanding perspectives, and experiencing all that the world has to offer, I can philosophise with enough acuity to help guide humanity through these turbulent times and contribute to our roadmap for the future.    \r\nAbout me  \r\n* I am a 25-year-old 175cm-tall man.\r\n* I work as an online tutor, an occupation bestowed upon me by my wanderlust.  Even though I currently live in Melbourne, I could be anywhere, anytime.\r\n* I am agnostic and liberal-leaning.  I don’t drink or smoke.  I neither have nor want children.\r\nCore values\r\nI am a positive, lively, and happy person.  Life is inherently beautiful, and the world is my playground.  I think most people who meet me would say I have a fun, bubbly character.  I loathe to offend others, though I feel disingenuous telling white lies, so I have become quite adept at telling “white truths”.\r\nI am extremely curious.  One of my long-term goals is to “climb the mountain of knowledge”.  This knowledge includes reading undergraduate textbooks on every major university discipline, but equally includes picking up skills and experiences, travelling the natural and cultural world, and so on.  A Chinese proverb tells me “read ten thousand books and journey ten thousand miles”.  Of course, I realise that life is too short to accomplish this goal, but the process matters more to me than the destination.  Besides, the mountain of knowledge has no summit!\r\nI am independent and free-spirited.  I don’t like relying on others, and rarely ask others for favours.  Despite being a bit of a people-pleaser, I am highly resistant to peer-pressure, and do not mind being perceived as quirky.  In thought, I am naturally skeptical and like to come to my own conclusions.\r\nI have many ideas and perspectives.  I love exploring the intangible world through conversation, whether that leans objective (such as STEM, history, society, politics, ...) or subjective (such as life, relationships, experiences, identity, ...).  If I think an opinion is one-sided, I feel an urge to defend other perspectives, as “a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence”.  Because of this, I can play a mighty devil’s advocate, though I realise it is seldom called for.\r\nI am highly greed-avoidant.  I believe that it is possible to live a happy and fulfilling life on a modest amount of money, so I am suspicious of rich people who earn more than they can ever spend.  I would rather do meaningful work voluntarily (and I do) than be paid well to do a bullshit job.  The rich and the poor are both preoccupied with money at the expense of happiness, so I intend to be neither.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tony will no doubt be one of the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. [...] Tony is also incredibly warm and brings a very positive energy to any group activity.”\r\n      — Alan, friend of two years\r\nAbout you\r\nIt is difficult to qualify what one finds attractive.  For me, sharing core values is a good start.  In terms of character, I generally find myself attracted to quieter people who feel deeply, care unabashedly, and whose smile and laughter bring joy to the world.  Having agency and a strong work ethic is also a big plus.  Many of the qualities I am attracted to are shared by affectionate cats, and I confess I absolutely adore cats and it seems they generally like me back!\r\nAbout us\r\nI believe that the happiest relationships are those where the partners are already happy coming into the relationship.  The most uplifting relationships are those where each partner’s strengths inspire the other to grow.  The most loving relationships are those built upon a deep friendship and a genuine respect for each other.  \r\nI’m looking for love that makes life worth living all over again.\r\nIt is said that Zeus knew humans would be too powerful if we weren’t split at birth and condemned to search for our other half.  But really, he just meant us.  We’d be the power couple who saves the world.  Maybe we’ve finally found each other, much to Zeus’ chagrin?  If you think this might be the case, please dispatch a messenger to deliver your message to the following address at once.  We can then conduct a low-stakes holographic encounter through the aether  :)\r\nTW2000X@GMAIL.COM\r\n  More photos of me and my travels",

My father had lived most of his adult life in the US and wanted to get his MBA at USC. I attended Carlthorp School then Marlborough School, and undergrad at Williams College in western Massachusetts to become a contemporary art curator. Along the way I heavily pursued Buddhist psychology living at various Zen temples and Buddhist retreat centers. While learning German in Berlin, I discovered activist art and changed my major to Studio art when I returned to school. I won a travel scholar grant to study activist art in Korea and eventually focused on durational performance art and social practice. After college I lived at an intentional community for contact improvisation called Earthdance Creative Living Project where I studied Body-Mind Centering, Authentic Movement, and a host of other embodied anatomy movement practices. I returned to Los Angeles to study Continuum Movement with Emilie Conrad until she passed away in 2014. I decided to dedicate my career to combining somatics with medicine and completed post baccalaureate pre medical training at UCLA Extension while studying craniosacral therapy. That led me to the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland Oregon where I reside to this day. \r\n  Community/Friendships:\r\n* Fernhill Ecstatic Dance\r\n* Thursday Night Contact Improvisation\r\n* Korean American Coalition, KAC Oregon\r\n                \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks That Have Shaped Me:\r\n   * New Self, New World by Philip Shepherd  \r\n   * The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle\r\n   * Unlimiting Mind: The Radically Experiential Psychology of Buddhism by Andrew Olendzki \r\nValues:\r\n   * Universal love\r\n   * Sovereignty\r\n   * Curiosity and open mindedness \r\n   * Taking initiative \r\n   * Integrity\r\n   * Growth mindset \r\n   * Kindness\r\n   * Generosity\r\n   * Empathy\r\n   * Optimism\r\n   * Nonjudgement\r\n   * Unattachment\r\n   * Creativity\r\n   * “Seek first to understand”\r\nWhat others have said:\r\n   * Words about me\r\n   * “You have one of the most vital energies of someone I have felt” - Akash Gama\r\n   * “I have smelled a lot of people, but you have the rolls royce of smells” - Dean Evans \r\n   * “5/5 stars, would date again” “You have great genes, you should definitely procreate” - Phil Illy \r\n   * “Your voice is so soothing, I could listen to you all day.” Thom LaFond\r\nRelationship\r\nGeneral compatibility stuff:\r\n   * Gender/Orientation:\r\n   * Pansexual female \r\n   * Religion:\r\n   * Raised Protestant, currently none \r\n   * Recreational substances\r\n   * Non smoker (no tobacco or cannabis), seldom drinker (wine tasting yes)\r\n   * Entheogens \r\n   * Soon-to-be licensed psilocybin facilitator \r\n   * Politics\r\n   * Apolitical, issue-based bipartisan \r\n   * Lifestyle\r\n   * Diet: whole foods, home cooking, occasional processed foods\r\n   * Environmental: scent-free, avoid microplastic and petroleum based products \r\n   * Fitness\r\n   * Yoga, running, outdoor sports\r\nRelationship Intentions and preparation: \r\n   * Do you know how to regulate your nervous system after getting triggered?\r\n   * Do you know what unresolved relational patterns or attachment wounds you could potentially be bringing into the relationship? \r\n   * What are your relationship boundaries/needs/requests/demands - do you know the difference between each, and do you know how to clearly communicate them? \r\n   * Do you know what your heart needs to feel safe and connected? \r\n   * Are you able to fully accept and enjoy love without suspicion, doubt, or the constant anxiety that something bad is inevitably going to happen? \r\n   * Do you know the difference between your inner child's needs and your adult self's needs in a relationship? \r\n   * Do you have clarity around what you actually want from a relationship? \r\n   * Have you been emotionally available to yourself in these ways? \r\n   * Are you emotionally available to the love you're seeking? \r\nI like people who:\r\n   * Eat vegetables and whole foods, generally avoid processed food \r\n   * Have a relationship with nature and the earth\r\n   * Meditate regularly or have attended meditation retreats\r\n   * Have participated in counseling, therapy or are familiar with self-reflection\r\n   * Practice embodiment and feel comfortable in their own skin\r\n   * Have a growth mindset and have experience with improving behaviors\r\n   * Are free of substance use or addiction\r\n   * Have experienced oneness and mind-expansive states through fasting, plant medicine, meditation, chanting, or prayer\r\n   * Have earned-secure or secure attachment\r\n   * Want to live a long healthy life and take care of their body\r\n   * Have deep relationships with people in their community \r\n   * Express positive regard with current and past relationships \r\n   * Have emotional and financial stability\r\n   * Are supportive of me fostering close friendships which include platonic affection\r\nHow I resolve conflict: \r\n   * With Nonviolent communication or thoughtful language\r\n   * If escalated conflict, ask a third party for mediation\r\nThings you should know about me in relationships:\r\nLifestyle\r\nTypical week night\r\nTypical weekend \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get in touch: \r\nFeel free to email me or add me on Facebook/ping me on Messenger about what resonated, what you’re working on, thinking about, or learning lately!",

      "fullText": "﻿Date Charlie  \r\nHey, thanks for stopping by! I’m Charlie, and I’m looking for a deep connection with a man, hopefully in the Bay Area, with an eye to finding my life partner. If you’re interested, please reach out! You can message me, get a mutual friend to intro us, email me, or use this link. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nI come across as perceptive, caring, attuned, ambitious, and sincere. \r\nHere’s how some of my friends describe me:\r\nSasha Chapin: “I think of Charlie as a graceful mover, both in physical space and in conversational space — he is a striking presence that improves the energy of a room.”\r\nCatherio: “Perceptive, caring, attuned.”\r\nMax Heitmann (ex-bf): “Charlie is his own person, probably the most himself of anyone I know. That person is sincere, curious, determined, and loving.”\r\nNora Ammann: “Charlie is thoughtful, caring and attuned, as well as spirited, curious and courageous. He is a good and loyal friend.”\r\nJohn Salvatier: “Unrelentingly present.”\r\n  \r\n\r\nRelationship style\r\nI lean monogamous, though I have a few years of experience with poly / open relationships, which I’m open to exploring with the right person. I think I’ll want children in the future, but likely not within the next 5 years.\r\nInterests\r\nI spend a significant part of my life on self-discovery, introspecting, and deepening my relationships with others. I did some Serious Meditation a few years back, and had some profound experiences. I now spend a good chunk of my time on relational practices—which often looks like having very present, authentic, conversations. Relational practices bring more truth and love to my relationships and my self-expression, and nourish me massively. \r\n  \r\n\r\nI like running events! I host dance parties and run regular relational practices; I’ve run a Relateful (circling) immersion with Jordan Allen, a Coherence Psychology retreat with Malcolm Ocean, and many CFAR and CFAR-adjacent workshops. \r\nBesides that, I love to dance west coast swing (see me dancing here), lift heavy things with perfect form (see me lifting here), hang out with my friends’ kids, and cry at Jacob Collier videos.\r\nCareer stuff: I’m Chief of Staff at Palisade Research, where we’re trying to build awareness of AI risks among policymakers. Previously, I worked as an instructor for the Center For Applied Rationality. And before that, I did a master’s at Oxford, and developed Bayesian ML models to estimate the effectiveness of interventions against COVID. Tyler Cowen described my paper as ‘The best mask-wearing study so far?’.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nI’m usually more attracted to people who are more:\r\n* Emotionally attuned: You’re in touch with yourself and listen deeply to others. You care a lot about communicating authentically.\r\n* Vibrantly interested in stuff: You’re intellectually lively, sharp/analytical, and curious. \r\n* Extroverted / energetic.\r\n* Playful!\r\n* Grounded: You’re steady in yourself, and in touch with your masculine energy.\r\n* Cute / sweet.\r\nAbout us\r\nSpending time with each other nourishes us, brings us closer to ourselves, and reminds us what life is about. \r\nI’d be especially happy if our relationship had:\r\n* Deep listening. Over time, we come to know each other, and how we relate to one another, more and more deeply. \r\n* Alive, attuned, and perhaps wildly kinky, sex (I’m switch). Also, attuned touch; cuddling.\r\n* We’re entangled with what matters most to each of us. We mutually support each other’s interests, and sometimes even participate / collaborate / build together.\r\n* Fun: We go on adventures, nature or otherwise. We share music. We dance together, messy and silly, gentle and sensual. We play. We laugh lots. We cuddle up with an excellent movie or a trashy TV show.\r\nIf you’re interested, please reach out! You can message me, get a mutual friend to intro us, email me, or use this link.",

      "fullText": "﻿Please don't share publicly. \r\n\r\n\r\nHi, I’m Nadia, 29, seeking the right partner for an altruistic power couple. Get in touch with me or share with men who you think might be a good match.\r\nI work in a big consulting firm (for skill building and “earning to give”) but previously dabbled in pandemic preparedness policy, research, nonprofit work, and a biotech startup. Located in Berlin as of August 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is the most recent picture (July 2025). I need to update my photos however, I have since cut my hair to shoulder length\r\n🍦Pro\r\n* Energetic and bubbly. I laugh a lot, and I’m an easy audience if you want to test your own comedic aptitude. Examples of this:\r\n   * Exercise and humour are my favourite coping skills, so…—well, I better be strong and hilarious.\r\n   * I play improv and host improv workshops sometimes.\r\n   * I go hoarse before I run out of social energy.\r\n* Deliberate approach to life, love efficiency, agentic as fuck.\r\n   * Nothing that can’t be solved with a spreadsheet, a rubber duck, and coffee.\r\n   * I found my last longterm partner after less than 2 months of building a funnel with screening criteria and setting up 5-min video calls. I won’t be a great match for most, and want to be mindful of everyone’s time while I find the person who is. \r\n* Excitable & curious. \r\n   * I’ve been told that my questions are unique and inspiring.\r\n   * I can make surface-level boring topics like patent landscaping and ISO standards sexy.\r\n* Committed to self-improvement.\r\n   * I had a lot of coaching and have set up systems so I don’t make the same mistake twice. I like having essentialist routines and hacking my brain.\r\n   * I worked as a junior psychiatrist before. I am trained in CBT and NVC, and not afraid to use both to help us grow.\r\n* Emotionally stable & pragmatic.\r\n   * Friends appreciate how I balance succinctness and solution-focus with warmth and care.\r\n   * For years, I lived out of a suitcase and didn’t really have a home address. I also cached in dozens of rejections before finding my academic supervisor—but I’m really happy most of the time. This is to say, I’m rather tolerant of uncertainty and rejection in both my personal and professional life.\r\n⚖️ Neutral (?)\r\n* Vegetarian.\r\n   * It’s important to me that my partner is vegetarian or vegan, too.\r\n* I don’t do alcohol, cigarettes, or THC.\r\n   * I care about sharing an evidence-based, healthy lifestyle that acknowledges tradeoffs quantitatively.\r\n   * Not all drugs are created equal; I’ve found psychonauting with loved ones meaningful and connecting. \r\n* No children, by default.\r\n   * Unlikely circumstances such as ²⁴⁄₇ nanny support, a surrogate, and strong impact-related arguments could change my mind if my partner became very excited about having children.\r\n* Good dancer.\r\n   * As a pretty low priority, I would love to find someone who’s into dancing, too. But I’m too impatient to take beginner’s classes together. \r\n🦄 Con/”Niche taste”\r\n* I work a lot. \r\n   * I usually travel for work 4 days a week, and quite long hours. We’ll probably need to compromise and get creative to make space for enough quality time.\r\n* Disagreeable and very direct.\r\n   * I’m also responsive to feedback on my communication style. Still, I’m a better match for someone who enjoys mutual teasing and the occasional roast.\r\n   * I love people who sharpen my thinking—let’s be each other’s whetstones, like these two.\r\n* My sleep is sacred.\r\n   * I need to leave dates before 22:30, otherwise I turn into a pumpkin. Sometimes, I need to set timers for physical intimacy.\r\n🧩 And you?\r\nI’d like to find a partner who has been told he’s a great communicator and fundamentally cares about similar things as I do. Of course, I like all the things most people find attractive in potential mates (humour, intelligence, kindness, success, conventional physical attractiveness, etc). However, I don’t believe I—or anyone, really—can armchair checkbox-criteria for compatibility. You should err on the side of getting in touch! I won’t bite I only bite with consent!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve read until here and think we vibe, tell me why we would make a great team, and I’ll make time to chat: nadia@montazeri.co or via Facebook messenger (Nadia Xenia Montazeri). Please also share some photos or links to socials. 😊\r\n⭐ Testimonial\r\nI’m good friends with Jan, my previous partner, and I asked him for a review I could add to this document. Here’s what he wrote:\r\n“Nadia and I were in a relationship for two years, so as a Nadia connoisseur, I want to share my experience with you. Reading this document, you might feel like I felt eons ago, when I first encountered her. A bit intimidated, a bit confused, but also intrigued and excited. Being with Nadia is an acquired, yet highly rewarding taste.\r\nYou know how when you go lift weights, you should have a spotter? Someone that both has your back, but also pushes you to improve?\r\nNadia is like that, but for life. Being with her is like standing on a skyscraper-grade foundation and simultaneously jumping on a trampoline. \r\nYou're having a good day? You will not find a more bubbly, more enthusiastic, more supportive person to share it with. Nadia is thirsty for life, and she will show you how to drink your day with gusto. Her shenanigans are legendary and her laughter is more contagious than a pandemic.\r\nYou're having a bad day? She will hold you and show you that it's okay to be vulnerable, that it's okay to be human. With her, heaven is just a hug away. Nadia deeply cares about those around her, and she will always be there for you. She is a person both sharp and soft, both strong and gentle, both wise and curious. Nadia has a vast, vast soul, a one-of-a-kind soul that you will always remember.”\r\n🎨 Pictures\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Pyjama party! I’m the one with the pink toothbrush)\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(yes, I’m tiny, 1.57m)",

      "fullText": "﻿Connection Quest\r\nI’m seeking a co-adventurer. Welcome to my modern day personal ad. \r\n Visual description of image: Radio City Music Hall in New York City serves as the backdrop, with people gathered around. In the foreground, I stand wearing a jumpsuit with a stripy gold sparkly top, and black pants. I am wearing a sheer cape with flowers on it, a black purse that looks like a large bowtie, and red satin heels. My hair is short, like a pixie cut, and I have gold dangly earrings and a gold necklace. I'm smiling broadly, radiating excitement. \r\n\r\nVideo: link\r\n\r\n\r\nHello there! I'm J, venturing into this digital realm to find a kindred spirit. While most love stories spark in unexpected places, why not create a chance for serendipity here?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the tune of \"If You Like Pina Coladas”:\r\n♫ If you like green smoothies, or getting lost in a board game\r\nIf you're not into smoking, if you don’t think masks are lame\r\nIf you like making goals and dancing, or doing wind sports at the Cape\r\nI might be the one you've looked for, let's go on a fun date ♫\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me: \r\nEntrepreneur, author, angel investor. Into mindfulness, outdoor adventures, reading, writing, songwriting, hiking with my friendly rescue dog, wind sports (wingfoiling and sailing), altruism, musicals, comedy, summer camp for adults, jazz, board games, dancing (salsa dancing, bachata, hustle), skiing, healthy living, offline time & personal growth. Core values: growth, impact, connection, integrity, fun. Looking for something serious. \r\nBasics: 35, she/they, 5\"5, Toronto-based, pan, monogamous, no kids, open to kids/adoption, vaccinated, have a dog, drink sometimes, non-smoker, don't do drugs, spiritual, active, ENTP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether We Could: Dance, meditate, go on outdoor adventures, hike, cook, learn and grow, make a positive impact, play board games, listen to jazz, travel, be silly and have fun. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For In A Partner:\r\nShared core values, a co-adventurer, making a positive impact, kind, emotionally and financially stable. Would love to learn and grow together, be there for each other, be playful, have fun, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntrigued? \r\nIf this resonates, don't be a stranger! If you think we’d connect (whether romantically or as friends), I’d love to hear from you - I created a way for us to get to know each other here bit.ly/connection-quest - or write to me at mightbeyourmatch@gmail.com - so we don’t have to rely on chance or algorithms. Share what makes us similar or wonderfully different. A snapshot of you would be the cherry on top. \r\n\r\n\r\nOr, if cupid points elsewhere, share this with someone you feel I might connect with. If you connect me with someone I end up becoming life partners with, I’d happily give you $1K.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the adventure begin!\r\n Visual description of image: A sunny cloudy sky serves as the backdrop, with the back of a sailboat visible. In the foreground, I sit steering the boat, wearing a silver jacket, light jeans, a black lifejacket, and aviator sunglasses. My hair is short, like a pixie cut, and a dog in a lifejacket can partially be seen beside me. I'm smiling broadly, radiating excitement. \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBuilt with ♥ & Google Docs",

Yup, I love the stars, but don't worry, I won't bore you with space facts unless you're really into that. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few things about me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I'm Latino, and stand at about 1.73 meters ( 5'8\").\r\n* I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs. I've got no issues if you like a drink now and then, though.\r\n* I'm mostly a pescatarian, but I also enjoy eating chicken occasionally; I cut out red meat a long time ago.\r\n* I’m looking for a genuine, monogamous connection with a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m into:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I care about social and climate justice, and I’m especially passionate about helping students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.\r\n* Environmentally conscious: I do not own a car, so I always bike to places. I try to conserve water and electricity, and I've taken a recent liking to train travels.\r\n* Outdoors is my jam: hiking, kayaking, zip-lining—you name it!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Swimming—it's my go-to relaxation.\r\n* Playing the guitar.\r\n* Cooking and experimenting with recipes.\r\n* Hiking and exploring trails.\r\n* Always up to try different cuisines!\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate in a partner:\r\nI value intelligence, kindness, and someone supportive. Not looking for academic accolades, just someone who's passionate about their work, has a good laugh, and genuinely enjoys helping others and making a positive impact on the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust so you know:\r\nIf we hit it off and decide to meet, maybe we could have a fun story for how we met? Something other than \"online\" — like meeting at a crowded library while reaching for the same book on quantum mechanics. But hey, that's just a thought!\r\nFeel free to shoot me an email at elihumunguia7@gmail.com",
