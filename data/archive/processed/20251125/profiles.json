      "fullText": "That’s right, I said marry. I’m not looking to date around and figure out what’s right for me at the ripe age of 40. I know what I like and what hasn’t worked in the past (although of course I’m always open to being surprised). I’m looking for a man in the same (settling down) life stage who is ready to act decisively and live bigly ( yes of course I know that’s not a real word ).\n\nWhat works for/is attractive to me is likely not what works for/is attractive to most other people. That’s ok; I’m trying to matchmake myself—not play World Yenta™ over here. I am fully (and often painfully) aware that I am an unusual beast and it only makes sense that a reasonable match for me is another unusual beast, and we are hard to find because we’re probably sitting at home alone, thinking about how best to find each other. What a sexless mess.\n\nA short about me:\n\nPersonality/Temperament • Enneagram 8 - The Challenger > seeking similar brute force • Explorer-Director (Helen Fisher) > seeking similar • Otrovert (just learned about this one; explains a lot) > seeking similar • Things I learned from a matchmaker about myself: - High in dominance and make decisions easily - Fully differentiated from my family and do not require their input/approval for decision making - Do not require social approval (see otrovert, lol) > seeking same I hold a lot of opposites (strong, disciplined, organized and love systems but also extremely playful, irreverent, curious, creative, nurturing) and am looking for a partner who has a similar amount of range and flexibility, plus pulls equal weight in the ferocity and leadership departments. I am a physical person and am seeking a similarly physical and vital partner. I do not tend to get along with men who live in their minds or who have a low tolerance for risk. I am here to live a big life and would love the privilege of doing that with a well-matched partner.\n\n(My and hopefully your) Values • Honesty/directness/irreverence • Humor/fun/putting yourself out there/social and professional risk • Health consciousness (action-based, weight training) without neuroses (perfectionism, body obsession) • Connection to nature and animals • Physicality and connection to your body, vitality • Moderation in all things • Curiosity/exploration/growth/self improvement & learning/ self awareness/accountability • Money as freedom—not status > similar values desired in a partner\n\n(My) Hobbies • Gardening (flower, vegetable, perennial) and composting • Barton Springs • The gym (weight training) • Writing • Being outside (walking, hiking, sitting outside, soccer, frisbee, snowboarding, etc.) • Laughing about the insanity of life • Hosting/gathering people together > some overlap desired in a partner Qualities I am seeking in a man (I definitely stole 5 of these from a book or podcast but can’t remember which so can’t credit) • Character (sparkling) • Kindness (innate and unprompted) • Communication (skillful) • Consistency (self explanatory) • Commitment (marriage, kids) • Confidence (quiet) • Courage (ample) • Processing speed (fast) • Strength and physicality (yes)\n\nQualities that chafe me in men • Doesn’t understand/share my sense of humor (which is dry, smart, often filthy) • Overly cerebral/nerdy/specialistic • Controlling, either subtly or overtly, and/or uptight • Low risk tolerance, makes decisions from a fear/safety perspective, lacks urgency about living life, not action-oriented • Low self confidence • Indirect communicator • Extrinsically motivated • Mood disorders (particularly depressive, unstable temperament, low vitality) • Emotionally unregulated and/or immature • Religious (I am very secular, in case that’s not 1000% obvious) That’s all you need to know. I don’t need this thing to drag on—I’m confident you’ll know from the above if there’s a possible match or if I’ll make the man you were thinking of referring want to cry and run away (not ideal). I haven’t written about the physical attraction/preferences because I can take care of that compatibility aspect myself. What I’m looking for help with here is the character/substance piece. It would take a lot off my plate to know that someone is somewhat pre-vetted based on the above. Support the arts; support my household composting dreams; make a romantic referral (or just share this link; see more below). If you are wanting to refer yourself, don’t; have a trusted friend reach out on your behalf instead. If you can’t get a friend to vouch for you, I regretfully am not interested.\n\nHOW TO MAKE A ROMANTIC REFERRAL I detest email but I’m trying to make this (somewhat) easy, so: Email to: chiefcuddleofficer@gmail.com Subject: Marry Val 1. Your name and relationship to the man you’re recommending 2. This man’s name 3. 2-4 sentences about why you think he’s great and how we might be compatible Thank you for your assistance with this exciting and delicious matter.\n\nANOTHER WAY TO HELP I get it, you can’t think of anyone to refer at this time. That’s fine, but if I let you off the hook with that I’ll probably get married when I’m 300, which is not what I’m going for. Instead, please share this link/page/whatever it’s called with one interesting and trusted friend. Just one! It’s so easy, please do it. People know other people, and the sooner we can get me off the market the sooner I can stop writing these posts and roping you into my romance schemes. Here’s some sample text. Use as is or make it your own: Hi (name of your friend), my friend/acquaintance/some random woman named Val is looking for a husband and asked me to share her post about it with an interesting and trusted person in my network. Please read it and keep sharing it so Val can 1. get married and 2. get off my nuts about getting married. Thanks for helping out!\n\nUPDATE: Some of this is not translating so let me try to clarify further There is no need to approach my ask through a perfectionistic lens: Of course it would be sick, ill and nasty if you could swiftly and immediately introduce me to my sweet prince, but far more realistically my wish and expectation is that you simply share this page with ONE interesting and trusted friend (not necessarily a man). Then perhaps that friend might share it with ONE interesting and trusted friend of theirs, and on and on and eventually we can arrive at some compatible matches. It’s like the chain letters of yore (remember those?) but without the crazy 90s colorful fonts and caps in weird places. The ultimate point is to marry me off, but I’m guessing the way to get there is by bringing awareness of my single-against-my-will status to a broader audience and letting networks do their magic. Is this making more sense now? Let me know if still not.\n\nOther clarifications Yes I am very open to younger men When I say I want kids I mean having my own biological kids Please only refer men you admire Love is not blind. You can creep me on instagram if you feel that this is necessary The talent search is global\n\nVal’s Substack\n\nMarry Val"

      "fullText": "Hi, my name is Andrew and welcome to my DateMe Doc.\n\nWake up refreshed. Walk to work. Do some work. Go for a walk at a\r\npleasant temperature with soft clouds and a stiff breeze. Eat some nice\r\nunhealthy food. Watch some football. Call with family. Have quiet time\r\nalone with a partner listening to their day/conversation, and focussing\r\non pleasing them. Get a good night’s sleep to repeat the day again.\n\nI have several, but none strike me as particularly odd and none that\r\nwould pick me out from a crowd as especially weird. I dress very\r\nplainly. I act generally quite quiet and speak softly unless it’s on a\r\ntopic of interest. I live pretty minimalistically (ironic that the word\r\nfor it is that long!).\n\nI don’t know what you (reader/future-partner) are looking for in\r\nlife-partners. I also cannot comment on what living with myself or just\r\nbeing around me is like without sounding biased, so I asked those who\r\nknow me best and put their answers in the below table. They are all\r\nhappy to give more details on request. I had no influence in what they\r\nsaid other than setting 3 rough categories and a character limit - I\r\nforbade myself from editing. They all submitted these independently of\r\neach other (to my knowledge) and they all came at it from their own\r\nunique relationships/histories with me. All information is accurate (in\r\ntheir opinion) at the time of their review (c. October 2025). All I\r\nconsider to be at least good friends who I have immense trust in\r\n(although one slightly less now I’ve seen their review! 😆), but they\r\nprobably like me too much and are therefore too positive.\n\nI try to avoid being photographed as best I can, so a representative\r\nsample is not possible. I detest wearing suits, but black & white is\r\nfine.\n\nAs is hopefully obvious to most readers of this document, the\r\npopulation size of those who want to date me is small (but crucially\r\nnon-zero). If that’s not you but you would like to message me out of\r\ngeneral interest/friendship/matchmaking-with-someone-else purposes, I’m\r\nall ears. I can share a semi-secret personal blog if you would like to\r\nread more of my musings.\n\nIf enough of this sounds like it’s up your street, then feel free to\r\ncontact me at AndrewEADateMe@gmail.com with any questions,\r\na funny dad-joke, and/or any relevant details/links about yourself and\r\nwe can take it from there.\n\nI may have given a slightly misleading impression of how\r\nmathematically minded I am in the “My\r\nInterests” table for comedic purposes. I basically find almost any\r\ntopic that requires thinking to be interesting and worth discussing. But\r\nI cannot hide that I am an enthusiastically mathematical person and this\r\nwas my best way of making that very clear and filtering out people who\r\nmight find that off-putting.\n\n(*): If you scrolled to the end (thank you!), then I expect you’re\r\nsufficiently interested but non-mathematical 1 , so to be clear I’ll\r\nprobably be in my early 30s when you’re reading this. If this statement\r\nis incorrect then it’s probably safe to say hardly anyone is reading\r\nthis by then and/or I might have forgotten I have made this document or\r\nnot bothered to exhaustively debug all dates.\n\nOr mathematical-enough to work it out yet mildly lazy,\r\nwhich is fine by me - the best maths is motivated by lethargy! I did\r\nconsider writing some Javascript to dynamically change the document\r\nbased on the current date, but I’m definitely too lazy for that. ↩︎\n\nPositive of living with you - organised, tidy, routines, easy to coexist alongside\n\nPositive of spending time with you - knowledgeable about a wide range of interesting topics, can provide a different way of looking at things\n\nNegative of living with you - limited cooking / meal options, somewhat white / beige decorating (this may not be up to date)\n\nNegative of spending time with you - collective indecisiveness (this goes both ways 😂)\n\nMakes you feel welcome\n\nRespects space + boundaries\n\nHappy to match vibes on levels of social interaction\n\nPragmatic to a fault: will keep house + lifestyle in exactly the optimal state for comfortable living\n\nwill keep house + lifestyle in exactly the optimal state for comfortable living\n\nExceptionally laid-back and at-ease with what happens\n\nPolite and easy-going (sometimes to a fault)\n\nStop being so damn considerate all the time (sometimes borders on frustrating)\n\nFinds it hard to accept gifts/offers of things (run several miles rather than accept a lift)\n\nDistaste for strong flavours and homedecorating\n\nMake a sandwich by bringing the whole bag, making it as you go\n\nLikes white bread a lot, more than the average person\n\nHonest when it comes to dating. He really is trying to give you the best sense of what he’s like so both you and he can make a good call\n\nStrongly defined. He’s clear about what he knows he likes and can tell you all about it and why, with fun puzzles to solve along the way. That said\n\nOpen to talking about anything I’m interested in. I’ve brought up and sent all sorts of entirely unrelated things his way (some of our interests/thoughts align, many differ) and he always has interesting things to ask/say/contribute and seems to have fun doing so\n\nSeems generally content, which is really nice to be around. Long walks in company are fun.\n\nThoughtfully proactive: He’ll plan stuff, send you the potential details and check in to see if you’re up for it, pick up little things for you, checks in if you need anything etc.\n\nEmotional response to you can be unclear/hard to read in person, and is expressed through writing (where to be fair, it is clear). The disparity between in person and writing can be pretty confusing and takes a while to get used to\n\nSexual attraction to you also harder to gauge if not explicitly brought up\n\nLess focus in general on the arts/conventional fun/aesthetically pleasing/hedonistic side of life (this one may be most personal-to-me: I happen to think a more balance is nice for a whole host of reasons)\n\nDate Me Doc\n\nMe & You\n\nMy Interests\n\nIdeal Day\n\nQuirks\n\nReviews\n\nReviews Table\n\nImages\n\nSuitability\n\nAction\n\nDisclaimer(s)"

      "fullText": "This is the archived version of an online dating profile I created in October 2024, which I created for friends to set me up with their friends. “dateblake.com” previously redirected here.\n\nI’m looking for a relationship! Like, a serious relationship. A Big Relationship. While I met all my previous loves through organic/IRL activities, I’m open to connecting with someone online. Maybe that’s you! 😱💘 Let’s go.\n\nBecause weird is the only way to be! But perhaps you mean desperate , because I have my own dating page? I don’t see this as an act of desperation, rather an intentional experiment in service of ONE OF LIFE’S BIGGEST DECISIONS . Algorithms dictate enough of our lives already—looking at you, Discover Weekly—and the apps are full of too many Perfectly Nice Normal People craving Perfectly Nice Normal Lives .\n\nI’m weird in many ways. Ever since I was a child, I’ve had an active imagination and voracious intellect. A few good books and unconventional mentors radically influenced my young adult trajectory. I’ve lived much of my life in community, in nature, on the road, and as a guest. ( This is a fairly typical Blake-year.) I’m fueled by big projects, new horizons, and deep connections. Normal jobs, homes, and relationships aren’t exactly my thing. So here I am, seeking a partner-in-crime in my own weird way.\n\nThe links go to my writing , evidence of my particular brand of weirdness .\n\nI’ll offer a few concrete details and then describe the spirit of the thing.\n\nDetails: You’re a fit, strong, outdoorsy woman. You have pooped in the woods. You have pooped in the woods! You’re in a good financial position: bills don’t stress you out each month, giving you options in life, not just obligations. You have solo traveled abroad. You have solo traveled abroad! You’ve found an interesting way to earn money doing something meaningful. Your work doesn’t dominate your life, and you enjoy time wealth . You’re a lover of ideas who reads books, listens to podcasts, and debates with friends. You may or may not want kids, or already have them. You’re not entangled with an ex. Your age probably begins with a “3.” You’re ready for something real—not necessarily forever, but real.\n\nSpirit: Rarely have you felt like you “fit in” anywhere in particular. It’s hard to stay settled, because you know how big the world is, and you want to experience it. Friendships matter deeply to you, as do the people you serve. You have a profound relationship with nature which cannot play second fiddle to city life for very long. You’re not looking for someone to complete you, as you are already complete. Your other, non-romantic relationships could genuinely sustain you. But you see romantic partnership as another great adventure, one you don’t want to miss. You have a long-standing orientation toward freedom, both for yourself and your partner. Freedom inclines you toward commitment.\n\nGreat conversation, moral support, foot/back rubs, mountain adventure partnership, co-counseling in the style of “why not attempt this seemingly crazy but delicious idea?”, creative collaboration, spontaneous dances, quiet evenings reading together on a couch, winters spent together in sunny places, petting cats on the street, plenty of time+space to do your own thing—and tacos, so many tacoooos! 🌮🌮🌮\n\nMaybe a co-parent who seriously buys into the “travel the world with kids” notion. Maybe a child-free partner who nonetheless enjoys hanging with friends’ kids and taking them on amazing adventures. 100%: a trustworthy, high-stoke, sun-loving, cheery-optimistic California boy.\n\nMama always said, “date a boy who can dance.” Evidence: 1 / 2\n\nValid question! Wouldn’t it be nice if we lived in the same place and could casually meet like NORMAL PEOPLE? Alas, unlikely to happen. So here’s my next best idea.\n\nWe ended our journey after eight countries, 3,500 miles and 21 days in the same clothes. Our romantic relationship intact, Jeff and I boarded the Heathrow return flight as closer friends than ever (despite the questionable state of our undergarments). Materially speaking I was as empty-handed as the day we started, but I actually carried a great deal back home across the Atlantic. Traveling with no luggage and no plans was much more than a minimalist lesson in living well with less. It was an intense, in-your-face invitation to the unknown. There’s a truly magnificent side to the unknown, but we aren’t taught how to welcome it, let alone explore the breadth of its possibilities.\n\nSome years ago, I asked close friends to write dating endorsements , which are like job references but far more entertaining.  👉🏽 Here’s what they said 👈🏽\n\nAnd here are some fictional references from my exes , which I wrote:\n\nE1 : “Blake’s a lot of fun, and very enthusiastic. He can also fall in love awfully quickly. Maybe dial down the romanticism from a 10 to a 7?”\n\nE2 : “It was pretty easy to live with Blake. I was also flexibly self-employed, and it was nice to spend time together when others were working 9-to-5. He helped me with my art shows. It kinda sucked when he went away for multiple months on those teen trips. He’s got some sort of addiction to the mountains, like it’s some core part of his identity. He judged me for not being ‘adventurous’ enough. Get over yourself, man.”\n\nE3 : “Blake and I fell for each other despite living on different continents. We loved going to dances together. In the beginning it was invigorating, but eventually I realized that he’s probably never, ever, going to settle down. I wanted to have a rather normal life in a single place, while he wanted to live in some magical land of infinite possibility, sunshine, and chocolate. I do appreciate the effort he put into establishing a friendship after we broke up. Dating Blake could be chaotic, but it was a meaningful, memorable kind of chaos.”\n\nE4 : “He’s a great cycle touring partner. He’ll cook for you and clean your kitchen afterwards. And it’s fun to work on creative projects together. Beyond that, I’m not sure what to say.

      "fullText": "Adam: Male, Straight, 6'2\", Monogamous, Wants Kids, Boston (but open to lots of travel initially), born 1993. adamjermyn@gmail.com\n\nI feel motivated by family, by curiosity, and by doing what I think is right:\n\nWe're more likely to be compatible if:\n\nI'm looking for a long-term romantic partner to build a life and raise a family with. Building a life together means being a team—spending substantial time together, sharing our inner worlds, making sense of the world as thought partners, and navigating challenges side-by-side.\n\nIn practice, this might look like:\n\nI’m really excited about having kids. My ideal is probably 3-4, though the common advice of “see how you feel after each one” makes a lot of sense to me—it’s genuinely hard to predict how life will go! What matters is that I’m starting from a place of wanting a larger family, and I’d hope that’s something you’re keen on too.\n\nFor me a huge part of the point of having kids is being actively involved and present in their lives, so I'd expect to spend a lot of my time/energy parenting (potentially including home schooling, if we decided that made the most sense), and want a partner who's motivated by the same. I'm genuinely eager to do half of the parenting work.\n\nI have a pretty direct communication style in partnership. I usually know what I want and ask for it straightforwardly. If you know what you want and ask for it I'll be very receptive to that!\n\nI also have a pretty good memory, supplemented by a spaced repetition system, so if you tell me a preference/want/need you have there's an excellent chance I'll remember it from that point on.\n\nOn the flip side, early on in knowing someone I'm not especially good at picking up on some more subtle forms of communication, but as I get to know someone (especially a partner) I get better at picking up on what's going on with them, and in the long run can be pretty good at this.\n\nPhysical intimacy is a really important part of what I'm looking for, both at first and in the long run. If it's not important to you or doesn't sound like what you want long-term, we're probably not a good match!\n\nI know these things don't just magically work, and that connection is something you build with time and care and trust. I'm very here for that. What matters is that we're both people who actively desire and prioritize physical connection as an ongoing part of our relationship, so that we can prioritize finding ways to connect physically and treat that as being as central as e.g. emotional connection.\n\nBeyond that I'll be excited to hear about your preferences and find things we're both keen on. Communication is important to me, and I really appreciate when my partners ask for what they want. I'm also pretty open to exploring here, and won't be put off by you asking for something new!\n\nIntellectual partnership is really important to me. It's part of how I feel seen and secure—knowing we have a shared way of making sense of the world. I love conversations that go deep, whether we're teaching each other from our different domains or figuring something out together. You don't need to work in AI or physics, but you do need to be someone who finds joy in engaging with complex ideas and being a thought partner.\n\nI come from a family of planners, so I tend to spot things that need doing quite a ways off and plan accordingly. I also tend to get anxious when it feels like my partner and I aren't on the same page about where we're going / what we're aiming for long-term (even if we don't stick to those plans / even as life twists and turns).\n\nYou don't need to be a natural planner yourself, but it's important that you're willing to engage in those conversations with me - to think together about our direction and make plans as a team. If the thought of having regular check-ins about where we're headed (long-term and short-term) doesn't appeal to you, we're probably not a good match!\n\nI think money is a resource we can use to fulfill our values, including personal consumption but also values like altruism and community. I don't think it's bad to spend money, and I don't think frugality is a virtue (beyond the virtue of living within our means).\n\nOn a practical level, I'm fortunate to have a job that means I can comfortably support a family financially on just my income. I'm very happy to share financial responsibility, and at the same time I can imagine a relationship with someone who wants to spend more time with the kids, or who wants to study full-time, or who wants to pursue a career for passion rather than pay.\n\nFamily is important to me. I grew up as the youngest of three and have a large extended family of cousins (mostly in New England). I have really fond memories of large gatherings at my grandparents’ home, and that’s something I’d love for my kids to get to experience.\n\nThese days we do large family vacations together, as well as smaller gatherings, and spending time with my family is one of the most rewarding things I do. It's important to me for you to join me in this (and my family is really, truly welcoming!), and I'd be excited to join you with your family too.\n\nI think there's a lot of wisdom in religious traditions, and also there are a lot of restrictions in the details of observance that can run counter to my values, so I tend to err on the side of less observance and more \"spirit of the law\".\n\nI was raised in a conservative Jewish household, and identify as atheist but culturally Jewish. I'd be happy to make a mostly-secular home together (which could incorporate traditions from other religions), or something in the \"reform-to-conservative\" Jewish spectrum. So e.g. I love to host and attend Shabbat dinners, I think the high holidays are a great time for family gatherings, and I think there's a lot of beautiful music in the liturgy. At the same time many of the specifics of observance run counter to my values so I steer clear of those (e.g. not travelling on Shabbat makes it hard to see family, not using a phone on Shabbat is dangerous if an emergency arises, etc.). If strict observance is important to you we're probably not a good fit.\n\nMy kitchen currently is kosher (non-hechsher dairy) as a practical matter, because that makes it easier to host and contribute to meals with community , but I’m definitely open to changing that if it conflicts with your values.\n\nAlso: I believe quite strongly in a material universe, and would find it difficult to have a partner who believes that the world is influenced by the supernatural (e.g. deities, magic, etc.). So much of my worldview is built on materialism and physical reductionism that I would find it hard to live with integrity in close partnership with someone who doesn't share that understanding of the world.\n\nGiving credit where it’s due: I got the idea to write this doc and a lot of inspiration around e.g. what to include from my friend & colleague Chris Olah, who wrote a similar doc for himself several years ago.\n\nI chose to live in Boston to be close to family, even though this introduced significant challenges to my career.\n\nI studied Physics and Astronomy because I find awe and wonder in the natural world, and especially the stars, and have a deep curiosity about how it all works.\n\nThree years ago I left Astronomy to work on AI Safety after almost a decade of study and work because I think AI is going to change the world, and it's important to make sure that change is positive. I'm now a research lead on Anthropic's Interpretability team .\n\nI produce a lot of creative artifacts. From journal articles to blog posts to paintings, almost all of my time is spent creating something I can share with others.\n\nI'm really excited to have kids with the right partner, ideally in the next 3-5 years , and I'm genuinely eager to do half of the parenting work. My parents are also amazing with kids, and it's likely they'd be around and able to help (especially if we have kids on the sooner side).\n\nI'm happy and able to comfortably support a family financially, even a large one, on just my income. So while I'm very happy to share financial responsibility, I can also imagine a relationship with someone who wants to spend more time with the kids, or who wants to pursue a career for passion rather than pay.\n\nI care a lot about doing what I think is right, which includes being scrupulously honest and holding myself to a high standard of integrity.\n\nI genuinely delight in lifting my partner up. I have a strong supportive instinct, so I'd love to provide encouragement, coaching, and help in charting a course towards your hopes and dreams, and I'd love to have your help in turn with mine.\n\nI tend to see things that need to be done far in advance, and can do the research to make it happen even in difficult circumstances. For instance, at the height of the pandemic I wrote analyses of COVID testing protocols and transmission mechanics that correctly predicted subsequent expert consensus several months in advance.\n\nI host a lot of recurring events for friends (boardgame nights, \"quiet reading & tea\" nights, bagel brunches on the weekends). I find hosting energizing and get a lot out of providing a \"third space\" for community . A lot of my choices have been motivated by wanting to make this possible.\n\nI'm very agentic when it comes to my health and that of those around me (to the extent this is welcome). I've written literature reviews on medical questions for friends / partners who wanted help navigating unusual questions where it's otherwise hard to get actionable advice.\n\nI'm pretty self-reflective, which can sometimes tip into overthinking things I've said or done, or am planning to do. This comes up most in professional settings but you'll likely see it occasionally in a relationship too. I've made some progress on this but it's still something I'm actively working on.\n\nI spend a lot of time \"living in the future\" (e.g. anticipating what might happen, both positive and negative, related to above), and sometimes need help grounding in the moment. This is also something I have experience doing for friends / partners so I'm very happy to reciprocate if you need the same.\n\nI find conflict somewhat aversive, and have to push myself to engage in important disagreements outside of technical topics. I know conflict is important, and I can get myself to engage in difficult conversations when necessary, but I've historically been slow to do so. In the last year or so I've made a lot of progress on this, and I expect to keep getting better at it in the near future.\n\nAs a contrast to the last point, I really care about the truth, and am likely to push back on things I don't think are true in conversation, which can come across as disagreeable. Of course this same tendency can be a plus, since it means I try my best to be honest and act with integrity, and I work hard to update my views in the face of evidence.\n\nI get migraines. Untreated, these were very bad. With medication they're well-controlled, but I still try to avoid triggers like very loud environments and sleep deprivation. When I'm sick (e.g. with a cold) the medication is much less effective, and I'm reasonably likely to be totally out-of-commission 2-3 days out of a week-long illness. There are also occasionally times when I need to duck out of plans and find a dark/quiet place.\n\nYou're excited about the natural world and want to spend time in it. Think walks on beaches, easy-to-moderate hikes, botanical gardens, national parks, and the night sky. Hiking especially is something I do a lot, and being able to share that would mean a lot to me.\n\nYou're excited about some technical subject (science, math, economics, etc.). I really love talking with people who can teach me new things, or who can share in the joy of discovery together, or who're curious about these subjects. I'm truly delighted to spend an evening digging into a thorny question with a thought partner.\n\nYou value your own integrity , and know how to act on that. This might mean being truth-seeking, forming your own moral views, setting boundaries, and advocating for what you want/need.\n\nYou bring intentionality to the relationship. Creating dedicated time and space for connection—whether that's regular check-ins, rituals we build together, or simply being present with each other—matters a lot to me.\n\nI'm monogamous.\n\nI'm looking to have biological kids. I'm flexible about timelines, and want to be sure to build a strong and close relationship first. My guess is that means somewhere in the next 3-5 years, but I could imagine moving faster if that feels right. I'd want us to be proactive about fertility considerations (like egg freezing if needed) so we have options. Being on the same page about this is really important.\n\nI'm politically moderate / a \"classical liberal\". If you're looking for someone who's far left or far right, that's not me (and I have many views that don't fall neatly on the left-right spectrum).\n\nI'm open to starting a relationship long-distance with regular visits. If things are going well though I'd like to find a way to co-locate / be in the same city. I'm pretty firmly rooted in Boston, so while it's not impossible that I could move, it's also not very likely.\n\nMy work is based in SF and I have to periodically travel there (currently 1 week / 2 months, though the cadence is somewhat flexible). If you wanted to join me on some of those trips that would be very exciting.\n\nReading\n\nBoardgames (Spirit Island is my favorite, more generally I really like cooperative games)\n\nVideogames (mostly Halo, some Factorio)\n\nWalks / Hikes\n\nTravel (especially to the American West)\n\nExercise (I got really into strength training during the pandemic and have kept that up)\n\nHosting\n\nSinging / voice lessons\n\nLiterature reviews / trying to figure out something that confuses me about the world\n\nI don't smoke or use any illegal drugs. I also drink very little (it makes me sleep poorly). I don't mind if you drink in moderation. Smoking (including non-tobacco products) is a dealbreaker for me.\n\nI don't mind cats, but wouldn't want to have one. There's a lot of risk of parasites with a cat in the home that I'm just not keen on.\n\nI put a lot of thought into designing my spaces to be functional but also warm, and I find it pretty easy to keep them neat/organized. My current home has a lot of hard wood, big windows, bookshelves, seating space, rugs, and indoor trees.\n\nI enjoy Marmite and chutneys (separately).\n\nI've hosted a (mostly) weekly boardgame night for over two years.\n\nI once walked 17 miles from Cambridge, England to the city of Ely. Along the way a cow chased me away because I got too close to her calf.\n\nI'm mostly not excited about dogs, but would be very excited to have a Golden Doodle specifically. They're just so... friendly and grounding and fun. The further a dog gets from \"Golden Doodle\" energy the less excited I am.\n\nMany of the fossils in my fossil collection are ones I found in the ground in England (oh and also, I have a fossil collection!).\n\nWeekend mornings with coffee and long conversations, maybe followed by time at the gym or going on a hike together.\n\nDedicating time regularly to ask \"how are you?\" and really hold space for the answer, whether it's joyous, difficult, or somewhere in between.\n\nEvening conversations where we process our days and think through the implications of our work together.\n\nSupporting each other's growth and fulfillment—not just cheerleading, but actively helping chart a course toward what matters and coaching each other through challenges.\n\nHosting brunch for friends on Sunday, building community together.\n\nA balance of intentional together time and comfortable quiet downtime.\n\nWho am I?\n\nWhat am I looking for?\n\nPros of dating me\n\nCons\n\nVibes\n\nSome Important Things\n\nWhat I do in my free time\n\nThings I'm not into\n\nSome Random Facts About Me\n\nKids\n\nParenting\n\nCommunication\n\nPhysical Intimacy\n\nIntellectual Connection\n\nCoordination\n\nMoney\n\nFamily\n\nReligion"

( what is a date me doc? )\n\nGeorge Wang 31 / male / 6'1\" Location: SF (flexible) Relationship type: Straight, monogamous Kids: Maybe? Ask me about it\n\nMy pronouns are he/him but they could be all/yours :)\n\nMy love language is sending people more blog posts / essays than anyone can reasonably be expected to read\n\nThese are things I'm fairly sure I want:\n\n(To be clear, I'm not perfect at all of these myself!)\n\nEarly dates might be activities where it's easy to talk at the same time: hikes, bouldering, board games, cooking dinner together, etc. A lot of early bonding happens through talking and texting for me.\n\nAfter we're a bit more comfortable, we might hang out more frequently, stay the night regularly, and text throughout the day about increasingly mundane things (live-tweeting your life to someone is a real love language, fight me). I also enjoy just being in the same room, so if you also work remotely, we might cowork together often.\n\nLong-term, I'd like to live together and build our relationship into a source of mutual growth. It sounds super cliche but I mean it sincerely – I'd love to have a partnership where we keep inspiring each other to be better. I also travel a decent amount for work reasons (mostly conferences), but usually in great places to visit (last year was unusually travel-heavy, but I visited Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Melbourne, and the Bay Area). It's always nice to tack some extra time on either end, and a travel partner would be even better!\n\nI have an okay amount of social energy but am more introvert than extrovert and have decided that I mostly don't enjoy activities that involve lots of noise and not much personal space (concerts, clubs, etc). There are some exceptions, but in general I wouldn't expect this to be the kind of thing we regularly do together.\n\nI do like trips outdoors and would love to camp / hike / climb together!\n\nThis is a fairly curated window into who I am, and reality is always more complicated. I don't know what the right discount factor is, but you should apply at least a little.\n\nIf you still feel interested, then reach out! Yes, you reading this doc. If you're not sure, please err on the side of getting in contact, that's what this thing is for! The downside might be a small time cost, and the upside is hugely positive for both of us. Don't leave that +EV on the table.\n\nEmail me , message me on Twitter , or ask a mutual friend to introduce us. No need for it to be a big deal either, just say hi and we can go from there!\n\nBlog\n\nGames\n\nAbout + Contact\n\nDating\n\nOne of my more load-bearing beliefs is that the world is fundamentally malleable to our actions. That the world can be a better place, that we have the power to improve it, and that we should try . The main way I currently relate to this is through technological progress. I think AI is going to make the next decade really weird , and not all in good ways. As soon as I was convinced this was true, I dropped what I was doing to focus on making this societal transition safer . This was a difficult decision with various sacrifices, the most legible of which was a ~75% pay cut (I'm lucky to have financial stability from some earlier successes), but I think this was the right thing to do and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe main way I currently relate to this is through technological progress.

This was a difficult decision with various sacrifices, the most legible of which was a ~75% pay cut (I'm lucky to have financial stability from some earlier successes), but I think this was the right thing to do and I'm glad I did.\n\nAnother of my defining values is growth: I see myself as a constant work in progress. This means many things to me — being a better friend, a better partner, a better citizen. It means being a sharper scientist as much as it means healing old emotional wounds, and it means developing better habits as much as it means figuring out how to relate to my existential angst.\n\nThe way I move through and understand the world is fairly Bay Area rationalist coded, which sometimes makes me seem like a system-2-robot kind of person, but I think I have at least as much system-1-hopeless-idealist in me. (more recently on a \"postrat\" arc, though I kinda think the distinction is wrong? anyways, mostly this looks like getting much more interested in buddhism)\n\n(more recently on a \"postrat\" arc, though I kinda think the distinction is wrong? anyways, mostly this looks like getting much more interested in buddhism)\n\nI take commitments seriously, which might come off as \"reliable\" to some people and \"annoyingly conscientious\" to others.\n\nThe world is full of side quests and I regularly get nerd-sniped by them. I've built an automated arbitrage bot for MtG:O (and eventually got banned 😬), dabbled in sports betting, made a couple of small games , and occasionally drop everything I'm doing to chase down alpha in financial markets.\n\nI'm a bit of a dork and love games. One of my favorite framing of games is as art working in the medium of agency . I see games as a place to be playful, to be creative, to laugh, to cry, to feel both joy and fear, to compete, and to face challenges and overcome them.\n\nIf you like my writing, you'll probably like talking to me. A few that I like that aren't too domain specific: My PhD cost me $1.17M (but I'd do it again) , Sharing is caring , Navigating burnout\n\nYou have strong values. We don't have to share all of them, but there are things that matter to you that you'd defend (they don't have to be grand, world-shattering things).\n\nYou're proactive about shaping your life. When you run into problems or see opportunities, you jump in.\n\nYou're kind and empathetic towards others. You try even when it's hard, including those you might not personally like or agree with.\n\nYou're deeply curious about the world. You care about what's true and want to learn together.\n\nYou're playful! Fun is a terminal value :)\n\nI don't politically identify as far left or far right. Socially, I tend to be more progressive, but otherwise I have somewhat scattered political positions.\n\nI'm not religious. I respect those who have deeply held religious beliefs, but this  probably means we understand the world in very fundamentally different ways.\n\nI lean towards lower thresholds for sensitivity to disgust. The kinds of compromises I try to aim for seemed to generally be fine in past relationships (and at least one partner was more germophobic than me), but if you have particularly high thresholds for disgust, this might generate friction.\n\nSign up\n\nDate Me Doc\n\nAbout me\n\nAbout you\n\nAbout... us? 👉👈\n\nPossible dealbreakers?\n\nWhat next?"

      "fullText": "Imagine me in a bookstore or coffee shop, chatting with friends or next to a stack of books I want to read. That's me! You'll also see me line dancing, making this face (🥹♥️) at animals, spending time with my nieces, or planting seeds on my balcony to see what will grow.\n\nName: Roxanne\n\nAge: 36\n\nLocation: Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada\n\nOccupation: Customer Support and Administration for Pro Church Tools\n\nWorldview/Beliefs: I’m a Christian and firmly have following the ways of Jesus Christ and attending church as foundations in my life.\n\nPersonality type : ENFJ/ENFP - depending on the day I take the online quiz 😅\n\nNeed a wedding dance party date? I’m your girl!\n\nSo far, Hermione is my ideal partner! (Look how cute she is 🥹😍)\n\nRelationship Goals: A husband 😋 I’m looking for someone who is looking for something serious. Someone who is wanting to build a relationship that will weather the highs and lows of life.\n\nIdeal Partner:\n\nValues: Kindness, respectfulness, positivity, good sense of humour, ability to have fun, decorum, generosity, and passion for both loving God and loving the people around them. 🤗\n\nInstagram: RoxyWiedemann\n\nTikTok: RoxyWiedemann\n\n💌 Rlwiedemann@live.ca\n\nMy Faith: I’m a passionate follower of Jesus Christ, and love talking about it! So much so that when I graduated high school I went to college for Christian Theology and graduated with a B.Th (graduated with honours).\n\nFamily: I’m a small town girl with a big family. I have four sisters, and a brother, and now have several nieces, with (I’m sure) more coming in the future. I’m close with my family and prioritize staying in touch and showing up for holidays and special events, as well as taking care of each other when we need it. It’s important to me that whoever I date recognizes and supports this priority, and I look forward to getting to know and love your family as well.\n\nLearning: I love learning new things - whether that’s through listening to podcasts, taking classes, or trying out new hobbies. (Some recent ones have been vocal lessons, figure skating, line dancing, and an acrylic painting class) 🤓\n\nReading: Give me a good story, a cozy corner, and a cup of coffee and I’m happy girl! Even better if it includes a rainy fall day, an oversized sweater, and a candle. 📚\n\nDancing: Catch me line dancing pretty much every week, and keeping wedding dance parties going long into the night. 💃🏻\n\nHaving A Good Sense of Humour (and being kind and generous) In All Circumstances : I get it - sometimes life sucks, things don’t go your way, and people can be the worst. But staying positive, kind, and having the ability to find the humour and laugh even in the midst of disappointment or frustration is important to me. If you’re able to balance taking serious things seriously with making jokes at the craziness of life, and facing each person you meet with generosity and kindness even when they’re frustrating you - then we’ll be a great fit. 😊\n\nSomeone who gives major golden retriever energy , who loves life, is outgoing (or at least doesn’t need to be babysat at social events) makes the best of every circumstance, and does so with thoughtfulness towards those around him.\n\nSomeone who loves God deeply and wants to reflect that love to the world around them.\n\nSomeone free spirited and adventurous with enough grounding to commit to a long term relationship with a toe-dipping girl like me. ♥️\n(Big bonus points if you smell nice and give life altering hugs)\n\nFood: I, along with all of my biological siblings, have an autoimmune condition called Celiac Disease (a severe reaction to eating gluten). This means my life is strictly gluten free. Thankfully this can still be delicious, and I love trying out new gluten free recipes, and dream of mastering a gluten free loaf of bread. 🍞\n\nMusic: My music taste is wide ranging from musical scores (don’t even get me started on Titans Spirit from Remember the Titans!), pop country, jazz, alt rock, and 80s pop/retro pop. 🎶\n\nPets: two cats, Artemis and Hermione. I love them with my whole heart 😻\n\nHobbies: Reading, ice skating, line dancing, painting/sketching, neighbourhood strolls, and admiring a good sunset. (Oh, and going on passionate rants about how important in person relationships are, and how much being online has disrupted the goodness of life 😅)\n\n🔍 About me\n\n🔥 My passions\n\n🕵️ What I am looking for\n\n👀 Fun facts about me!\n\n📱 Let’s connect"

      "fullText": "My name is Alex, but I've been called other things like “space wizard” (by a friend), \"clever iconoclast\" (by an ex-girlfriend), and “a very pleasant gentleman” (by my Orthopedic surgeon in his discharge notes). I'm a 31-year-old cis guy living in the Midtown district of Kansas City, working as an IT Analyst for an international law firm. I'm a philosophy and ethics nerd, but I also love insane adventures and chill evenings in. I’m highly versatile!\n\nI am on a journey to find someone who makes me feel emotionally safe, intellectually stimulated, and spiritually inspired. I hope to be that for them as well.\n\nI care deeply about humanity in general, and I also think every person is valuable and beautiful simply by virtue of being human. Absurdism and Rationality are core values of mine, and I geek out on all sorts of intellectual conversations. However, just talking isn’t enough for me. That's why I organize a local Effective Altruism group, where we explore how we can do the most good for the world, and I donate 10% of my income to effective charities. I founded a startup for community-based self-improvement, which is my passion project. I’m also vegan, for ethical, health, and environmental reasons.\n\nI am not really into clubs or bars. I go maybe once a month or so for the dancing, or to the local arcade bar for the games, but loud environments that I have to shout over are not my usual choice.\n\nMy idea of fun includes things like Dungeons and Dragons, cooking with friends, urban exploration, watching good movies/shows , hiking in nature, and foraging for mushrooms (even though I despise the way they taste 😅). I’m also constantly reading, check out my reading list here !\n\nI love cats; I have a cat named Loki. She is very well-behaved and affectionate. I like dogs too, though! I just don’t currently have the space for one in my apartment.\n\nI also attend Burning Man every year, with a nerdy camp of tabletop roleplaying gamers. You are welcome to join me! Or not, whatever floats your boat. :)\n\nI love traveling, and would consider moving somewhere else mid-term, but I have a preference for staying anchored to Kansas City in the short-term. I’m trying to foster the local Effective Altruism/Rationality scenes, which is a mission that means a lot to me.\n\nAs far as spirituality is concerned, I’m a strict materialist at my core (I think Madonna had it right). However, I believe recapturing some sense of the sacred is important for a meaningful life, and I love chatting about religion and meaning-making. A friend once called me “the most spiritual non-spiritual person I know”. I think the universe (especially consciousness) is a lot weirder than most materialists give it credit for. I’ve even been known to dabble in Tarot and such for the fun of it. However, the key is that I believe we are physical beings in a physical universe, and I do not think that there exist any minds apart from bodies such as gods, spirits, or anything like that.\n\nBecause I do not believe in any afterlife, I believe that death is bad, and that one of the human race’s most important long-term goals should be shielding sentient minds from it. I also believe that extreme suffering is the foundation of ethics. Despite my mostly Consequentialist views on ethics, I believe that conscious creatures have an inherent dignity, and should not be subjugated or commercialized.\n\nThe Big Five (aka “OCEAN”)  model of personality is the best predictor of life outcomes, including romantic outcomes! According to this study , low Neuroticism, plus high Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness are great predictors of romantic satisfaction. I’m proud to say I score well on that front! You can see my full breakdown here .\n\nMy biggest weaknesses is that, within Neuroticism, despite scoring low on aggregate, I score high on Immoderation. It can be tough for me to pace myself on ice cream sometimes. 😉 But this is easily remedied with systems, such as making sure I don’t stock unhealthy foods in the house, and putting limits on my phone usage.\n\nMy goal is to live with a life partner/spouse.

I want to be with someone who similarly values honesty.\n\nStaying in shape and taking care of myself physically is important to me, and I want someone who also takes care of themselves. I have a workout routine, a facial care routine, I shower daily, and go above and beyond with dental hygiene. I keep my BMI in a healthy and attractive range. Let’s be a hot power couple together. 😉\n\nI am ambivalent on the subject of children. I can see myself really enjoying being a parent, if my partner is enthusiastically on board. If you have a strong preference either way, I am happy to defer to you. However, I do have a moderate preference for adoption if I do have kids. Willing to discuss. (Note: I have had a Vasectomy; and while they have a 60%-90% chance of reversal, any biological children might have to be conceived via IVF or some other artificial means).\n\nI think I'm a pretty cool person, and I put in a lot of effort to be the kind of partner I'd want to be with.

      "fullText": "About Blog Projects\n\nMy name is Erik Lönnroth, and I am looking to meet the love of my life. I’ve written this doc to help you decide whether I'm someone worth getting to know. I’ve tried to be as honest about my shortcomings as I am about my strengths.\n\nI’m 39 years old, 175cm (5'9) and fortunate to be in excellent health. I’m from Sweden but live in Cape Town and currently work remotely for a strategy consulting firm based in London. I triangulate between these three locations in order to maintain my career, friendships, and family ties. I’m fluent in Swedish, English and French, and can get by in a handful of other human and computer languages.\n\nAs much as I love Cape Town for its stunning nature and colourful characters, I would consider relocating for the right person.\n\nI don’t have any kids, but hope to one day get married and start a family. If you have kids, that’s perfectly fine, as long as you’re open to having a few more.\n\nIf I have a superpower, it’s my ability to observe a situation from multiple perspectives. I look for the grain of truth in each point of view, rather than rejecting any as wholly wrong or bad. I then seek to find a way forward by integrating the nuggets of wisdom from each perspective into a coherent whole. Sometimes this process can make me slow at decision making. But once I’ve decided, I don’t tend to look back. To balance out my analytical tendencies, I appreciate having a partner with a well honed intuition. Someone who can say “this feels right” and trust her gut. Importantly though, she needs to be good at reasoning from first principles so we can resolve disagreements respectfully.\n\nAlthough I wouldn’t describe myself as conventionally religious, spirituality is the foundation of my life. I maintain a daily meditation practice that has taken years to cultivate, but I’ve finally found the key to consistency. Once or twice a year I attend Zen retreats in Europe or the US. These periods of intense practice have frequently sparked profound awakenings for me, leading to greater clarity, connectedness, and wisdom.\n\nI would like my partner to walk the spiritual path with me, not as my student or teacher, but as my equal. Your practice doesn’t necessarily have to be sitting meditation; it could be yoga, breathwork, prayer, embodiment practices, or anything else that opens your heart and mind. What matters is that you approach it with utmost dedication and deep curiosity. Ultimately, I view marriage as a vessel for two individuals to experience the Divine through Love, and I want my wife to share this vision for our relationship. That doesn’t mean that everything we talk about has to be imbued with the language of sacredness — 99% of the time it won’t — only that we have a shared understanding of our deepest purpose on this planet: to help each other awaken. Whether you believe in God or not matters less to me than your capacity to take on each day recognising the precious gift that it is to simply be alive! My greatest fear is finding myself on my deathbed facing the bitter realisation that I held back out of fear, never daring to love fully.\n\nI’ve dedicated my career to building innovative approaches to learning, mostly in Africa, where educational institutions are currently failing half a billion children. Over the years I’ve launched literacy interventions in Kenya, developed tablet-based teaching solutions in Zambia, and run an online mathematics tutoring startup in South Africa. At times a Quixotic mission, it has nevertheless been immensely fascinating and fulfilling.\n\nI have an insatiable curiosity about people and things. I subscribe to a wide array of newspapers, blogs, and podcasts on everything from finance and technology to psychology and history. Admittedly, this sometimes feels like drinking out of a firehose, and I’m increasingly wondering whether I might in fact be better off on a minimal information diet. If we end up dating, one of the ways you can help me stay present is to keep reminding me to put my phone/laptop away. Preferably in another room.\n\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence that as someone who constantly seeks to integrate different perspectives, I divide my time between northern Europe and southern Africa. Africa is vivid, colourful, crazy, and often dysfunctional — it unlocks my adventurous spirit while allowing me to appreciate the things we take for granted in the developed world. Europe, on the other hand, offers me career opportunities, family ties, and cultural belonging. As much as I would love to continue having one foot in each continent, I’m also prepared to give that up and commit to one location for the sake of marriage, if my partner is unable to follow my migratory patterns.\n\nI love being active and staying in shape. I’m training for an ultra trail race later this year, which requires a lot of running and functional fitness. I’m generally a fan of anything to do with mountains and the sea, such as hiking, climbing, skiing, sailing, and surfing.\n\nAt least once a year I like to go on a proper adventure, camping out in some remote wilderness far from civilisation, swallowed up by the silence of mountains and the twinkling of stars. Though I occasionally crave the restorative benefits of escaping off-grid all on my own, most of the time I want to bring my woman along to experience the majesty. Hopefully you’re the kind of lady who loves the outdoors and doesn’t mind a little dirt under her finger nails.\n\nWhen it comes to sustenance, I’m a discerning omnivore. I enjoy cooking and I love trying out new restaurants. On a Sunday morning, I’ll walk the extra mile for specialist coffee or an artisanal bakery. However, as much as I love the finer things in life, I’m also happy to have a relaxing evening and order takeaway (but please read the most recent reviews, just to be sure!).\n\nI drink alcohol in moderation, and often go dry for weeks at a time. I don’t smoke or take drugs. I’d like to keep my mental and physical faculties sharp for many decades to come, and if we’re to grow old together, it’s important to me that you also look after your body and mind.\n\nMy friends and I often get together and host impromptu musical jam sessions. We play, sing, dance, chat, and party like this most weekends. It’s a blast and one of the most amazing ways of kicking off steam. Sometimes our jams attract more than 30 people — all levels welcome! The friendships forged over the years at these gatherings have led me to various spinoff hobbies and pursuits, including freediving, motorcycle trips, and launching a business.\n\nIntegrity, intellect, calm, discipline, kindness, generosity, adventure. These are the qualities I have to offer. But you’re likely to also encounter judgment, doubt, and withdrawal. That is how I'll react when you let me down. I experience disappointment viscerally, and my instinct is to pull away, creating distance. Softening into faith and forgiveness instead of descending into doubt — that’s The Work for me. But the silver lining is this: as much as I can dish out the tough love, I’m also good at receiving it without defensiveness or deflection. You can be radically honest with me, and I will listen attentively, seek to understand your perspective, and appreciate you for having the courage to speak your mind.\n\nI'm turned on by women who are fully, unapologetically themselves. Those who have the courage to drop carefully maintained facades in favour of a disarming realness. Those who, while working to be more loving and compassionate, also honour and acknowledge their Shadow. I want to know both the saint and the sinner within. A woman who shows up fully is willing to challenge taboos, confess her deepest desires to her partner, and expand emotional and intimate boundaries. By maintaining a non-judgmental space where no topic or question is off limits we allow our lover to open the kimono all the way - physically, psychologically and spiritually.\n\nA marriage will lose its spark unless we find ways of continuously surprising each other and ourselves. The juicy bits are hiding in the shadows, and it is our sacred practice to bring those aspects into the light and own them.\n\nI don’t expect you to tick all of these, but they’ll give you an idea of the qualities that would make me jump in with both feet.\n\nIf you found your way to this page through some algorithm and don’t have my contact details, you can send me an email .

      "fullText": "Friday, September 19, 2025\n\nHello 👋 I’m Yash. I live in San Francisco, California. Although this page may suggest otherwise, I’m not super tech bro-y. I spend a good amount of time in front of screens, yet I’m quite technologically challenged. This is a running doc on my personality as well as what I’m looking for in a partner.\n\nPreface: I don’t have a laundry list of filters. I’m not perfect, and I don’t expect my partner to be either. Importantly, I don’t look for finished products.\n\nIndia, 1998. Born to Hindi, forced to English. To echo words of Naval Ravikant , I have a calm mind, am working toward a fit body, and am looking for a house full of love. Strictly monogamous. Have an older sister. Parents back in India.\n\nI’ve moved a lot since covid, almost too much to the point that it’s exhausting to even think about packing suitcases. Grateful for all experiences. I’ve spent my formative years outside India and have been away from home for 12 years. I’m currently a software engineer.\n\nI’m not a transactional person. It irks me when people give depending on what they’ve received in the past, in any relationship, not just romantic ones. I keep my friend circle small, and I’m happy to do things by myself - I don’t want superficial connections. I am routinely alone, and I’m generally secure about this, although I have some off days too.\n\nI don’t like labels because I believe everyone’s on some sort of spectrum. I don’t know my MBTI, but I am more on the introverted side. It takes me a bit to open up and be vulnerable. I am obviously batshit crazy and act possessed around people I trust.\n\nI grew up as a vegetarian. In meats, I only eat chicken (and sometimes salmon). I don’t care if you eat/cook whatever, but of course it would be lovely to be able to share most of our meals. I also love cooking for others when I’m in the mood.\n\nHomebody at heart but try my best to not miss a sunny day. Like to try any and all sports.\n\nNorth star: I want to be proud of myself when I’m 80. Actively working on being more present. At any given moment, I’m usually chipping away at my doc on life goals. Mostly just vibing though.\n\nSomeone who hyperfixates on the positives. Spending years together is not going to be easy if we can’t look past the trivial/unimportant. I default to seeing the good in people way before their flaws, and I’d like to be with someone who leans the same way.\n\nPatience. One of my favorite quotes from A Gentleman in Moscow:\n\nBy their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration – and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.\n\nIn for the long haul and I’m happy to take things slowly. That said, patience also doesn’t mean bottling up feelings until a vague notion of “enough time” has passed. If I like you, I’ll try my best to communicate it.\n\nNon-judgemental. My best friendships are with people who are kind in their hearts and deeply care about understanding each other.\n\nA partnership full of growth. Someone who supports the other person thru the ups and downs, someone soft and candid. We laugh easily and tease each other. Good chemistry and intimacy. No topic is off the table and no walking on egg shells.\n\nIf you’re Indian, I’d love to be able to speak Hindi with you, although it’s not a must-have. I am also typically more attracted to Indians who grew up in India - easier to connect.\n\nA beautiful smile.\n\nIf you play games (think tiktoks on loyalty tests etc). No time for those. If I can avoid it, I don’t want anyone to have to second-guess what I’m thinking or wait ages for a response from me.\n\nIf you treat me like an option, I’m out. I naturally focus on one person at a time, even early on. It’s ok if you aren’t the same (you’re a queen - I’m sure you have options), but after a few dates, I expect honesty about whether you see something here. Please don’t keep me around as a backup - be kind.\n\nA political activist. I don’t want to talk politics day in day out. To me, politics is mentally and emotional draining with no clear benefit.\n\nDrugs or substance addiction. I drink occasionally and I don’t smoke. I strongly prefer non-smokers, but I’m ok as long as you don’t stink and are healthy.\n\n-\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you :) Again, anything mentioned above is a nice-to-have. I am hopelessly optimistic in people, for better or for worse. I know it can be scary to reach out, but I promise I’ll be nice to you. Please email me at yashmittal2009 [at] gmail [dot] com .\n\nDate Me"

He genuinely wants to be there for other people. I’ve seen him show so much openness to emotional connection in times when even other resilient and emotionally mature people would have been inclined to take a step back from their existing relationships. I’ve never seen stonewalling or apathy from him. Quinn always cares, and is excited to show that he cares. If you have the same love languages as Quinn, he’ll be able to make you feel super special. Being there for other people and caring doesn’t just mean caring about his friends or partners—he also shows up for communities. At a party, he’s either the host or the guy you assume is the host because he introduces a new burst of energy to each room he’s in.\n\nQuinn also has a super strong sense of self; he won’t passively fall into trends. I’ve never heard him be insincere or mocking. When so much media and so many conversations contain at least a little bit, and sometimes a lot, of mockery, Quinn has a refreshingly firm focus on topics where he can be completely sincere. Basically, it feels like the idiom “big-hearted” was invented to describe Quinn.\n\nSincerity : Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness.\n\nAnalyticalness : My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that.\n\nConviction : Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean loyalty to convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments.\n\nCompassion : I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others.\n\nAmbition : I want to be with goal-directed people.\n\nIntrospectiveness : There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up.\n\nAn ex once reported that I'm \"really gung ho about the mortifying ordeal of being known\".\n\nI've been known to run taco nights at my house.\n\nSwam from alcatraz to SF.\n\nReally psyched about work, generally enjoy being someone who works a lot. Ask me about my subsubfield of preventing AI from causing my death.\n\nAsk me about my subsubfield of preventing AI from causing my death.\n\nAlmost entirely vegetarian.\n\nBaby fever, but don't do a lot of thinking about my parenting values because I'd rather do that thinking as a group project with a special someone.\n\nOften singing and humming, hopefully a turning a loved one's name into song.\n\nI have at least two mysterious backstories.\n\nYes the kidney tshirt is real.\n\nOne secret zest for life / high hedonic setpoint trait/behavior that it'd be more fun to surprise you with.\n\nFic/media: mostly scifi and fantasy. Music: metal, prog, jazz.

If I could create a clone of myself, my clone would spend all her days picking up new skills, reading (currently reading The Marvelous Clouds), and writing . I'm currently pretty fascinated by business and comedy.\n\nI like doing things that actively engage and energize me, or show me something new, like: reading in a park on a sunny day, watching a movie that I can discuss with people, cooking, learning dance choreo, or exploring a new neighborhood. I also enjoy my guilty pleasures: holiday movies on Netflix (lol) and iced lattes.\n\nI love my daily/weekly habits and I like to renew my mind, body, and soul regularly.\n\nI like to be challenged by travel: I want to live like the locals do, experience a radically different culture, and go on spontaneous excursions (but also I have nothing against beach vacays). I also just enjoy simple outings in new surroundings, like a local neighborhood I haven't seen yet.\n\nI love expressing myself through my style, and I think it's fun to develop my taste and aesthetics."

      "fullText": "6/2/2024\n\n60 Comments\n\nDillon Paul\n\nJune 2024\n\nAll\n\nRSS Feed\n\nBlog\n\nAbout\n\nContact\n\nDo you keep your bank account in the black? Yes. What’s your attitude about debt? Fine. I have it on the house with a like 2.?? Interest. Are you okay if your partner wants to handle their money completely differently? I think so. It is hers. I have been in a position to give advice when desired, which has been the case for two girlfriends. Will you be transparent in allowing your spouse to know your finances and will they be transparent with you? I will and hope they will too. Will you combine money or keep separate accounts, each contributing to the household? I’m probably more inclined to keep separate accounts and suspect I will be the primary contributor of household expenses because of my wealth as that seems to have been the case in all my past relationships as there has always been a fairly large wealth disparity. I do plan on using a prenuptial agreement..\n\nSex. What are your sexual preferences? Are you mostly vanilla or do you like a lot of sprinkles and syrups? Fairly vanilla, but happy to accommodate to the preferences of my partner. What type of sexual relationship do you envision as ideal? Communication about our sexual desires, preferences, and frequency with willingness to collaborate to optimize for both of us. Do you have the maturity to be okay on those days, weeks or months your spouse doesn’t feel like it? Yeah. Easy for me. I have handled it myself most of my life. Can you be flexible over the lifespan as sexual interest ebbs and flows? Absolutely. Would you seek medical treatment and potentially take medications or undergo procedures if something physical came up that affect being sexual? Sure. No problem.\n\nBio family. If you marry, would your partner put you first, over their extended family members? Absolutely. Does their family practice appropriate boundaries and mind their own business? I think so. Would they be supportive of your relationship? Yes. What are your biological family’s expectations of you as a couple? We make our own rules and they would prefer to stay out of most of it. Are you willing to set firm boundaries with them if necessary? Sure.\n\nCareer. Will one or both of you have a career? Have you discussed career goals? I want to work to expand. Will you stay in balance with your work, avoiding workaholism? I’ll try my best. I may need my partner's help setting boundaries, however I've deprioritized most work until I find a partner, so dating, relationships, etc is where most of my time and energy go. Do you believe one person’s career is more important than the other? No. If one of you wants to quit work, to raise kids, go to school, take a break, would you be willing to support them? I think so. If you have children and must take them to the doctor, who will leave work to do so? I currently don’t have work, but figured we might have nannies as well. Who will take the day off to nurse a sick child? Flexible schedule now, so I can probably do it most of the time.\n\nWork ethic. If your family requires a two-person income to live a solid middle class lifestyle, are you willing to pull your weight to make it happen? Sure, but probably not needed. If either one of you lose your job, will you find something, anything, to help until you can find something new? Again, probably a non-issue.\n\nTidiness. Is one of you obsessive about cleanliness and everything having a place? Not me. Will you be able to lovingly live with a partner who is not that way? Would you inflict your tidy and cleanliness needs on them? If you are messy, are you willing to be more mindful of how that affects others? I have a tendency to messiness and disorganization and happy to get maids and do my best to contain myself.\n\nHolidays. Some people have strong family traditions. Would you be willing to spend every major holiday with either you or your partner’s family? I think I’m flexible. Only one partner through the holidays and she would spend it with mine most of the time, but I do whatever my partner tells me. Would you be willing to take turns, or would you prefer to have your own holiday, just the two of you? I’m fine with whatever, although I’ve never done an own holiday with a partner. What kind of birthday, holiday traditions are important to you? Thanksgiving and Christmas I typically do with my family. Are there any holiday or birthday traditions you reject? I don’t think so, although I don't usually celebrate birthdays or holidays on my own accord.\n\nSpiritual practice. Religious beliefs are highly personal. Does either one of you have a strong spiritual or religious stance? I am non-spiritual and agnostic and prefer to avoid religion or any investment in the metaphysical. Is it important for your spouse to practice the way you do? I have never been in a relationship with someone especially religious but I’d be open to it. Would you want to raise children in your religion? I’d defer to my wife’s wishes on this, but prefer to have to participate as little as possible. Is it okay with you if you practice religion or spirituality while your spouse does not? I’d prefer I’m not made to, but have accommodated girlfriends for special occasions like visiting one of their grandmothers and such.\n\nPets. Does one of you have, or want to have, pets? Anyone allergic to pets? Myself and my parents are allergic to cats and siblings and parents have always had dogs. I've never bothered with having a pet, but helped my one girlfriend who did have one. Are you both okay with having indoor pets? That’s fine. Would you let your pet sleep in your bed? I think so, as long as it doesn’t disturb my sleep too much. Do you believe in responsible pet ownership that includes medical care and not surrendering your animal for any reason? I believe in responsible medical care. I'm not sure what is meant by not surrendering your animal. My mother typically euthanized our dogs when practical to do so because of underlying illness if that's what is meant and got rid of her dog when I was born as it seemed to be unsafe around me. My mom was also very upset at my step grandmother whose dog bit my sister's face and blamed my sister for it. If you have pets, who will feed and take care of them? I’ll try to help like I did with my second girlfriend.\n\nPolitics. The nation has become viciously divided, and so have many couples and families who have different views on political issues. Do you have similar or opposing beliefs? I come from a progressive/liberal/democratic family and I'm the least political in my family by far. Do you require a potential partner to have the same political beliefs as you? No. Can you be fine with a partner who dislikes almost everything you believe in? I haven’t had to deal with that before, but my first girlfriends dad was a chiropractor and so she believed heavily on a pseudoscience called muscle testing and organized her food and water consumption in a very regimented fashion around it. She also had some views that considered anti-scientific such as vaccine skepticism. I would prefer partners who don't hold these anti-scientific beliefs, but I can deal with them as demonstrated in that past relationship. Definitely like to know the deal upfront though.\n\nSports. Does one of you like to watch or play sports anytime you can, including golf, football, tennis, soccer, hunting, fishing, etc. I do love to workout and/or play sports everyday. Do you believe you are balanced in your love of participating in or watching sports? I have become imbalanced in the past but think I have learned to become more balanced in relationships with time. If you are obsessed with watching or participating in sports, is your partner okay with that? Are you willing to compromise? I believe I am pretty good at compromising now.\n\nFirearms. What are your beliefs about firearms? Don’t think they are necessary. Would you have firearms in your home? Prefer not to, but my first girlfriend got a gun for her personal protection. Would they be loaded? I think hers was loaded. What safety precautions would you take? I think she left on the safety. Hopefully it’s locked if we had kids.\n\nMusic. Do you share similar taste in music? Would you insist on playing your music even if your spouse abhors it? What kind of music drives you crazy? Can you find music that both of you enjoy? Hasn’t been an issue yet. I don’t love some of my mom’s music and I deal with it.\n\nHealth. Do you believe in taking care of yourself? Yes. Do you do it? Yes. Do you get regular health maintenance like checkups, dentist visits, vaccinations? Most of the time. Do you care if your spouse does? I prefer she did. Do you think exercise and weight management is important? Yes. If you experience health problems would you do all you can to resolve them? Yes.\n\nAlcohol. Do you drink? Not really. If you do, do you do it in balance? Do you care if your partner drinks? No. If drinking becomes a problem in your life, would you get help? Yes, but I have never had issues with addiction.\n\nBirth Control. Do you believe both partners are responsible for birth control? Yes. As a spouse, would you be willing to use birth control? Yes. If you decide to not have any more children, would either of you be willing to take permanent measures to end fertility? Yes.\n\nBoundaries with exes. Do you believe it is okay to remain friends with ex and sometimes do things together? I have remained friendly with two ex-gfs, but we never do anything other than text or chat occasionally. I feel like I’m good with boundaries and trust worthy if I did do anything with them. Trust my partner to make the right decision for themself.\n\nCrazy exes. Crazy vindictive exes exist and can bring down a relationship that otherwise would have flourished. If your potential partner is constantly going back to court to battle and their former love enjoys making life miserable for them, you might think twice before signing up. I have one crazy ex-gf. We rarely communicate anymore.\n\nSaving. Do you believe in setting a certain amount of money aside for retirement? Yes Do you have a plan for that? Yes. Are you okay if you want to save and your spouse does not? I’d prefer a spouse that likes to save as well.\n\nWorry, anxiety and mental health. One of the biggest shocks I’ve experienced as a therapist is seeing how nervous, fearful, anxious, phobic, or paranoid so many people are. The constant obsessive thinking drains energy, breaks down health, and relationships. These things are highly fixable with trauma therapy and sometimes, medications. If you have this issue, would you be willing to do everything in your power to overcome it? Yes, I’ve had to overcome this thing before during acute stressors and developed many tools including medication.\n\nPersonality. One of the few things in life that can’t be changed. If you don’t like characteristics of your partner’s personality, decide if they are deal breakers. I am extroverted and a walking exclamation mark, my husband is introverted and loves quiet, and it works, mainly because he is incredibly accepting and tolerant. Can you be tolerant of your partner’s personality differences, or do you want them to be like you, or different than they are? Can you accept them as is, without hope for change? I’ve had partners that have difficulty accepting my ADD and some with difficulty with my obsessive compulsive personality traits around saving and frugality, but I’ve also learned how to become more flexible and communicate better with time.\n\nGrowth and evolution. The world is full of seekers and non-seekers. Which one are you? Some people are endlessly curious and love learning, growing, and being better. This is me. Others are fine with how they are. I have had numerous conversations with distraught spouses married to people who care nothing about evolving. Would this be important to you? I love evolving and I don’t think I’ve dated anyone who does like the same.\n\nEating out. Some people want to eat out almost every meal, and sometimes this means fast food. Is that okay with you? I rarely eat out, but would be open to it. What kind of meal traditions are important to you? None. Do you care about healthy nutrition? Healthy diet is important to me. Is it okay with you if your spouse does not? I’d prefer a spouse that cares about health. Never dated anyone who doesn’t care. Probably wouldn’t\n\nFood. What kinds of foods would you want to keep around the house? Who will be responsible for grocery shopping and cooking? You probably wouldn’t want to eat most of the food I make, but you’re certainly welcome to. Not a fan of grocery shopping for others, but I’ll do it.\n\nTV habits. In the age of streaming, enticing television is always available, and it can become addicting. Do you love to spend most free time, in the evening after work, watching TV? I try to avoid TV. Do you think television is a waste of time and should be minimized? Yes, I think TV is a waste of time and should be minimized. Would you like a TV-free household? I just don’t like a TV on frequently because I find it very distracting. If you do enjoy watching TV together, does that count as quality time? Yeah, that counts. Are you comfortable with your partner watching TV and knitting, painting, or playing on their phone or tablet? Preferably with ear buds, because as previously mentioned, I find it distracting.\n\nPhones, tablets, video games. Is your partner in love with their electronic devices? I spend a lot of time on my computer and phone, but try to respect people by putting it away when quality time is being had. Are you comfortable with the amount of time they spend on these plug-in time consumers? It’s not fair to get married to someone who has a phone glued to their hand and ask them to put it down so you can be comfortable. Work it out prior to marriage. I’ll probably need to learn when it needs to be put away.\n\nRetirement plans. A lot of people I know did not plan for the future and regret it today. If you want to have an adult marriage, you will both want to dedicate yourselves to putting back enough for your senior years. Don’t count on working until you die or inheriting a chunk from Grandmother. Live your lives as if your financial future depends on you, because often, it will.\n\nEmotional maturity. This is a biggie. One of the most common characteristics of emotional immaturity is blaming other people for your unhappiness. Short of things like getting punched in the nose unprovoked, blaming others for your plight in life is highly inappropriate. You are responsible for you and your happiness. People who are mature control and edit themselves and accept responsibility for how they feel. Adults are willing to delay gratification for a higher reward. They are respectful and conduct themselves in a way that’s conducive to getting along with people. They are solid and grounded. For me, this is a requirement to sign up for a lifetime with someone.\n\nAttachment style. It’s important to know your and your partner’s attachment styles, and to decide whether you are comfortable with them. If not, you have the option to work for change, but it’s a tough journey. Here’s what they are: 1. Avoidant — Keeps people at arm’s length. Often emotionally unavailable. Too much closeness and they pull away while complaining of feeling smothered. 2. Anxious. Anxiety-filled and desperately seek closeness. May feel insecure and need regular reassurance and contact. When paired with an avoidant, they play a game of trying to pull their love closer, only to find they stay for a moment, and pull away. 3. Secure attached. The healthiest attachment style, the secure attached person can give their partner all the space they need or come close, whatever is called for. 4. Disorganized. Unpredictable and volatile in relationships, experience feelings of both avoidant and anxious attachment. If it was me, I would always choose a secure attached partner. I have some secure and some avoidant tendencies.\n\nTemperament. Oh, the misery a moody person brings to another. A bad mood can ruin precious moments, and the sad thing is, it’s controllable. Are you and your partner capable of controlling your moods? If not, would you go to a physician and therapist to sort it out? It is each person’s responsibility to bring their best self to the marriage. Most partners would probably describe me as stable, although I have had some instability in times of significant career stress.\n\nSleep and energy levels. I was raised in a family where sleep was a precious thing, and it was always to be respected. If someone was tired, let them sleep. Other families are more regimented and perceive that sleeping late in the morning and taking naps is a sign of laziness and time-wasting. I personally disagree with this. What are your views on sleeping? Can you get up at the break of dawn and allow your spouse to sleep if they need with no negative repercussions? The healthy stance is to let people be who they are, practice self-care as they need, and to not control or judge them. When it comes to having enough energy to make it through a day, good sleep hygiene, nutrition, being mentally and emotionally healthy are all part of what creates it. Are you willing to arrange your life so that you have as much energy as you need to work and participate in family relationships? I’m a night owl and can get on weird sleep routines.\n\nExpectations. Many of my clients expect certain things and raise hell when disappointed. It is not appropriate for any adult to have expectations of another without the other person’s agreement. It’s important for a couple to negotiate expectations in the marriage. You will find many subjects to address as far as that goes right here on this list. Go over it, and mutually agree on what you can. You may not get everything you desire, and if you don’t, you must take care yourself as you would a child who is let down.\n\nLoyalty. Potentially more important than anything else on this list, do you have one another’s back? If someone speaks ill of your love, will you correct them? Will you protect them from your family if your family steps on toes? Will you drop what you’re doing to be there for them if something major befalls? This is one of the biggest bond builders, and knowing your love is solidly in your corner come what may is one of the best feelings there is. Make sure your partner has it. I think I’m good on this in relationships and have some ex-es that can vouch for this.\n\nFriendship. Would you still want to know and be close friends with your partner if they were a different gender? If your attraction is mainly physical, you’re putting your eggs in the wrong basket. It is friendship and the enjoyment of each other’s company that will carry you through to the finish line. All we need is a fondness that feels comfortable, warm, and fuzzy, that no one else but your partner can provide.\n\nPower differentials. Age, beauty, money, education, culture, religion, social background … all these dynamics have power. Marriage therapists know that the wider apart a couple is in power differentials, the more likely the relationship will falter. For example, you are young, they are old; you come from money, they’ve always been poor. You are beautiful, them not so much. He has a doctorate; you have a GED. You are Asian, they are African American. Any sort of discrepancies, differences in each person, will weigh against the relationship over the long term. Not always or in every case, but it should be considered.\n\nWork of marriage. Most people have heard that marriage is work, but they don’t know what that means. It means time, thoughtfulness, self-control, and sacrifice. The book The Five Love Languages (2) is the best book to explain what this means. Physical touch, words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, and gifts. Find out your partner’s love languages and practice them daily. Yes, I said daily. I struggled with this in my first couple relationships. Because of my ADD and OCPD I can get hyperfixated and neglectful, but I respond well to to feedback from my partner and have learned to communicate this.\n\nSensibilities. Some people are picky and bothered by a lot of things, and others are extremely tolerant of people and their environment. Which do you think is easiest to live with? I think I’m quite tolerant.\n\nSocial media. I can’t tell you how many clients complain about their spouse being addicted to their phone, tablet, and social media. And the video games! The question is, how much does your partner do it, and are they able to set these things aside and be there when you need them? If it’s a problem now, I’d take whether they are the person for you under serious consideration.\n\nDebt. My husband teasingly causes Amazon deliveries bankruptcy boxes. That’s funny, but credit cards and financial infidelity are a tremendous issue in marriages, and whether you plan to share cards or have one of your own, will you be transparent with how much unsecured debt you carry? Some spouses want zero credit card debt, would you be on board with that? What’s your philosophy of spending now, paying later? I try to always pay of my balance. I couldn’t handle a spouse who didn’t have decent saving and personal finance capabilities.\n\nVacations. Yes, some couples argue about vacations. Whether to take them, when to take them, how frugal, how fancy? Beach? Snow? The Grand Canyon? Burning Man? Others are homebodies and would prefer never to travel at all. Does your partner have any fears or phobias that prevent them from wanting to travel? What are your ideas and dreams about how family vacation time should be spent? I’m a home body and not in to fancy things, but I am happy to accommodate my partners wishes as well and find a balance. I’m also open to my partner traveling without me as they desire.\n\nVax or no vax? This may have to do with politics, but I have seen a couple who separated because one spouse wouldn’t wear a mask or get vaccinated during the pandemic, and the wife found it so disrespectful that she kicked her husband out. How would you handle such a situation? If you are against vaccinations, can you accept your spouse having a different opinion? Can you respect your partner’s decisions when they are different from yours? I have trouble with people that are in to conspiracy theories and anti-science. With that said, I almost married one and I found ways to deal with it. But I would love to find someone with normal critical reasoning and appropriate trust in science.\n\nFighting style. Criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling are predictors of divorce. In marriages that happily last the long term, the couples tend to laugh things off. Most couples I see are in the first category. I teach couples daily how to settle arguments calmly and respectfully, and how to get to the point where they can laugh things off. It’s a learned skill and you must pay a trauma therapist to teach you how. Knowing what I know, I would insist on that. I think I am pretty good at this stuff.\n\nBoundaries. Adults have free will to live as they choose, and no one has the right to control them. That’s why I want you to understand that your marriage partner comes, as is. Marriage will involve negotiation, compromise, and sometimes sacrifice. If you have met someone who is controlling and have to have things a certain way, then you need to think long and hard about how that’s going to feel day after day, year after year. We all have the right to make reasonable and respectful requests of our spouses, but they have the right to say no. Also, boundaries include restraining and editing yourself, with friends and family. Is your partner good at that? Do they hold things inside and resent? If so, think again, my friend. I work a lot on my emotional intelligence, regulation, and conflict resolution skills. Also, have addressed some of my OCPD that’s not ideal for relationships. I think I’m in a pretty good spot.\n\nDetailed written profile below pictures. @dwpaulDE (public) for more pictures.

      "fullText": "Hi, I’m Tanner — a curious, beard-bearing San Franciscan who loves laughter and adventure. Hoping more cute than cutting edge in a virtual “we bumped into each other in an electronic version of a cafe” sort of way. I laugh a lot, am usually dressed for an afternoon of relaxing and focus on goals and personal growth.\n\n<aside>\n\nMessage me your favorite fun fact and let’s compare notes\n\nor [email protected]\n\n</aside>\n\nHave you ever thought “I wish I could find a man with a great beard who makes me laugh, is emotionally self aware, resilient, knows how to communicate, has a zest for life and adventure then very conveniently lives in a delightful neighborhood that’s iconic of San Francisco” Just your luck - it’s me!\n\nAlways laughing and having a hearty time. I’ve been described as the connective, gooey tissue that brings people together (thanks?). Carrying a camera (sometimes film) to document my life and occasionally bumping into friends along the way. Continuously discovering and rabbit holing from urban planning’s effect on social interaction and familial development to Arabian pirates of the 17th century.\n\nWhat I’m into:\n\nI’m thankful to have a prosperous career in tech making a positive impact of people’s lives while setting myself and my family for long term success. I care deeply about the direct my moral compass points aiming to do the most good for people possible. Currently I’m at Vercel, doing just that, on Brand Marketing with a crew of adventurous and humble folks.\n\nThe full history is at my LinkedIn should you care to indulge.\n\n⭐ Jack “Convivial with refined tastes, strong loyalty, and great taste in memes”\n\n⭐ Tymn “He can’t be described in one sentence”\n\n⭐ Ala \"He's a sincerely nice guy, very social, who loves travel, metal music, and going down the rabbit hole on niche topics like cults and city planning.”\n\n⭐ Wheels “Tanner is like a cosmic gumbo. Smooth, nutritious, surprising, and a real treat.”\n\nAsk me about my cool friends\n\nName : Tanner Godarzi (you can also call me Tan)\n\nAge : 33\n\nLocation : San Francisco, CA 🌁\n\nBackground: Half Persian and the greatest hits of Europe mixed in with some Spanish zest\n\nPersonality type : Extroverted with friends, contemplative and meditative elsewhere\n\nWork: Currently at Vercel building vercel.com . Previously, Engineering for Brand and Marketing at Notion (how meta)\n\nMusical tastes? Anything poolside at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs to driving industrial beats like Nine Inch Nails, cinematic and expansive scores from Godspeed You! Black Emperor to nostalgic hipster indulgences in Arcade Fire.\n\nInfluences? Many, but I consider Anthony Bourdain, Trent Reznor and Alex Calderwood as my heroes well. I’m huge fans of my friends and draw inspiration from the community I live in.\n\nAll things media? I prefer my news to come from strange visions in my dreams sandwiched between Ken Layne of Desert Oracle and financial news from Bloomberg. Otherwise, occasional art house film or 4 hour Youtube explainer on a mundane topic.\n\nWhat else? A mystery to continuously unravel over a glass of wine\n\nI deeply value for myself and people I surround myself with a sense of community and curiosity about the world. Balancing sensitivity with durability. Finding moments of meditation for inner peace during the weird times we find ourselves in. Finding as much joy exploring far flung places like an out of the way cheese in Antibes as I would an unexpected run-in with a friend in the city.\n\nKindness carries the day. Let’s prove the doubters wrong.\n\nSomeone intrigued to make it this far! I’m looking for someone to go on coffee dates and my soulmate — is that too much to ask?\n\nConcretely, I’m interested in women in my age group (Millenials) in San Francisco. But don’t let that dissuade you! I’d love to hear from you if you’re outside The Bay or on the cusp of the generation. I’m interested in a long term relationship and infinitely excited about the idea of kids with someone who’s health forward, ambitious and caring.\n\nExploring The Bay through photo walks, new restaurants, and hikes\n\nStaying centered with meditation, yoga, and reading\n\nWriting short reflections (and sometimes long rabbit holes)\n\nSharing adventures outdoors with people who appreciate curiosity and play\n\nFilm camera photo walk through San Francisco\n\nA deep game of We Are Not Really Strangers\n\nWine bar hopping\n\nHaha, what if we spent a weekend in Palm Springs\n\n💘 Shoot Your Shot?\n\n💘  Shoot Your Shot?\n\n🤠 Dating Me Is Like\n\n🍟 What My Friends Would Say About Me\n\n🤔 Some Basics About Me\n\n⭐ My Values\n\n🔭 Who I’m Looking For\n\n💃🏻 Date Ideas\n\n🌐 Where I’m At On The Internet"

I live near Philadelphia, but am not settled yet.\n\nI center my life around close relationships and doing good for the world. My brain works in optimizey ways, but I also trust intuition, feel deeply, and love being playful.\n\nWhat’s noticeable about me in relationships is that I’m an intense person! I naturally go all in and move fast when aligned with something. I feel profoundly grateful to be alive, so I try to live with maximum agency.\n\nMy lifestyle is minimalist and utility based (though not robotic-y!), and this leads me to be very open-minded about how to get things done. I adore unconventional ideas (e.g. I sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor with no pillow), and highly value authenticity and creativity.\n\nUltimately, my favorite moments are the mundane moments just being present, especially with close friends. And I love when the people in my life balance me to be more spontaneous, accepting, and joyful for the sake of being joyful.\n\nI’m concerned about existential risks like climate change and potentially AI. I’m especially concerned the US is heading towards authoritarianism and won’t be able to address these problems. To help, I travel across the country to win key elections and protect democracy. I love my job, though it requires a nomadic lifestyle. I’d consider finding a different job to make logistics work with my life partner.\n\nWhen I’m not working, I spend time in nature (I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail three years ago!), talk with friends and build community, read , journal, and experiment with life!\n\nA transcendent kind of love. A best friend. Someone who feels warm and like home. I find my deepest friendships make me not fear death, so maybe something like that…\n\nOn a practical note, it’s challenging to know what makes people click! So err on the side of reaching out. :)\n\nLife’s short, please take the chance! I made this because I want to be contacted! Let’s set up a low-stakes phone call and see if we vibe. :)\n\nBounty : I’ll give $1,234 to the person who introduces me to my husband.\n\nBut- What if you’re my husband?\n\nhaha jk…\n\nabout me\n\nwhat i’m doing with my life\n\nwhat i’m looking for\n\nplease reach out!\n\ncurious, intense, playful, do-gooder\n\nsome logistics"

      "fullText": "Retired future poker player, current nomadic uncle, aspiring intentional live-r.\n\nIn an even earlier lifetime, I was a data scientist and quit my corporate job to play poker. But then, I realized all I did was swap my corporate treadmill for a competitive-gaming exercise bike, and that I hadn't actually solved the incongruence of driving to the gym and taking the elevator to get on an exercise machine to work off all the processed foods I stress ate. So now, I’m walking outside instead, constantly checking how much longer it’ll be until I’ve reached my step goal for the day.\n\n(To be clear, this is all strictly a metaphor. I've never actually been motivated to consistently go to the gym; I have a very high metabolism that tricked me into thinking I was healthy when I wasn't. Also, my metaphors may need work. Help me please?)\n\nName: George\n\nAge: 35\n\nHeight: 5’8\n\nLocation: Nomadic (with a temporary home base in the SF Bay Area)\n\nOccupation: Funemployed explorer (aka whatever I want)\n\nReligion: Agnostic but closer to spiritual\n\nI quit my corporate job in 2019 and spent the next few years studying (running programs / developing strategies / memorizing decision trees) and playing poker because I wanted to see how good I could be at something that more matched my skillsets. At the same time, after becoming aware to how much my achievement mindset had driven my life for so long and how I no longer wanted that, I’ve decided that poker will likely just be a way for me to offset costs going forward and not the primary focus of my life. So I've become interested in traveling (seeing the world, meeting cool people, having new experiences), and I was on an extended roadtrip for almost 2 years across the US (primarily through National Parks and secondarily through art museums—yes, my header picture is from Chihuli in Seattle). More recently, I was in Peru for a month and LOVED it, and I’m currently embarking on a Europe⇒Africa⇒SE Asia cruise.\n\nLonger term, I know that I'll likely want to be geographically flexible or nomadic. I'm not sure for how long I'll want to travel or if I eventually want to establish a more permanent home (forming a community of likeminded people does interest me intellectually). I'll very likely be interested in having children at some point, because I find children to be wonderful learning beings and I'd like to help with and be a part of that process, but as I've learned over the years, I never truly know what future George wants. No matter how convinced I am at any moment that past George was wrong but NOW present George is completely right, I know it's all a trick. I think.\n\nMore motivated by her own desires than those of other people and of society\n\nChaotic good: rules are only guidelines and I’d hope that kindness and care for other beings trumps all. But also, some such guidelines hopefully are more important than others (i.e. radical honesty with each other and with our children is near the top)\n\nAdventurous: more inspired by new experiences than by comfortable routines\n\nNeverending mutual teasing (including of ourselves). For example, my college application essay was about the tribulations of growing up short (I was robbed of a storied NBA career by these struggles)\n\nToni Stark (if she exists) is my ideal\n\nOpen to both monogamy and nonmonogamy: I’ve traditionally only been in monogamous romantic relationships but I’ve grown to appreciate the nonduality of relationships (i.e. a spectrum from acquaintances to more platonic friendships to primary life partner) and realize that our love isn’t finite. Ultimately, I do expect to be monogamish (if not monogamous), as my energy and interests tend to hyperfixate more than those of most polyamorous people do\n\nChildren: Yes please! And hopefully more than 1 (I was an only child)! I ultimately would like to be a stay-at-home parent and would be thrilled if my partner would want to as well, especially for the early years of the children’s lives\n\nPlatonic connections: open and excited about connecting with people even if it doesn’t lead to “my one true soulmate” (/whatever the nonmonogamous version of that is)\n\nVery ADHD conversations: as you can probably already tell by my liberal use of parentheses, I get distracted easily in my writing, and I can confirm that conversing with me is a similarly disjointed experience\n\nCuriosity and open-mindedness: relatedly, an understanding that the absence of evidence does not mean the evidence of absence\n\nAuthenticity and honesty (both with oneself and with other people)\n\nPlatinum Rule >>> Golden Rule: Treat others the way THEY would like to be treated. Abiding by the Golden Rule places your expectations onto other people, and that's a common source of conflict in society\n\nThe balance between self-acceptance and self-improvement\n\n🔍 About Me\n\n🕵️ What I Am Looking For\n\n💭 I Spend a Lot of Time Thinking About\n\nRelationship Goals:\n\nIdeal Partner:\n\nValues:"

      "fullText": "I am looking for someone to date and eventually marry!\n\nUltimately finding someone is very simple: It’s just about being mutually attracted and excited about the possibility of building a life together (though you can also reach out for a less intense relationship!). The core requirements for that are:\n\nI hope you can judge communication from my writings and the kinds of things I do; attraction from my pictures. The vibe has to be experienced but unlike pictures, that doesn’t scale. So this document tries to convey my vibe through an explanation of my values, my life, and some anecdotes.\n\n<aside>\n\nShow; don’t tell, as they say:\n\nI was born in Spain (Madrid) in 1992, then grew up in the Canary Islands to a height of 5’10’’. Eventually I went to college for too long, earning two masters degrees in mechanical engineering and aerospace dynamics.\n\nMy early career ambitions of doing actual rocket science got derailed by Life, and ended up in a series of jobs that started in the shop floor of an electric car company, an ended up in my current role as Head of Theory at Retro Biosciences. In between I worked at an AI startup that got acquired by Twitter and was offered a job to blog on the internet for 2 years by a bay area benefactor, which also got me my first O1 visa to come to the US. I’ve been a resident of San Francisco for 4 years and intend to continue residing in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis is indeed my official pic from work, see it at retro.bio/team\n\nTo some people I’m most known as the blogger behind nintil.com , where I’ve written about all sorts of things for over a decade, from the economic history of the USSR to Alzheimer’s Disease to technological progress and metascience to AI risk. If my current life arc goes well, my next proudest achievement will be to have made a meaningful dent on human aging.\n\nWhat makes a person them? One could gesture at memories, the way they look, the things they like. Maybe people don’t really exist, if one has ripped deep from the Parfitian bong. I find some truth to the idea that people are to some extent their values. I definitely think so for myself: I identify with my values, the most stable part of who I am. What do you care about? How do you behave in the world? Here are my own\n\nWe must be good communicators (Which in turn requires emotional competency, self-awareness, kindness, curiosity, and intelligence)\n\nWe must be mutually attracted (I’m straight)\n\nAnd we must vibe\n\nhttps://x.com/artirkel\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jlriconf\n\nhttps://nintil.com/ </aside>\n\nTruth-seeking: I want to understand the world and those around me, including myself. This is probably the first value I ever consciously endorsed. My first answer to “what is the point of it all” was this, perhaps oddly as many people tend to reach for ‘happiness’, ‘understanding’.\n\nHonesty and transparency: I really try to only speak truths and to not decline questions about myself, my motivations, or my thoughts (unless there are concerns about other people’s privacy, promises I’ve made, NDAs, etc). I once stood in front of an audience exposed to arbitrary questions about what most would consider very personal matters and I answered them all.\n\nReliability: I do what I say. I keep my promises, am not late to things. I keep most of my tasks in my calendar and have good awareness of what’s happening and what has to happen next.\n\nIntegrity: I strive to be consistent in my actions across contexts. No matter what I’m doing, the same principles apply. If I’m being hypocritical I appreciate if I’m called out on it so I can be better aligned with what deep down I value.\n\nSelf-improvement: Though I’m pretty great, I believe I can be even better and I appreciate when others help me, even when I don’t ask for it. Unsolicited advice is hereby declared solicited!\n\nBenevolent perspective: Sometimes people make other people feel bad for a variety of reasons. I think people are, deep down, good. When they are not, they are mistaken in some or another way. This leads me to react with curiosity, pity, and sadness (accordingly, case by case) instead of anger and hate. I don’t always act like this for I too am a fallible human but I try! This doesn’t mean I’m naive about people. Some people can’t be trusted, they say one thing and do anther or are manipulative!\n\nPolitics: though I don’t think about politics that much in my day to day life, the labels libertarian, classical libertarian, or even anarchist of some flavor would fit me; you can read more in my blog about my views.\n\nAbout me\n\nValues\n\nWhat my life looks like\n\nMe on the internet"

      "fullText": "date me!\n\nI’m 38, 5’8”, bi, and in pretty good physical shape (the best of my life!). I live in Brooklyn, NYC. I’m playful, reflective, and caring; I’m Uncle Hussein and godparent to two kids I love, I have an amazing cat, I do community work, etc; just a normal, stand-up guy with zero skeletons in the closet and absolutely no aspirations to start a personality cult or anything weird like that.\n\nOn bad days I think I’m a good person because I’m funny and clever. On good days I think I’m a good person because I’m open-hearted, playful, and kind. On the best days I don’t think about whether I’m a good person at all.\n\nI recently combined a list of goals and the things I like to do, and they seemed to fall into four values: connection, curiosity, beauty, and vitality.\n\nIf you are sick I will make soup and bring it to you. It’s an important way I show love.\n\nSome things I like to do:\n\nI worked in tech for 15+ years and one thing it is easy to do is separate oneself from people unlike you. To work and live and play in communities of people very similar to you, or to have the “diversity” you experience look like skin color and sexuality and gender id but not wealth or class or education. It is deeply, vitally important to me to not do this, to stay connected to and in touch and aware of the way others live. We may be better off but we are not better. I will not separate myself from humanity.\n\nMy vice is hookah. If I had one at home I’d instantly die of lung cancer, so I don’t. But I keep finding that the best people I know are down to go to a hookah bar. Doesn’t have to be you, but it’s an easy way to get a 🤩 face from me.\n\nI believe a life of weeping-with-happiness contentment is possible, and I want it. [Update: since writing that, I have wept with happiness.]\n\nI would like to co-create a life - location, partner, friends, community (which I see as another word for “family”) - at a more sustainable pace, where exploration and flourishing is nurtured. I value making sure people are fed: I’ve volunteered making meals for chronically sick people, and also helped run a mutual aid food drive for two years. I want to spend more of my time tackling food insecurity and I’ve got Big Plans to do so.\n\nI’ve still got more travelling in me: more time in Japan, interior China, a return to Istanbul, and Iran are all on my bucket list. I seem to be converging on India from both directions.\n\nSomeone giving me feedback on this page once told me I come across as having main character energy. It’s true! And I’m looking for a co-star: someone who burns brightly, knows it, and wants to be with me because they love my light; a relationship where we reinforce and lift each other, ever-growing.\n\nI think I’d make an amazing trophy husband, which is only a joke if you’re not rich.\n\nI want children, and I want to be active in raising them. I grew up in London and miss it enormously, but it’s not time for me to move back yet ; but I do think it’d be a wonderful place to live it’s time for me to trade my main character energy into being a supporting character in my kids’ lives. If we get serious, expect me to seriously float this idea. In the meantime, I’ll be back for regular visits: London is a place where I breathe out, find ease and peace.\n\nI used to be allergic to the word until a friend pointed out “dude, you have a spirit, it’s the thing that makes you you”, and then I was fine.\n\nThe condensed version of my spiritual biography: I grew up Muslim, but quit in my early twenties because I felt like I couldn’t do it well enough. I came close to falling down the New Atheism rabbithole, but dodged it; in my late twenties I began a quest for capital-M Meaning, which I finally found after lots of therapy and years of Zen practice.\n\nBuddhism has been important to me for approaching a decade. Buddhist philosophy and psychology is very much a part of who I am, how I think, and how I like to relate to the world. An example: when getting US citizenship, I asked for a waiver to the Oath of Allegiance on the grounds of not wanting to support the military, even though being 38 means there’s basically no chance I’ll get drafted.\n\nIt’s important to me that my partner has their own self-development practice - something that helps them be freer, kinder, and more open. It by no means has to be Buddhist flavoured.\n\nI’m happy to talk about any of these if you’d like to know more.\n\nThis is the end of the text-heavy part. Thank you for sticking around!\n\nThere are a few places you can go from here:\n\nThanks, and I hope you find what you’re looking for too. ❤\n\n[back to top]\n\nDance, in particular 5Rhythms (free movement / expressive / ecstatic dance);\n\nOutdoorsy / light-active stuff: climbing, walking, fair-weather sailing, easy cycling (no lycra);\n\nGrow food - I built raised beds in my garden, and love the fresh tomatoes I get from it;\n\nDIY and making stuff - I’ve made plenty of the things in my house, including furniture and drapery;\n\nCooking, restaurants, cocktails (though I rarely drink these days);\n\nAny classical music concert featuring an angsty Russian Romantic composer;\n\nI would like to have children (at least one), preferably biological.\n\nThe kind of relationship I want is rock-solid: lots of communication, exquisite attunement. I think such a relationship could unfold into something monogam ish : if there is nothing that can threaten the relationship, there’s room for fun and sparkles. But to say that the relationship needs to feel very secure first is an understatement; getting that right is the only priority.\n\nI pair better with someone who also has good executive function skills. Being able to trust a partner to get things done makes me feel taken care of, and gives me a profound feeling of relief and safety.\n\nI am politically far to the left. That said, I have largely disengaged with US politics and treat it solely as a spectacle. These days I am more of an anarchist, by which I mean I believe that community building and mutual aid is worthwhile and morally necessary.\n\nIf you think Israel’s occupation and treatment of Palestine is in any way conscionable or justifiable, I am not the person for you.\n\nI’m an only child, and have minimal to no contact with both of my parents. My family is thus entirely chosen. If you’re close to yours, I would love to become part of it.\n\nI have a (really, really, really amazing) cat . If you viscerally hate cats, or have overwhelming allergies, that’d make it hard.\n\nI am vegetarian, with very occasional and intentional exceptions. I don’t mind whether you are or not. I do enjoy cooking, and will want to cook for you, so if you’ll feel slighted by me not putting meat on your plate then… eh, I dunno.\n\nLook at pictures of my cat\n\nLook at an assortment of pictures and videos from my life\n\nIf you’re interested, or have something to say, email me: hello@thiswebsite\n\nhussein.love\n\nHi, I’m Hussein 👋\n\nThe sort of person I am\n\nThe sort of future I want\n\nSpirituality\n\nPotential dealbreakers\n\nWhat next?"

      "fullText": "Search\n\nBy Alex\n\nPublished on October 27 th , 2024\n\nMany people know me as TurnTrout , but you can call me “Alex.” I want to let you see a different facet of me than I usually present online.\n\nI was born in ’94. Now, I’m a research scientist on Google DeepMind’s scalable alignment team in San Francisco. In this document, I’ll overview what the intervening time has made of me, as a person.\n\nI’m hoping to meet a wonderful woman to be my best fr iend for many years. (And by “best friend”, I mean “wife.”)\n\nI’m kind, conscientious, and ready to admit mistakes—maybe I’m too ready, to be honest! Speaking of “honest”, I’m also an extremely honest person. I haven’t always lived as ethically or as honestly as I would now have preferred, and I’m surely going to make more mistakes, but god damn if I’m not going to live this one life well.\n\nI am pretty goofy if I trust and feel comfy around someone. I think I’d jive well with someone more spontaneous and daring, since I tend to be more planned and conservative. Well, I’m usually more conservative:\n\nIf I make a commitment to you, I keep it, and I’m not particularly afraid of commitments. I’m someone you can rely on. 1 One of my friends described me as “not the kind of person who will put up with [unethical] conspiracies.”\n\nOn the other hand, I do love a good ethical conspiracy. I once hatched an elaborate “welcome back” party for a partner who was coming back from overseas. I rounded up 18 of her friends and hid them in my apartment so they could all jump out at her.\n\nI’m hard-working. In 2017, in the second year of my computer science PhD, I found out about the AI alignment prob lem. However, I lacked the skills to contribute to this hilariously neglected super-problem. That lack didn’t really matter to me—I thought that the world needed something from me, and I wasn’t going to not even try .\n\nI might not be good at something at first, but I don’t quit! In the second year of my PhD I wasn’t comfortable proving mathematical theorems. By the end of my fourth year, I had proved 281 new theorems.\n\nThat said, I’ve become a bit less research-focused recently. Somewhat relatedly, I’d become somewhat more anxious than I’d like. At the end of 2023, I realized that I just… wasn’t enjoying my life? Since then, I’ve focused on meditation, intentionality, gratitude, and actually taking breaks.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wasn’t social. These days, I love meeting new people! I’m an ambivert : sometimes socializing is energizing, but sometimes it’s draining. I have a lot of friends who are precious to me, and I wish I could give each of them the time they each deserve. Sometimes I even look out over a city and wonder at the residents:\n\nSo, I care a lot about people—both in the abstract and personally. I’ve never yelled at anyone in my life (except, you know, I probably did as a young kid, but I don’t remember that well).  I’m also a vegan who cares about animals.\n\nI like doing a lot of things!\n\nI probably (70%) will want kids within the next 5 years.\n\nI’ve historically been polyamorous but I’m open to monogamy. I find it natural to form romantic attachments with multiple people and am not very jealous. I talk regularly with my former partner Emma—I want my friendship with her to stay strong.\n\nI currently live in Berkeley. I’m open to (but disprefer) a long-distance relationship if there’s a good chance we end up in the same location, assuming the relationship is great! In particular, cities like New York and London are more workable (as DeepMind has offices there I could work out of).\n\nThis isn’t a list of demands or anything, just ingredients for a good relationship with me:\n\nIf this sounds like a nice potential connection, I’d love to:\n\nOK, I’ve written enough! Get to know me if you want to know more.\n\nI mean, I’m not perfectly reliable. I’m just a hum—I mean, I’m just a trout! For example, there recently was a situation where I may have simply forgotten what someone had requested two years prior. But I think I am overall highly reliable—both in terms of faithfulness and in terms of logistics. ⤴\n\nAka , ethical in the “I’ll actually stand up in real life” way and not just ethical in the “I’ll talk for hours about the nature of goodness” way. ⤴\n\nAbout me\n\nMy research\n\nAll posts\n\nOpen source\n\nSubscribe\n\nAbout me Professional life Personal life\n\nProfessional life\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhat I like doing\n\nHow compatible are we?

When my friends self-deprecate, I often scold them for insulting my friend (i.e. themselves).\n\nAs of November 2024, my attachment s tyle leans “anxious-preoccupied.” However, over the past few years, my style was “secure.” I find it easy to date anxious folks because I like supporting my partners through reassurance and praise.\n\nMy love lang uage is “quality time” and “physical touch”, closely followed by “words of affirmation.” I want to find a life partner —a mutually supportive and committed relationship.

      "fullText": "Want to date Nate?\n\nHi, I’m Nathan, but you can just call me Nate. I’m a 28-year-old male Machine Learning Engineer living in Rhode Island and I’m looking for a long-term relationship.\n\nI’m a straight, nerdy guy and I love to spend my weekend working out, attending local live music events, or hanging out with friends or family.\n\nThough I’m a bit introverted at first, once I feel comfortable, I open up and enjoy good conversations. I love traveling, learning about history and culture, reading Japanese comics, and fitness.  I’m currently learning Japanese in my free time and am close to reaching a 1,000-day streak on Duolingo.\n\nMy life philosophy is to live peacefully and happily while minimizing the suffering of others. I enjoy nerd culture and memes but I dislike jump-scare horror movies, bad/lazy storytelling, materialistic individuals, and “grind culture”.\n\nI grew up in Pawtucket, Rhode Island with a family of interesting characters. I was a bit of a black sheep growing up but I’m still close with my family. My family deeply values their Ghanaian culture, and I’ve learned to appreciate it over the years. Although I didn’t grow up speaking Twi, Ghana’s native language, I’ve picked up bits and pieces, and love how the language carries pieces of the culture. My friends and family describe me as Blunt, Straightforward, Loyal, and Practical.\n\nGolden Hour while halfway up Mt. Inari in Kyoto, my favorite city in the world.\n\nIn the cockpit of a World War 1-era plane at the Great War Flying Museum near Toronto.\n\nSelfie with one of the super-friendly deers of Nara, Japan.\n\nI truly felt at peace while solo traveling through Japan\n\nWorking out is my favorite pastime. It helps relax me and I love the process of improving myself.\n\nI’m looking for a woman interested in a long-term monogamous relationship. We’d be a good match if you:\n\nI’m looking for a “power couple” dynamic, where we are both able to stand on our own but are even better together and can catch each other when one of us slips. Open to marriage and children in the future. In a few years, I’d love to have a condo outside of Boston- closer to my job but not too far away from friends and family in Rhode Island.\n\nIf you think we’ll get along I would love to hear from you! Contact me via email ( 1nate146@gmail.com ) or on Instagram (@natemen96) with a mention about the Date me doc!\n\nEnjoy anime or manga, love movies, or appreciate a good story.\n\nAre interested in Japanese culture, especially if you’re learning or know the Japanese language.\n\nLikes working out, especially weightlifting.\n\nValue your career and family.\n\nLove to travel and is okay with a partner who travels for work (you can travel with!).\n\nEnjoy a variety of music (rock, indie, rap, etc.).\n\nIntro\n\nSummary\n\nSome visuals\n\nWhat I’m looking for\n\nInterested?"

      "fullText": "Table of contents\n\nI decided to use one of the Engineering solution templates from Notion, so my problem is figuring out how to use this without making people think I need a group of overpaid college graduates to fix me.\n\nBut really, my goal is to find a loving, rewarding relationship with a female I am interested in and for whom I am willing to sacrifice the time necessary to build a relationship. Someone who is kind, intelligent, silly, curious, courageous, and empathetic. And very importantly, someone who is emotionally mature enough to realize the kind of work and sacrifices that a relationship entails.\n\nI am pretty flexible about the actual location, since my job is usually remote. Buttt I am a sucker for good weather - I’ve lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and in Malaga, Spain for a little bit so I am not going to pretend that living in Norway would be perfect for me. But love transcends all, right? 😛 I’ll try to use some of the existing fields in this template that I find are surprisingly appropriate or just funny.\n\nIdeally - find someone who is compatible with me in a relationship sense by showing them this document and some pictures of me, at which point they will fall hopelessly in love.\n\nMeeting more guys. Just kidding! If you think we would be two cubes in an ice tray, regardless of what your gender is, then totally message me and we can haaanggg. See “Implementation and Rollout Plan” for contact details.\n\nMeet a lot more girls with the openness to a relationship or just a friendship depending on how we feel about each other. I see either as a win, but I want to be clear that my intention going into a meeting is 80% to date and 20% to be friends. To be clear, I love having a relationship that has the foundation of a friendship. But I am not sure how this is possible unless we read this doc, signed a binding contract to be friends, erased our memories, and then one day felt that we could be more.\n\nI think it’s easier going from “Ah I don’t see this working out as a relationship, but we can totally drink boba like every 5 weeks” rather than “Hey we drink boba like every 5 weeks, but I want to see you again tomorrow.”\n\nProgramming - I am a software engineer who has worked for blockchain companies (trading and gaming-related) and I am extremely grateful that I truly enjoy my work! I love building things with an end customer in mind and I find it awesome that solving cool problems can make peoples’ lives better. Somehow, I think the universe was beautifully designed that way.\n\nMath/Physics I kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world I have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation I used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\n\nI kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world\n\nI have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation\n\nI used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\n\nStrategy Games Really Like Catan (I love the 1v1 version of Colonist, I was ranked Diamond two seasons ago and btw the username is from Looking for Alaska by John Green haha) Secret Hitler Soccer Love/Hate Chess Tennis (love watching it though) Hate Uno (is this even strategy?)

      "fullText": "For a lack of wisdom, statistics.\n\nI have two Neuroscience degrees (Caltech BA 2013, UC Berkeley Masters 2019). I have also worked as a\n        researcher and Data Scientist at Google Machine Intelligence, YouTube, and Verily Life Sciences. My research interests span medical imaging, neuroscience, machine intelligence, and Dharma science.\n\nAt Forest Neurotech, we are developing a device that can image and modulate functional activity\n                    in the human brain cheaply, portably, and minimally-invasively. \n                    We hope this technology will be used to treat a wide range of conditions from depression to addiction , \n                    as well as brain-machine interfacing \n                    and neuroscience research.\n\nWhile at Verily, I worked on the Virtual Stainer project. We used generative learning to predict histological stains from autofluorescence scans of unstained tissue. See (McNeil et al., 2024) , in Modern Pathology, and other publications.\n\nI worked on a project to use Masked-Siamese Networks to embed colonscopy videos in a semi-supervised way. See (Shor, McNeil et al., 2024)\n\nWhile at Berkeley, I was in the Gallant Lab within the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research org, working on fMRI research projects to model the human visual system.\n\nWhile at Google Machine Intelligence, I kicked off a collaboration between Google and Berkeley to study emotion in human faces using DNNs. 5 years later, this collaboration produced (Cowen et al. 2021) in Nature. I have an ongoing interest in emotion and mental health.\n\nWhile at Berkeley, I taught the course Drugs and the Brain under Prof. David Presti . At Caltech, I taught a class of the same name under Prof. Henry Lester . Psychedelics, as a therepeutic, spiritual, and investigative tool remain of interest to me.\n\nScienctific work is creative work. But I have also produced a lot of more casual content.\n\nI have several long-form talks on psycho-spiritual frameworks on my YouTube Channel . These were given at a private event, and due to popular acclaim, I posted them online. Perhaps more on this theme will follow.\n\nI write essays sometimes, which I post to my Substack . The topics range between philosophy, poetic, light research projects, and psychology. For example:\n\nPolyamory doesn't Liberate; Monogamy doesn't Protect by Carson\n\nReflections and community quotes from a decade in the Bay Area dating landscape.\n\nWedding Ritual Design for a Pluralistic Society by Carson\n\nA recollection of, and guide to, hand-crafting a syncretic, modern, and personal wedding ceremony.\n\nFlirtations with Death by Carson\n\nNecro-posting an old note from my Medium with some extra explication on the macabre.\n\nADHD: Steroids, The Gym, and The Game  by Carson\n\nThe Game is changing, and this is twice as true on college campuses, where the amphetamine black market is booming … Given my own experience and that of friends, I was surprised to see the positive effects [of meditation] were so mild, until I saw the meditation protocols. … Would you go to the gym for 5 minutes a day and expect any sort of change?\n\nThis contact form will send to a tagged place in my email, where I am likely to see and respond to it.\n\nAbout\n\nScience\n\nCreative Content\n\nContact\n\nTwitter\n\nSubstack\n\nYouTube\n\nGithub\n\nLinkedIn\n\nCV/Resume\n\nGoogle Scholar profile\n\nLinkedIn profile\n\nResearch Tools\n\nSubstack Essays\n\nMedium Essays (will move to Substack)\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nSend Message\n\n© Carson McNeil.\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nCarson McNeil\n\nWelcome\n\nResearch and Teaching\n\nYouTube Lectures\n\nEssays"

Robi goes out of his way to find out what you like and makes it happen—whether it’s having your favorite tea at home or planning a perfect camping trip. His meticulous planning and execution make him a reliable and enjoyable partner.\n\n30 years old\n\n5’8”\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NYC\n\n<aside>\n🌎 Born in Washington, DC, Robi spent his formative years in Arlington, Virginia, and later lived in Williamsburg, Fairfax, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, before settling in New York City in 2023.\n\n</aside>\n\nI’d be open to settling anywhere when I’m married, with slight preference for somewhere on the east coast like DC or Boston.\n\nMA in Data Science from Harvard\n\nBS in Chemistry from William and Mary\n\n<aside>\n📝\n\nTeam\n\nData Scientist at Epoch\n\nI’m a data scientist at Epoch, a nonprofit researching the future of artificial intelligence. I love having smart coworkers and doing intellectually engaging work that a lot of influential people rely on.\n\n<aside>\n🏦 Income: $90,000 Net Worth: $200,000\n\nI’ve taken the Giving What We Can pledge, where members promise to donate 10% of their income for the rest of their lives towards helping other people.\n\n<aside>\n💼 Robi deliberately chose a path that allows him to tackle some of the world’s biggest problems and make a significant impact. His love for his job is evident, as he finds fulfillment in helping others and creating positive change. Currently, he is deeply involved in groundbreaking projects, including a follow-up to the study \"Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?\" where he explores the future of AI technologies.\n\nwww.linkedin.com\n\n<aside>\n🌱 Robi has one younger brother. He maintains a close relationship with everyone in his family.\n\nWants children\n\nI hope my kids grow up to feel fulfilled and like they have opportunities to do whatever they want. If they’re interested in music, I’ll buy them whatever instrument they want to play. If they want to be athletes, I’ll take them to practice.\n\nRobi is not religious. He identifies as moderately left wing, but does not consider himself strongly political.\n\nSense of Humor\n\nI like to make funny comparisons between things or that are related in surprising ways. I like to say ridiculous things in deadpan, or poke fun at things that are obviously wrong by pretending to agree with them.\n\nSpeaks Spanish\n\nLikes pets but doesn’t have any\n\nHas been to over 20 countries\n\nGRE: 340 (2017) SAT: 1570 (2011)\n\nRobi is a firm believer in continuous self-improvement. He approaches self-betterment by focusing on one aspect of himself each year, aiming to become the best version of himself. Currently, he’s dedicated to getting back in shape, having recently joined a gym and setting a goal to lose five pounds.\n\n<aside>\n🧠 Big 5: Openness: 88\nConscientiousness: 75\nExtraversion: 46\nAgreeableness: 92\nNeuroticism: 1\n\nIn 2021, I started a New Year’s resolution accountability group with ten of my friends where we set goals and met each week to talk about our progress. The accountability was a superpower, because if you tell someone you’ll do something, you don’t want to let them down by not doing it. I set goals to run a 10k in under an hour, learn the flags and capitals of every country, and to exercise and practice Spanish every day.\n\n<aside>\n💘 Love Languages: Quality Time\nWords of Affirmation\n\nWhen it comes to family dynamics, Robi seeks a balanced 50/50 partnership. His job offers generous paternity leave, and he is open to discussions about family roles, emphasizing flexibility and mutual support. He envisions a future where both partners contribute equally, in various ways, to the relationship’s success.\n\n*My greatest passion is making the world a better place. I’ve done thousands of hours volunteering for effective altruism. EA is a small group of people that has an outsized impact, like preventing millions of cases of malaria and helping develop several vaccines. Besides global health, we work on other important issues such as climate change and preventing nuclear war.\n\nI think you must treat everyone fairly, and you should consider the well-being of other people, not just yourself, when deciding what to do.*\n\nRock Climbing\n\nUltimate Frisbee\n\nBallroom Dancing\n\nReading\n\nWriting\n\nFoodie\n\nCooking\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nRobi is a skilled cook and once won a food photography contest.\n\nRobi Rahman (@robi_rahman) on X\n\nInstagram (@robirahman94)\n\nBio\n\nEducation\n\nCareer\n\nFamily\n\nReligion/Politics\n\nOther Facts\n\nPersonality\n\nRelationship Dynamics\n\nCore Values\n\nInterests\n\nSocial Media"

      "fullText": "I am trying to find the woman most similar to myself. Maybe you are her, maybe you know her.\n\nTakes 2-3 minutes to read. Photographs at the bottom.\n\nAbbreviated version: I am an only child of a single mother, born 1991, Irish American, from north of Chicago. I don’t want children or pets. I am interested in art history, and philosophy.\n\n…\n\nI am somewhat of a reserved person, so to put myself out here, publicly, is not something I want to do.\n\nMy mother had me young, while still in college. We lived at her parents’ house.\n\nA lot of my childhood was spent listening to classic rock and watching Nick at Nite sitcoms.\n\nI lived a grunge rock teenage life: skateboarding, drugs, promiscuity, partying, and playing in a band.\n\nNow, I’m working on my second novel “The Depth of Middleclass Sorrow: a comedy”. My first novella “Tangled Shadows” is very important to me, and I hope it is significant to my future girlfriend too.\n\nThe best description of my personality is sincere, and analytic.\n\nI try to always be as kind and considerate as possible, though I was not always this way (I used to be an obnoxious, terrible person).\n\nI have been called “as funny as Eddie Murphy”.\n\nFor some time, I was a dedicated criminal. I had a crush on a woman who liked gangsters, so I ended up a felon (car theft), if she liked doctors: I would have tried to get a medical degree. I wanted to be a guerrilla soldier, but it is probably better that I was trying to rob jewelry stores, instead of making car bombs.\n\nEthnically/culturally, I am IrishAmerican-Catholic, from north of Chicago. Also, genetically, but not culturally, I am a quarter Mexican which is where I get my tan.\n\nI spend most of my time thinking about: philosophy, science, religion, mysticism, politics, culture, art, art history, psychoanalysis, math, history, sociology, anthropology, etc., and want someone with to have long, interesting discussions.\n\nMy main hobbies are biking, wall tennis, going to the movies, driving fast, reading, writing, museums, concerts, playing cards, travel, trivia, meditating, and sunbathing.\n\nRandom things I want to do: study history and vocabulary, lose 25 pounds/get in shape, work on craft/science/art projects, learn a trade, learn some Welsh (I can speak some Spanish).\n\nI used to look down on internet dating, because it was not the traditional way people met, but now: I see it as exceedingly more practical than traditional dating, and it can be romantic too.\n\nI have talked a lot about myself, but I am not an egocentric person. I will be at least equally interested, if not, mostly likely more interested in you (my future partner), than myself.\n\nBeware: if you become my girlfriend, you will be the most important person to me: I will sincerely care for you, and I will want to spend most of my time with you.\n\nIt is a non-negotiable of mine: someone who is also an only child of a single mother.\n\nI apologize for any typos or errors, I went to American public school.\n\nTo write (and maybe get some free margaritas):\n\nxavierjayrichards@aol.com\n\nIf you want to know the movies, music, books, and T.V. shows I like, ask me, I have a long list: I took down to make it quicker to read. Also, I have a longer version of this dating autobiography (if you are interested), that I cut down, because someone told me I “did not have to be so honest”, and to make it quicker to read.\n\nP.S.\n\nI wish there was a website/app where you could search: Polish, middle child, heavy metal, and find all the people like you, but that has yet to exist. A free search engine of dating profiles. Please someone make it.\n\nI should also say: I don’t want children, but I am open to possibly dating someone who has children. Like most people, I went through a phase of wanting to have children. Nor do I want pets, though I am good with animals, and had cats, a dog, and fish growing up: I don’t want the responsibility, and I don’t like the hair and waste of animals.\n\nThank you, very much, for reading. Maybe I know your best romantic match, and would be happy to introduce you.\n\nPlease share if you would.\n\nI have never really liked the name of this website. It comes from a time: I was drunk, on my back, in my apartment lobby, and someone asked if I “needed help”, and I thought to myself “that is something people do?”. I thought of a better name (but forgot it), but dont think it is important enough to change it. I’d rather not have this website, but how else do you find 1 person out of 8 billion?\n\nI hope everyone has happiness, choices, wisdom, good fortune, and finds their best romantic match, so on and such. And please, always try to be as kind and considerate as possible.\n\n."

      "fullText": "I am someone who I would want to be with. I am content with myself and I strive to correct any part of myself that is in misalignment with what’s best for me/others/all. I started that process at 18 years old, and now I am 34, as of July 13 2024. What I am seeking to create with someone is very specific. If I remove everything that I would like off the table and keep just one thing, it would be this, that what we create together is a level of conversation and understanding of each other, to the deepest levels possible, and break that limit. This is what I am saying right now. The goal for me is not love, and not to escape the horrors of the world. I am seeking deeper understanding of myself, and of the mind, so that I can use that understanding to better.\n\nI am not sharing my location or real name. I am aware I am different, so I try to take some measure of respect.\n\nI am not sharing photos because photos are deceiving. I really don’t care about appearance. You can have the most beautiful woman in front of me and I wouldn’t care. Just look how you want to look. Obviously, within the principle of what’s best for all, we have to take care of ourselves, our bodies, to make sure that we are strong.\n\nIf you are looking for physical attraction, then I am not interested. If you want to explore effective sex, then know that I have achieved easy multi orgasms, which is part of not stimulating the mind, and instead working directly with the physical experience.\n\nI can write out pages of my positive attributes. And I can write out all of my experiences and perspectives. I believe that above though is already weird enough to dissuade most people.\n\nworkefficient777@gmail.com"

It means not going to the extremes while realizing that perfect centrism is also a form of extremism. Being a goal-focused future-oriented person, now I am learning to enjoy the process more.\n\nLooking for a confidant who shares the vision of what a family should look like, yet we are different enough to complement and inspire each other.\n\nSee my Linkedin profile here\n\nMy public profile\n\nSocial impact accomplished by my team: Physician Investor Alliance\n\nSourcing and investing in genuine and talented people through my Physician Investor Alliance platform. Reduce access barrier between synergistic talents so they have the opportunity to form aligned teams to pursue their dreams/missions. Advocate and support companies that create physician-friendly products.\n\nOutdoor activities. Know a bit of many sports but not good at any particular one, just trying to stay away from screen after work. Not sure if it has anything to do with my Neanderthal genes, but inside me there is an inclination toward the nature.\n\nI cook everyday and avoid restaurant foods (when possible) due to my affinity for less fatty and salty food. Also grow organic vegetables at a local community garden.\n\nNo child but want at least one, and I hope you are the same\n\nSubscribe Subscribed Find Your Family Cofounder Sign me up Already have a WordPress.com account?

I don’t care that much about money - but I do like to make money? I’m not sure about that one way or the other.\n\nI think I’m kind, interesting and thoughtful. I’m 5’9” or 5’10”? I like to keep my hair messy. And I wear a lot of interesting hoodies.  I have a law degree from Oxford. An undergraduate classics degree from UConn. I spend most of my time programming or doing law or walking.\n\n(Oh looking to date  - then see if you are interested in getting married - and I want to have children)\n\nI’m atheist, but I think in another time period, I would have been religious. I have had a number of different periods in my life when I was gripped by ideas. First, it was classics. Then, it was law (especially contract law). Then, it was computers. Now, it’s AI and machine learning. I talk about the ideas that I like pretty constantly. I tell a lot of jokes.\n\nWhat I really want to know are your interests! And, I want you to share them with me. I want to be with someone that wants to share their observations with me.\n\nI really like physical touch and to hold hands. I want someone that I can spend a lot of my time with as the relationship progresses. I really have very few demands. I like to let me partner live out their goals. But, I like my partner to let me live out mine. I’m small “c” conservative (so, monogamous). I’m thoughtful - but low key. I also try my best.\n\nPrevious partners have described me as “kind”, “thoughtful”, “gentle”, “honest” and “adventurous”. My most successful relationships have been with girls that were like me (not in a background sense but in a love style and ideas and career sense).\n\nI’ve also been described as “playful”.\n\nI’ve never had trouble with career but my career has been super unusual. I went from legal assistant to Chief Compliance Officer at a 2k person company. There is a whole story there. The company went public. I then took 2 years off. Then was first employee as Chief Product Officer at a Regulatory AI company. I just quit.\n\nI think about my career a lot - but I min-max for ideas. I don’t think anyone should worry about whether I have a provider mindset - I don’t - but I make up the difference by being highly performant and knowing what I want - and the things I want have always been highly remunerated.\n\nI’m not a rationalist. I honestly feel like I missed the boat on that; but the rationalists I’ve met are super interesting. I have a developed thought about what it means to be a good person, but I’m pretty tempered on all of this. I feel like that’s the benefit of getting older.\n\nI end up with friends across a very wide age bracket (my oldest friends are in their early 50s and my youngest friends are early 20s).\n\nIntroduction\n\nIdeas\n\nLove Style\n\nCareer etc…\n\nPhilosophy"

If you think we might be a good match, I’d love to hear from you: please fill in this form .\n\n<aside>\n💡 This is weird: I dislike writing about myself, and my primary partner was excited to draft this for me, so this doc mostly describes me through his eyes. I’ve added comments where I would characterize myself differently. This document carried the prose of my primary partner moreso than my own voice.\n\n</aside>\n\n👉 You can also read the doc I wrote for myself (sans partner intervention) here .\n\nI <3 Francesca, she’s awesome, and I feel super lucky to be her friend and partner!\n\nBurning Man, Mudpocalypse edition\n\nThe guy who wrote this dating doc\n\n🌉 San Francisco & Oakland-based\n\n🐣 In my early 30’s\n\n🏳️‍🌈 Bi: I think I’d like to date all genders, but thus far I’ve only dated men . I’m open to more! 😉\n\n🎨 Crafty : I love creating things (I draw professionally as a digital illustrator ), make cool hats (like my persimmon-shaped hat ), fish backpacks , and so much more!\n\n🤪 Goofy : I enjoy being playful and uninhibited (with people I know well). I start out quite shy, however.\n\n🤫 Introverted : I’m not excited about being in big groups, especially with strangers, and it takes me a while to recharge from social situations. As a result, sometimes people who are just meeting me might see me as a bit colder… but once I get to know people I can be fun and goofy (see above!).\n\n🔐 A private person : I am an open book. But I am also the kind of person who won’t put that contents of that book on social media, or share personal details with others unless its on a need-to-know basis. I value my privacy and don’t often share things with strangers.\n\n🫂 Caring : my friends know me as being extremely empathetic, and go out of my way to help others - maybe even to a fault!\n\n🍣 Foodie : I love trying new foods, even though I’m a vampire-white American - when I travel, I’ll try almost anything once. Some of my favorites are jjajangmyeon , raw fish or poke (e.g. from Foodland ), and mentaiko bowls. Let’s go on food adventures!\n\n✈️ Adventurous : I said “yes” to packing up everything and nomading in 2020, and also went on a 2 week adventure diving through the Galapagos and exploring other parts of South America last year. Burning Man is kind of my vibe too. I like doing this with other people, but it will take me a while to build up the trust to do this with you!\n\n🤼 Addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu : I know I go 6 times a week, but it’s not a problem, I swear. Just one more hit. 🥺\n\n👪 Poly-ish : I’ve started experimenting with having multiple partners, and I’ve enjoyed it so far! I’m a solo-poly type - I have a primary partner I live with, and date alone (as much as he might like to date you too 😜).\n\nTestimonials\n\nWho I am"

      "fullText": "Note: You may prefer to see my profile on this other useful website , which has both more detail and more pictures of me, but you'll need to sign up for that to see the whole thing.\n\nHi! I'm Harry Altman, aka Sniffnoy.  You might have encountered me on the\n    internet before.  I do math, and in particular I can talk your ear off about\n    the problem of writing numbers with ones, addition, and multiplication!  And\n    lots of variants of the problem.  I won't do that here though, I'll save\n    that for later.  :D\n\nAlso I like infinities.  I've also been working a bunch on doing silly\n    things with infinities.  This is actually much easier, but unfortunately\n    it's way harder to explain to people!  Again, best saved for another time.\n    :)  Also various other math things, like some neat Fibonacci things\n    recently, but, uh, this isn't supposed to be a research statement, so I'll\n    move on to a different topic. :P\n\nI don't actually have an academic position anywhere, so this past 5 years\n    I've worked a programming job to support my math habit. :)  I was writing an\n    Ethereum smart contract debugger, if you're interested; but that's come to a\n    close now so now I have a lot more time to get other things done again!\n\nOK so the thing is... like, I guess this is a place to describe oneself,\n    but I'm kind of averse to doing that?  I guess a big thing there is that I\n    worry about verbal overshadowing and also creating fixity, that by\n    describing myself I will thereby cause myself to identify with those\n    descriptions, which is something I want to avoid.\n\nSo, well, I guess I will try to say only things that are quite definitely\n    true, or to show rather than telling!\n\nI guess, I like things that are a bit off from what people expect.\n    Sometimes, as in my mathematical work, these things are quite natural -- but\n    nature doesn't always meet your expectations!  Or (to take a page from\n    Yudkowsky's book), I should say that people's expectations don't always meet\n    nature. 😁  Sometimes nice questions have nasty answers, and I like to\n    disgust people with them. :D  And sometimes nasty-seeming constructions have\n    nice results, and I like to amaze people with them!\n\nBut I'm interested in the artificial as well as the natural; a thing I\n    find really fascinating is, like, bizarrely complicated conventions and\n    understanding where they come from and all the weird cases they generate.\n    Things like text encoding (particularly Unicode) and data encoding in\n    computers; unusual calendars (it's fun to explain the Hebrew calendar to\n    people 😁); and other such things.  I am trying to more often say \"huh,\n    that's a strange word, I wonder where it comes from?\" and look up its\n    etymology.  So many things that appear to not make sense, the reason is, it\n    used to make sense, but then it wasn't updated when circumstances changed!\n    And I really like learning about the history of how that occurred.\n\nI also like taking pictures of the local wildlife, which mostly means\n    bugs and birds. :)  Here in New York mostly birds, I don't see a lot of good\n    bugs here.  Although there are rats! :D  Of course, rats don't like light or\n    people, which makes photographing them tricky, but it can be done!  Back in\n    Ann Arbor I'd see a lot more good bugs.\n\nUh, what are other good stories for illustrating myself?  Um, here's one\n    that comes to mind.  Once, I was visiting my friends Colin and Aviva out in\n    Chicago, and we were in the car, along with their dog, Gately.  (Gately has\n    since died, unfortunately.)  I was in the back seat, and Gately was in the\n    center of the car.  And I thought, you know, dogs are always sniffing each\n    other's butts. Gately's butt is right there; I could totally sniff it.  So\n    uh I tried sniffing Gately's butt.  It stunk!  Not that much though.  I\n    don't think I really learned anything from doing this. :P\n\n(Perhaps my favorite thing that anyone has ever said about me: \"Harry,\n    you are very good at making arguments, but you are not good at not doing\n    annoying things with the cat toy.\" 😁)\n\nMy homepage This is where you can find my papers and other neat little\n                things.\n\nThis is where you can find my papers and other neat little\n                things.\n\nMy Dreamwidth\n                blog Mostly just a silly personal blog, I also write about math here\n                and sometimes other thoughts.\n\nMostly just a silly personal blog, I also write about math here\n                and sometimes other thoughts.\n\nMy Facebook\n                profile This is where I post all my pictures!

      "fullText": "I am a run-of-the-mill carbon-based life form, living on the planet currently known as Earth (or so I've been told). If you're reading this, it's highly likely you've come across my profile on Hinge. This must be the fourth or fifth time I've created an account there. It's not that I haven't had any luck -- I've connected with some interesting people, but obviously nothing that has worked out well enough to stop me wanting to go back.\n\nI thought I'd write a profile (a \" date-me doc \" of sorts) for those piqued enough by the very limited window provided by Hinge to want to get to know me more, but on second thoughts I thought I'd do something different. So here's a list of reasons NOT to date me:\n\nThat's it for now, but I'm sure there are many more reasons to weigh the prospect of seeing and going out (or staying in) with me very carefully. I promise to add them to the list as and when they occur to me.\n\nI'm married. No two ways about it: some time in 2005, I entered into a civil marriage, which is still valid on paper. The marriage didn't work out, and my wife and I have lived separately since 2018. Neither of us see the point in getting a divorce as of now, but this will obviously change if there's a good enough reason for it. Needless to say, neither of us has problems with the other seeking other romantic interests.\n\nSteinbeck once referred to poor Americans seeing themselves as \"temporarily embarrassed millionaires\". Well in my case the pandemic and its aftermath has found me in a similar circumstance of temporary embarrassment (which I hope is truly temporary). I work with languages and have freelanced all my working life -- something that worked just fine, despite the unavoidable ups and downs, until a few years ago. Every now and then, it does begin to look like things might pick up again, but only time will tell if they really do. So all you prospective sugar babies can happily walk right past me and I hope you manage to find your pot(belly) of gold. But for those of you who might still be willing to overlook this: I have never been that interested in making money or other indicators of worldly success. Right now, the only interest I still have in doing so is to uphold my commitment to my children (did I mention I have children? Well I do: two of the most wonderful persons I've ever had the pleasure of knowing).\n\nI can be a bit of a curmudgeon -- it's hard to get me excited about what's happening in the world outside (or even convincing me of its existence on some days), at least not for its own worth. In the right company, however, even the most humdrum, everyday activities take on the aura of the most exciting thing the world has ever known, and more than anything else, this quest of mine is for that right company.\n\nHere's looking at me\n\nReport Page"

      "fullText": "Hey there! Glad you found your way to my date-me document.\n\nI shouldn’t actually be sideways but if I fix it in one place it breaks in others.\n\nPick your favorite style\n\nGeneral Info\n\nName: Dan\n\nAge: 30\n\nGender: M\n\nLooking for: Women\n\nLocation: Nottingham, UK - Open to chat though\n\nDating goals: Find a life partner\n\nPhysical health : I never get sick besides very rare migraines. But here’s the kicker: I was born 3 months early and therefore have cerebral palsy and mobility issues. Likely undiagnosed autistic as I struggle with social cues and have the physical compulsion to correct things people say (you can correct me too <3 )\n\nKids: I have always wanted kids although I fully appreciate that could be unfair on you given above, ( got lot’s of family members too) but of course it would be an adventure I’d give my all.\n\nOccupation: IT Developer\n\nEducation: BSc in ICT\n\nNationality: British, sadly no Welsh and the Welsh are cool\n\nHeight: 5’ 6”\n\nPolitics: A mix of left and right wing positions like any honest normal person.\n\nEveryone has some opinion that is offensive to someone :)\n\nOn my values:\n\nI value clear communication and honesty hoping we can make good memories and laughs together.\n\nOn going out:\n\nI consider myself an introvert with certain extroverted tendencies. Other people would be surprised at this as my mind is constantly going and I get a thrill from acting and public speaking.\n\nBut sometimes I need to switch off listening to an audio book, watch YouTube TV or read.\n\nBest music:\n\nNickelback\n\nBusted\n\nClassic Avril Lavigne\n\nClassic Fall Out Boy\n\nBest films:\n\nShrek 2\n\nThe Incredibles\n\nJohnny English\n\nBest writer:\n\nStephen King\n\nBest games\n\nLocal couch co-op (Play with me <3)\n\nOn family ties:\n\nIf my future partner is extremely close to their family, that would be awesome, but also not at all necessary.\n\nOn food:\n\nDon’t try to make me vegan. I love steak and whilst you can be healthy as a vegan you do have to be more careful. How boring\n\nOn humor:\n\nDad jokes\n\nOn sex:\n\nWhen we have been dating for a while I can tell you how I ended up in A&E.\n\nBad experience avoided intimacy but I am as far as I know healthy and looking to be sex-positive as the youth say.\n\nI’m eager to please, value enthusiastic consent and communication above all, and love finding out what excites my partner.\n\nNo problem with nudism, skinny dipping beaches etc but rules to live by no one should ever see my penis unexpectedly or unwantedly. Consent is sexy.\n\nFirmly of the opinion sex is meant to be funny as well as hot/exciting.\n\nOn my ideal partner:\n\nFears:\n\nRed flags:\n\nContact: https://www.cognitoforms.com/DanKendall/DanKendallDateMeContactFormAllOptional\n\nWhen we’ve dated for a while assuming you don’t hate me I may share my horny 14 year old perfect woman list. But to paraphrase boyzone, that's not anyone and who cares.\n\nThat I might not do my best\n\nI’ll get nervous. I either talk fast, stutter or shut down.\n\nThat I enjoy being drunk and I do\n\nOther normal insecurities\n\nStill live with parents in your 30s?! In my defense I always imagined I would move out with my future.\n\nKids section a bit too forward\n\nHow disabled? What are we talking about\n\nWhat political opinions? HOW LIKE ME ARE YOU\n\nI don’t have any offensive opinions\n\nTerrible taste in music/films IN YOUR OPINION\n\nYou won’t date a vegan?! No, I won't date a pushy vegan. Do you hate animals? No\n\nWhy did you talk about nudism in the on sex section? Nudism is not about sex. I agree, it seemed like the best cheeky place to put it.\n\nSounds/ looks like he’d be crap in bed. How rude? Do you want to put that to the test, little miss judgemental :D"

I’d love to find a nuanced thinker to have adventures, create and raise a kid or two, and conduct a 50 year conversation that never stops being interesting. If that might be you, and the description below sounds intriguing, get in touch !\n\n</aside>\n\n<aside>\n🎂 39 📏 6’2”📍LES/NYC 👶 No kids yet but excited to have some with the right woman!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI’m not much for small talk; here’s a sampling of the kind of thing I’ll want to talk about if we go on a date.\n\nWhat’s your heresy? Or put differently, what’s an opinion you hold that a community you consider yourself a member of would consider anathema?\n\nWhen’s the last time you changed your mind about something important?\n\nWhat’s something you’re an expert in? Like top 1% globally?\n\nIf you were empress of NYC for a day, what change or policy would you enact to make it a better city for the next 100 years? Think about actual policy levers, not magic-wand sorts of things.\n\nTell me a story about a trip you took that taught you most about yourself (or reality)\n\nWho are your heroes? Who do you routinely read/pay attention to?\n\nWhat do you aspire to?\n\nMe (second from right) coordinating with local counterparts.\n\nIn my final year of undergrad, I redesigned a water supply system in Ecuador. After graduation, I flew down with my team and built it! We organized ~400 volunteers over a week and a half to enlarge sections of pipe, install valves and meters, and restore equitable access to a water supply system that served 5 villages in the hills above Otovalo. I also managed a sewer project in El Salvador through Engineers Without Borders.\n\nI spent 2 years living and working in Uganda as a Peace Corps Volunteer. While there, I started this company , still operating - some of my proudest work!\n\nStarted a machine-learning startup (now defunct) with my best friend\n\nOne of my favorite economists, Arnold Kling, ran a Fantasy Intellectual Teams competition. I am the undefeated champion\n\nWhen I went to Azerbaijan in 2023, I enjoyed their national dish ( Shakh Plov ) so much, I taught myself how to make it when I came home.\n\nReading See below for my “holy canon”, but I’m constantly reading great sci-fi or history related to an upcoming trip\n\nTravel I’m in an informal competition with my dad to visit the most countries. My current count is 50. This year (2024) I’m planning trips to Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Taiwan, China, Poland, Germany, Czechia, Austria and maybe Pakistan. In 2023 I visited Senegal, Norway, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Sweden, Hungary, and Slovakia.\n\nIn 7th grade I won the City of Madison spelling bee. I still resent  “pica”, the word I lost on at the state competition, as well as “pika” - the adorable animal homonym - out of spite.\n\nUncle-ing It’s my great honor to be “Uncle Jon” to 3 kids of my close friends. I can’t wait to be a dad of my own, but in the meantime I take great delight in being the funcle.\n\nBoard games Every August I buy (and get mildly obsessed with) that year’s board game of the year, and I host a monthly-ish gathering of friends for food and games.\n\nRoad trips/camping/hiking My trusty steed (above) is named Dawn Treader, and she is the finest roadtripmobile in all the land. We have ~50,000 miles together. I’ll never say no to a new national park, though I indulged that hobby a bit more when I lived in Seattle.\n\nBeauty I try to bring something beautiful back from every country I visit, and infuse a small bit of what caught my eye there into some part of my daily life. Sometimes it’s a painting, or a knicknack for my shelf, or a recipe I learn. Very often, my aesthetic taste inclines toward the hexagonal.\n\nQuestions I’m likely to ask you on a first date\n\nThings I’ve accomplished (roughly chronologically)\n\nInterests\n\nAttributes/Things that I am"

I always think a lot before I say something… pursue one thing… Someone who says what’s on their mind, like play, litefooted, jumps from one thing to another.”\n\n“She’ll be a muse for your prophet. Like symbiosis in nature. The tree, strong and unbending, and the moss, growing inside, forcing it to adapt. There are symbiotic and asymbiotic relationships. The muse generates the ideas, the prophet has the patience to write them down. Just don’t let the muse – different, fascinating – take away all your energy. Is your partner dominant or submissive?”\n\n“Dominant, but not in the sense of controlling. But…”\n\n“kindling a flame.”\n\nSong quotes\n\nSpotify playlist\n\n\"It's a whole new place with a brand new attitude, but you still gotta catch 'em all and be the best you can be.\" (Pokemon Johto)\n\n\"I'll fly until the end of the sky, so I'll be the one who doesn't have to say goodbye.\" (Rainbow Dash, in I’ll Fly)\n\n\"Your love makes me see things so clearly\" (Anna Rose, Vienna Teng)\n\n\"I used to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly when I'm asleep\" (Fireflies, Owl City)\n\n\"Am I human or am I dancer?\" (Human, The Killers)\n\n\"I don't know my purpose in this, but it's obvious it's minuscule at best.\" (Time Bending, Loquat)\n\n\"Sadness is a blessing\" (Lykke Li)\n\n\"And the less I seek my source for some definitive, the closer I am to fine\" (Closer to Fine, Indigo Girls)\n\n\"They were kids that I once knew Now they're all dead hearts to you\" (Dead Hearts, Stars)\n\n“Open up your window shades and illuminate” (Illuminate, Afrojack)\n\n“I hope you find the love that's true So the morning light can shine on you” (Shine, Benjamin Francis Leftwich)\n\n“Hold on when you give love, let go when you give it” (Stars)\n\n“Just leave me your stardust to remember you by” (Boats & Birds, Gregory and the Hawk)\n\n“Come down now, they'll say.

Sorry!’ ‘Yeah you should be! We caught bugs and toads and feelings!” (At The Cemetery, Madilyn Mei)\n\nQuotes\n\n\"Back when she was afraid of the dark she always brought a flashlight. But it turned out that was exactly why she was afraid. The whole world was black and she was a shining target.\" (Saskiad, Brian Hall)\n\n“If we do not suffer with our pain, then we have not learned about anything but ourselves. Pain without suffering is like victory without struggle.” (Shantaram, Gregory David Roberts)\n\n“when there is love, the widowed must stay for the resurrection of the beloved - so that the one who has gone is not really dead, but grows and is created for a second time in the soul of the living.” (The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers)\n\n\"A certain type of perfection can only be realized through a limitless accumulation of the imperfect.\" (Kafka on the Shore, Haruki Murakami)\n\n\"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.\" (Francis Bacon)\n\n\"I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks but for the ledger of our daily work.\" (Neil Armstrong)\n\nBooks\n\nGoodreads\n\nAnathem; The Diamond Age, Neal Stephenson\n\nExhalation; Stories of Your Life and Others, Ted Chiang\n\nThe Saskiad, Brian Hall\n\nInheritance trilogy, N.K.

Morning is the best time for creative work.\n\nIt's important for me to have unbroken time to work on academic and creative projects, as well as time and space to think and reflect.\n\nWind down in the evening: read, listen to music, journal.\n\nMy dual academic and writing profession calls for a measured, habitual life: a stable foundation is what allows me to accrue my research and creative work.\n\nIt’s important for me to experience new things! Having a stable life allows for the safety to explore . I make room for adventure on weekends and summer breaks!\n\nI’m organized, logical, capable of putting aside feelings and getting things done. I can offer firm support and a listening ear.\n\nI want to be drawn out of my narrow focus. Emote, be spontaneous, inspire me with your wacky thoughts, take me on an adventure, share your favorite movies, shows, songs,... See conversation .\n\nI would say that \"acts of service\" and \"quality time\" are my primary love languages; I welcome them all. But giving gifts can be stressful:P\n\nA partner has to be a best friend, a romance has to be a deep friendship.\n\nI want to learn your story! What’s important to me in a relationship is people being there for each other, “witnessing” each other’s lives, being emotionally connected on a (semi-)permanent level. I believe in building trust and keeping promises.\n\nI believe in open, honest communication--a relationship where it’s okay to work out complicated emotions together.\n\nConflict is inevitable--it’s how we deal with it that counts. Let’s listen & talk it through together with nonviolent communication!\n\nDoing a creative project together is a great way to connect. If you’re a creator too, then I’d be happy to help out and share our creative journeys.\n\n🌶 get a meal/tea/coffee\n\n🌶 go on a walk/bike ride\n\n🌶 go to a movie/show and share our afterthoughts\n\n🌶🌶 work through some deep questions (like the NYT questions on the way to love )\n\n🌶🌶 read an article/story/book or listen to a podcast episode and talk about it\n\n🌶🌶 give a “museum tour” of our spaces and neighborhoods according to us\n\n🌶🌶🌶 share passages from our journals\n\n🌶🌶🌶 play a 2-player RPG (like Star Crossed - romance RPG with Jenga tower)\n\n[your idea here]\n\nwriting group meetings\n\nimprov comedy ( BIG , Highwire ) (currently focusing on musical improv)\n\nbook/story/podcast discussion groups\n\nNAAAP (National Association of Asian American Professionals)\n\nBaltimore bike party\n\nFinish my novel & get published!\n\nHave meaningful creative collaborations; I’d love to expand beyond traditional writing to projects that are more experimental or interactive.\n\nFor much of my life (including the present) I’ve struggled with focusing too much on achievement (climbing caterpillar pillars ), and I want to have the confidence to go my own path without feeling like I have to measure up, and always keep a spirit of play in my work.\n\nDevelop deeper friendships. Find better ways of relating to people, e.g., authentic relating, Burning Man culture.\n\nIn college, I was in a vegetarian co-op and that was the period in my life where I felt the greatest degree of belonging. I yearn to be part of a similar community, whether through co-operative living or another tight-knit group.\n\nGo on adventures to new places and cultures and meet people.\n\nGo on a long-distance biking/hiking trip!\n\nBe more of a knight of infinite resignation; be content in sadness; be in touch with emotions and be okay.\n\nI want to be a romantic (how to define? believing in hopes and dreams, that good begets good, in gifts freely given, in trusting feelings--stepping off the path of the mind onto the path of the heart, in the sacredness and importance of small things and gestures, in things freely said, that the world is kind and someone can catch you if you fall, that no you don't need to take off the glasses of optimism, in conversations that flow like poetry, in not having to justify oneself)\n\nBe an intellectual in a broader sense: being well-read, blogging, having discussions about ideas\n\nGrapple with the development of AI: Understand it on a foundational mathematical and scientific level and do my small part to point its development towards human flourishing.\n\nBe a good educator--I’m  a big believer in self-directed & collaborative learning and interested in homeschooling."

I immigrated from Haiti in 2018. I have lived and went to college in New York and have been living in the South Bay for over 2 years. I am a sister, a cousin, a godmother, and a friend to many. I value family and friendships a lot and a continuous goal of mine is to maintain and nurture these relationships. I consider myself an introvert but can be outgoing in the right settings and with the right people.\n\nI like cooking and love trying new recipes, at least every month. They don’t always turn out how I want to but it’s always a good time and a fun experience (see my failed attempt at baking croissants and eclairs below)\n\nI lived on island for most of my life so I love the beach and feeling the warm sand in between my toes. I am also a sucker for a beautiful sunset and will always stop to admire and snap a few pictures (see below).\n\nI have tried many sports such as basketball, tennis, boxing, swimming, muay thai, and kickboxing. I’m currently doing the latter. My mantra is to try some things at least once . This applies to sports and other aspects of my life.\n\nI am software engineer now (I studied CS and Accounting) and I have dreams/goals to venture into other careers that are fulfilling and meaningful to me.\n\nI have mostly volunteered within the tech industry either as a mentor or a website developer for non-profit organizations in the Bay Area.\n\n26 years old, 5’2, Black Latina\n\nSingle, Monogamous and Cishet woman\n\nReligious,  Liberal\n\nIn Brief,\n\nHobbies\n\nWork, Volunteering\n\n💃🏾Things that excite me:"

I am independent and mature person who sincerely want a mutual soul that we can explore our beautiful life together. I take relationship seriously and i know what i want clearly. So let us ‘date’ each other on the premise of a kind heart and mutual respect.\n\nLOVE LIFE： I think that Life is a process of experience. I know myself better by experiencing the world. I have traveled many countries, like the UK, France, Italy ,South Korean, Thailand, Japan etc.  I can see there’re variety of ways to live in the world. Different people in different countries live in their own ways. I can figure out what kind of life i want exactly through traveling. I want my life to be：with a man i love, with some achievement in my work, with the expectation in my day.\n\nLOVE THE ONE ：In my imagination, I think you should be also a mutual person who know what you want clearly. You should be kind, and responsible enough to start a relationship. Our relationship will be simple and happy. We will get together only because of LOVE, but no other reality factors, such as money, the needs of having kids or a spousal visa…\n\nABOUT ME\n\nWhat I am looking for"

I'm 5'9\", happy, active, and loving 🤗 Friends call me driven, adventurous, stable, and a good listener.\n\nReligion isn't important to me, and I consider myself secularly Jewish ✡️ and liberal-leaning.\n\nNever married, no kids. I'm on a quest to find (and be!) an amazing life partner, and excited to start a family someday\n\nI lead an awesome team commercializing new ways of delivering healthcare through tech-backed services.\n\nAfter earning my MBA while working full-time, I launched healthcare products at Fortune 500 companies, then took my learnings to the startup world to build a better healthcare system.\n\nMy professional mission is to grow products that help people improve their own health.\n\nSpeaking to 200+ people at a recent conference\n\nHalfway up my first multi-pitch trad lead\n\nI'm very active and love the outdoors. Once I spent 50 days in the wilderness without a tent 😱 Those days are done but here's some ways I love to explore:\n\n- Climbing - Running\n\n- Hiking                 - Biking\n\n- Paddling             - SCUBA\n\n- Foraging             - Birdwatching\n\nInside I lift weights and climb. Doing this stuff with a partner is great! But it's ok if it's not your jam. Regardless of how we get there, prioritizing health is important.\n\nMusic colors my inner life. I love to write songs (samples below) and jam on piano, guitar, and harmonica 🎹 I'll take any excuse to sing or dance. Classical, Jazz, and Indie Folk Rock are my fav genres.\n\nThe arts inspire me. Dabbling in nature photography helped me amass a strong collection of macro mushroom photos 🍄\n\nI listen to 60+ audiobooks a year, mostly classic literature, sci-fi, fantasy, self-improvement, business, and futurism. I also ♥️ poetry.\n\nExcerpt: Rock song from high school 🎙️\n\nExcerpt: Opera overture from college 🎹\n\nExcerpt: Orchestra piece post-college 🎻\n\nMy small family lives in Ithaca, NY. We're close and see each other regularly. I moved to Boston from CA in 2020 to be closer to them and still in a fun city.\n\nFrom my veterinarian mom I got my love of animals and science, and my goofiness 😜 From my professor dad I got my love of learning and humanities, and my rational edge 🤓\n\nI have great friends from every stage of life. For volunteering, I lead outdoor trips and community gatherings for the Appalachian Mountain Club and foster rescue dogs with Great Dog Rescue New England.\n\nFriend Week nightly feast in Outer Banks\n\nLeading a hike with AMC (I'm far right)\n\nMy friend's kiddo\n\nMy last foster dog, Rosie\n\nCarrying friend's kid over a creek\n\nDrop me a line and let me know a bit about your life!\n\nInstagram: @carlyflew\n\nHome\n\nMore Photos\n\nMore Home More Photos\n\nCarly's Profile\n\nBasic Bio\n\nMore about my life\n\nWork\n\nFitness\n\nMusic + The Arts\n\nCommunity\n\nMore Pics\n\nGet in Touch"

      "fullText": "Over the last couple years, I've gotten a lot more serious about finding a life partner. This piece is an exercise in being intentional; in outlining who I am, what I bring to a relationship, and what I'm looking for in a partner. I've often struggled to articulate these things effectively, so I've decided to sit down and write this, however cringey it may be. In large part, I'm writing this for myself, but I guess it might help to share it too.\n\nIf you think you're right for me (or have someone in mind), please reach out .\n\nMy name is William Wolf ( né Strimling ).\n\nI'm 29 years old, but I'm a bit of an old soul. I generally find that I relate more to people older than me. I'm on the cusp of Gen Z, but I'm definitely more of a Millenial at heart.\n\nI am 5' 7\" (~169cm) tall, if height is important to you . It's probably the thing I'm most self-conscious about and also my superpower, because I find that it causes people to underestimate me.\n\nI have a large, blended family. My parents are divorced, and each has a new partner. I have three siblings: one biological sister, a step-brother, and a step-sister. I'm the youngest. I have cousins I don't have much of a relationship with, and second-cousins once-removed who I see often. There are also many people I consider family who aren't related to me at all.\n\nI grew up in Piedmont, CA , which is just across the bay from San Francisco. Most of my family still lives around there. I hate San Francisco because I love San Francisco .\n\nI went to the University of Washington in Seattle, where I studied Computer Science. I didn't really like Seattle. The weather was too dreary, and I found the people standoffish. That said, I don't think there's anywhere in the world more beautiful than Seattle in the summertime.\n\nI love to travel . I always feel like I haven't done enough of it. New York City is home right now (and the best city), but San Francisco is the center of my world (both personally and professionally), and my heart is in Tel Aviv. Eventually, I'd like to live a life that allows for traveling frequently or even living across multiple places.\n\nI'm a creative technologist. I know that term sounds kind of bullshity, but it's the most descriptive way I've come up with of describing the work I do. Right now, I'm the founder of a venture-backed tech startup (my second one). In the past I've been a software engineer, a product designer, a product manager, a visual journalist, and a researcher. I'm most interested in the ways technology can help bring people closer together — which was the basis for my current startup and my previous one. You can learn more about my professional career on my website .\n\nI am Jewish, and had a Bar Mitzvah, but am not very religious otherwise. However, I resonate a lot with Jewish values and find a lot of belonging in Jewish communities. So, I think of it as being an important part of my identity. I have also lived in Israel , and consider myself a Zionist.\n\nI am socially progressive and fiscally moderate. I think alignment on politics is important, so, briefly — I believe love is love, you can identify however you want, and that a woman should be empowered to choose to end a pregnancy. I support social safety nets, universal health care, and regulation against anti-competitive business practices. I love America; it's not without its faults, but I love how it enables class mobility, supports entrepreneurship, and fosters unparalled diversity.\n\nI'm an avid reader. I enjoy reading everything from contemporary fiction, to German literature, to dense biographies, to research papers, to popsci, and everything in between. I used to read 50+ books a year, but now it's closer to one every other week.\n\nI live an active life. I exercise almost every day, usually for about an hour. I enjoy weightlifting for fitness and as a sort of meditative activity. For recovery, I've been getting into yoga. For cardio, I try to run or erg 2-3x a week. As trite as it sounds, I really like walking, and try to get in at least 15k steps per day. I also enjoy hiking and snowboarding, but don't get to do either nearly enough.\n\nI try to eat well, but don't follow a strict diet. At one point I followed a ketogenic diet, but I found that obsessing about carbs was itself unhealthy, and, more importantly, it made me unhappy. Being flexible about what I eat is one of my greatest joys — I love trying new foods and cuisines without much consideration for ingredients. That said, I do my best to avoid processed and fast foods.\n\nI don't smoke or do drugs. I sometimes drink alcohol, but almost never to the point of being drunk. I have infrequently smoked weed in my life, but it's not something I'm into. I have tried psychadelics too, but again, it's not something that's important to me.\n\nI'm fairly extroverted. I prefer being around people and enjoy meeting strangers. I maintain a lot of friendships including childhood friends, college friends, work friends, and random people I met at parties, hostels, and coffee shops. I'm not really into \"going out,\" for the most part. I find crowds overwhelming, and I vastly prefer sitting and having a conversation with someone. I love dancing, but mostly poorly at home, rather than at a club.\n\nI take life pretty seriously. I like to have fun and go on adventures, but I don't think anyone would describe me as care-free. I find what makes me happy is focusing on what gives me purpose (my work, helping people) and what gives me belonging (family, community). I love investing in relationships and projects. For most things I do in life — I'm in it for the long-haul. I don't give up easily on people or on things I believe in. I do what I say I'll do, and I show up.\n\nI'm ambitious, but not goal-oriented. I love to build things, and I get most excited about projects that have the potential to effect change at-scale in some way. I also try to constantly challenge myself and compare myself only to who I was before, rather than to other people. I think it's nice to have goals, but either you don't reach them and feel an undeserved sense of failure, or do reach them and ask yourself \"now what?\" Instead, I try to focus on continuing to find ways to do what I love to do, so long as I'm able to provide for myself (and eventually, my family).\n\nI pride myself on being self-reliant . I don't want to ever depend on someone else for my happiness, safety, or sense of purpose.\n\nI love drinking tea. I got really into it during COVID, in lieu of baking sourdough bread. Now I collect tea, and enjoy the ceremony around it. I also love the vibe of sharing tea with friends and strangers — I find it to be intimate in a way that alcohol and coffee are not. In my senior year of college, I even did a tea-related social experiment .\n\nI practice monogamy. As a rule, I don't really do 'casual' relationships, and the idea of seeing multiple at the same time gives me anxiety. I've been in two significant long-term relationships, each about 4 years long, and a few serious, shorter relationships. Ultimately, each relationship ended because we either grew apart or wanted different things.\n\nAs I've gotten more serious about dating, I've also become more picky. I still lead with my heart and don't care so much about your body or how you identify, but I do care about your values, habits, and goals.\n\nIn other words, I care about what you care about .\n\nI want my partner to value family. This starts with me and you, in addition to our respective families. That doesn't mean you need to have a great relationship with your family, but ideally you aspire to. I want kids, but I am open to adoption and fostering — I believe every kid deserves a loving home, and if/when I have the means, I'd like to find a way to open mine to those who don't have one.\n\nI want my partner to value community. Hopefully you care as much as I do about being an active member of your community and society at large. It doesn't matter if that means volunteering in a soup kitchen, working at a summer camp, running for office, or something else entirely, as long as you like to be involved in our world.\n\nI want my partner to believe in something. You should be generally optimistic about the future. I find nihilism and pessimism exhausting. Ideally, our beliefs are mostly the same, but it's more important that you arrived at yours independently and respect my own. You should also care about politics and social issues, possibly to the point of activism — I find this is a good proxy for people who care about society and their place in it.\n\nI want my partner to contain multitudes. I think it's important that no one belief or aspect of your identity should dominate your personality. Per Walt Whitman , I find the mark of maturity is the capacity to simultaneously hold a set of beliefs that are apparently contradictory.\n\nI want my partner to value health and fitness. This is a big part of my life, and it matters a lot to me that we both prioritize living a long, healthy life, for ourselves and as role models for future kids. To me, this looks like abstaining from smoking and addictive drugs, limiting alcohol consumption, and having a lifestyle oriented around being outside and moving your body.\n\nI want my partner to be ambitious. I actually prefer that it's not in the same way I am. It might be through your career — maybe you're a doctor, lawyer, artist, or are trying to effect change in the world through a newsletter you write. I think it's even possible to be ambitious about family. All that matters is that you have a growth-mindset, and happen to the world, rather than letting the world happen to you.\n\nI want my partner to be curious. I love learning about new things, and I want to share that with my partner. Maybe you value continued education, or read the news every day, or fall down wikipedia rabbit holes regularly. It doesn't matter really how you're curious — I just have a hard time relating to people who accept things at face value and don't ask \"why?\"\n\nI want my partner be well read. It could be pulp romance; I just think reading says something about your attention span, and demonstrates an interest in engaging with new stories or learning new things.\n\nI want my partner to be Jewish, but I'm open minded about this. I was not raised to be particularly religious, am not religious now, and don't believe in any conventional definition of God. I have also never adhered to Halakha . However, Judaism is important to me for three reasons:\n\nI want my partner to be my partner. While this may seem tautological, it's important to me that our relationship is a partnership where together we are greater than we are individually. We should contribute different things to the relationship, and support each other in our individual endeavors. We are a team — my success is your success, and vice versa. Instead of allowing adversity or conflict to come between us, we approach everything that comes up as us against the problem .\n\nI'm pretty open-minded about where life takes me long-term, so I hope you are too.\n\nEnneagram ( about )\n\nBig Five ( about )\n\nMBTI : EN(T/F)J ( about )\n\nI like the culture. I find the traditions very meaningful, and like that they've persisted over generations.\n\nI found a sense of belonging in the Jewish community, especially in my twenties, and especially in Israel.\n\nI find that this is a good (though imperfect) proxy for a set of ineffable values that matter to me in a partner.\n\nDating Profile JUN 2024\n\nAbout Me\n\nPersonality\n\nAbout You\n\nAbout Us\n\nPictures of Me"

      "fullText": "üh-hm. (means 'yep' with a kind of 'insightful' undertone)\n\nin case there is someone out there silly enough to be strong enough to be my man 🐻‍❄️ (apparently, this means polar bear in some dialects...)\n\nHallo, hallo. This is K speaking. (I'll tell you my name later, of course. Even my shoe size. Just not sure how this 'going public with loads of seriously personal' works yet...)\n\nI'd like to start with some controversies, if I may - they should tickle your interest buds, all being well.\n\nAnd there you go, the first one has just landed , and even without intent!\n\nI make up phrases in English sometimes, quite probably because it is my second language. But aren't your interest buds all the merrier now that they know they exist?!\n\nFor illustration ( though, a non-linguistic one ): photographic evidence of the moment when my nephew and I invented the 'simultaneous reverse swing selfie' 10 years ago.\n\n(I've made the whole sorcery into a 12\" video but this site wouldn't... so this is the end frame, as you can tell from the catharsis on our faces.)\n\nalrighty then, on with the controversies...\n\nI wasn't supposed to befriend because\n\nbut I've walked them for a friend with the greatest joy dozens of times\n\naaand I am allergic to dust 😩\n\nand while you might not get the sense instantly, I'll have you know that I've just done an online test and it says it is one of my signature strengths, OK?!\n\nI love dogs, horses and cats are OK, too, but if you have any of these living in your house, we'd be in a pickle...\n\nBut hey, don't write me down as 'the allergy girl'! I might be lactose intolerant and vegetarian, too, but no hayfever can sweep me off my feet!\n\nJokes aside (hope you've been having the time of your life so far), I'm a heterosexual female, 178 cm tall and 60 kg, give or take, and an atheist. I turned 40 three months ago, which feels so recent, but if you think about it, that's one Q already... 😶\n\nI live in London normally (but presently unemployed so sticking it out in a cheaper place) but if a job offer took me to Copenhagen, Stockholm or Amsterdam by any chance, I wouldn't weep my eyes out. (I love bikes and definitely prefer cycling to public transport... but not just for the bike culture, of course!)\n\nI work in project management in the creative industries but I've just completed a short course in environmental sustainability and oh my, there's just so much potential in so many areas of sustainable development! I firmly believe that if anything, technology and science will save humanity from exterminating this planet but there's so much everyone can do! I hope you agree with that and don't let climate despair get the better of you! I hate waste in any of its forms (materials, time, money, energy....). I wish I had the skills of a chemical engineer to invent more ways to upcycle/recycle waste. Or the powers of a social psychologist to ignite a grassroots movement that would turn overconsumption into something society would end up frowning upon and would eventually lead to global behavioural change... (My folks call me naive at least once a fortnight so it's OK if you think I'm a bit too far into wishful thinking, don't worry.) Lacking the skills of scientists, though, at least I have a skeleton idea of a dark comedy tv show (in terms of flavour, think of a layered cake of Boat Story, Back to Life, After Life, and, me, of course) that would stick it into the faces of local governments (and the main one) re how much more they could actually do (or try to do) to solve/ease a bunch of social and environmental issues at local levels. We'd be following the stumblings of a 40-something main character who is completely lost on the tracks of self-development (but sane, just kind of driftwood-ish a bit), and circumstances make him/her settle into a small town community, and we watch in awe how these stumblings sometimes turn into brilliant solutions to problems without the main character's slightest awareness of his/her role in them... anyway, I could go on but you'd need to sign an NDA. However, if you have any ties to Two Brothers Pictures or Harry Williams or Jack Williams (the two brothers) or their EAs or their PAs or their postman, get in touch this instant, of course! (Ricky Gervais' management agency I had tried already, the most junior of their junior staff bounced me off in a blink of an eye, albeit, politely 🙂 )\n\nBut yeah, if not changing the perception of the population about overconsumption and overproduction, there are still a billion things to try, right?! I did some decluttering a couple of months ago, took crates of items to a market with the intent of donating the proceeds to animal shelters. Luckily, I managed to sell a dozen items or so. Then winter came, the books got soaked right after unpacking one time so I took the whole thing online. I created a website, photographed hundreds of clothes, books, utensils, knick-knacks, and spent ages uploading and describing everything and getting word out on local social media... then 3 books and a cheesegrater got bought. But hey, the intent was there!\n\nThis spot is my favourite so far but I'm happy to go for an old Scandinavian villa on sale for peanuts with you, to do up while I can swim a lot and make lots of hot beverages for us. Or a Mediterranean little house? With colder drinks?\n\nAre you also scanning social media channels like cheappropertyeurope and such daily? (Ours will have solar panels and a heat pump and all the clever things, OK?)\n\nI asked a friend to describe me as this seems to be a frequent advice re dating profiles... so this is from her (and I am all blushing while typing): A clever introvert with such integrity but little confidence. She values tranquility over fanfare but she is all in for adventures and creating memorable experiences. Keeps lots of her ideas to herself despite being a creative person, possibly due to being afraid (that lack of confidence thing...). Intelligent, great sense of humour, quick on the uptake but a bit sceptical first about new things. Sometimes it takes a bit of letting guards down but after that she is a truly loyal, trustworthy friend, by your side through thick and thin. She is monogamous and would go for problem-solving without hesitation rather than throwing it all in way too soon. She expects honesty and loyalty in return as well: once trust is gone, it would be a rocky road winning it back.\n\nThe person who will fall for her (who will seriously want to make her happy) will get a most devoted wingman (woman), that's for sure. And the two of them will carry around laughing their heads off, probably. She is such fun when there's no need for walls.\n\nThere. Can you believe all that praise?! Embarrassingly lovely, isn't she? But she has known me since I was about 3 years old so... 😬 And you know me a little by now, too, don\"t you? - let's get pragmatic and avoid wasting each other's time (if that's the case) because wasting is so insanely stupid. I guess this aversion to waste accounts for my thriftiness and indecisiveness. For me it takes longer to decide on a purchase or an action plan than for most people - and if you are the kind of clever guy I'm after, it might have already clicked for you that what I'm trying to do with the best intentions is just another form of wasting, i.e. wasting time under the illusion that I'm working out the optimal usage of resources.... 🙃  how dumb, huh?! If you'd found me out, get in touch by all means. I could definitely welcome someone in my life who catches me out when I should be. And the best would be if you were patient and easy-going, too. Or just patient. I don't seem to be attracted to men with long hair and I am not keen on facial hair, either (I have a theory that circa 98.7% of men sporting a beard or a moustache would look incomparably more handsome without them. There's such a tiny segment of the male population who might actually benefit from growing facial hair that I could almost elevate this theory into a general rule. But I won't, cause I respect the rights of those 1,214 men to attractiveness.). I prefer not being taller, stronger, faster, fitter or heavier than my man. I'm not planning on having kids so it would be great if you didn't have/want any, either.\n\nI guess I am just writing this whole novella because I wonder if there's a chance after you have already lived half of your life to find someone who can add kindness and smiles to the remaining years while you want to add the same to theirs because you both understand how precious companionship actually is. Just looking for a team mate (whom I quite fancy), I reckon. You don't need to be a dashing prince with wealth or have a great sense of style but as long as your sense of humour is ace and you like to fool around while also being aware that no relationship can get far without respect or honesty and that maintenance on it will most probably be needed along the way, too, we could be in for something. Be old enough to know that you carry the responsibility for all you do and say but young enough to still want to venture out there and enjoy tomfoolery. (38-46 would cover that, you think?)\n\nloved it! (I mean, I didn't get the plane...)\n\nwith strangers who bring your food\n\nbut maaan, holding out your phone on a trike for a photo when there's absolutely nothing underneath is a thrill!\n\nis probably also expected... Serious face was art director's doing. Location global fashion giant's choice.\n\nis this a date-me-doc?!\n\nHere I come,\n\nReach me via this email if any of the above resonates\n\nI love hiking\n\nthese two loonies\n\nI am allergic to dogs\n\nbest sound and smell!\n\nI'm creative (in some ways)\n\ntime to get back to the allergies...\n\nDreaming of having a small abode right by a lake\n\nbirthday present\n\ngood to become friends\n\ndidn't get this aircraft, either\n\na full body shot\n\nseno.radsky@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "Dan\n\nI’m a brummie living in the capital. After some difficult times around the pandemic I decided to give my future prospects a boost by getting back into education. Currently I’m a freelance tutor. I teach guitar and English (eg GCSE, primary), and I hope to advance this through taking a degree in English. I’ve always written a lot, and studying at Kings’ College London under published academics, poets and novelists I hope to increase my chances of getting some additional work as a freelance writer, perhaps in journalism or educational texts. I write fiction and poetry too. I’m quite ambitious, and I like the idea of getting into something more scholarly, perhaps even lecturing. I’ve spent much of my life as a musician, but this is something I’m less interested in now, other than the professional tutoring I do.\n\nInterests and personality\n\nI enjoy reading. Some favourite books include The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K le Guin, Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernieres, Kafka on the Shore by Murakami, David Copperfield by Dickens, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, The Buddha of Suburbia by Hanif Kureishi, Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood, and The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy.\n\nI also read history - favourite periods/subjects so far include Soviet Russia, nineteenth century Europe, the French Revolution and World War II.\n\nThat’s all pretty heavy isn’t it…\n\nSo, in lighter news: I like having a laugh (despite having read books about the Soviet Union), and people say I’m funny (although you can be the judge of that). They’d probably also say I’m a sensitive soul (may as well confess this now), and it’s quite important to me to have long, deeper conversations with people. I could easily chat till 6am to people I click with. I don’t demand this of any prospective partner (!) but I don’t think it would work if our conversations lacked depth. Another thing people say of me is that I put people at ease.\n\nA few more things I enjoy\n\nWhat do I want from a relationship?\n\nCompanionship, fun, comfort, being challenged sometimes, sharing experiences. I love children, so I would like to have kids. I tend to be attracted to big personalities, or at least people who have their own deeper interests, whether that be professional or otherwise. I respect sincerity, but I don’t expect people to tell me everything about them from day one.\n\nDrop me an email if this is your thing (see above for my address).\n\nAge: 36\n\nHeight: 6’, 0”\n\nLocation: East London\n\nOccupation: Guitar tutor/English tutor/Student\n\nEmail: dansherid@gmail.com\n\nMusic: I like classical these days, a few fav composers include Beethoven, Chopin and Ravel. I also like arty rock, soul, jazz and ambient; a few artists I listen to/have listened to: Bowie, The Velvet Underground, Radiohead, Sonic Youth, The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Leonard Cohen, Antony and the Johnsons.\n\nWalking.\n\nFilms and drama: I like arthouse, sci-fi, comedy and more.\n\nTheatre (just getting into it).\n\nGeneral evenings out (although to be fair staying in with good company seems more and more appealing these days)."

      "fullText": "Last updated: 2023-12-27\n\nTLDR: 31-year-old monogamous straight man. SF Bay Area; not looking for a long-distance relationship. Software engineer. No kids, but I'll probably want kids someday. 6'1\" tall. Atheist. Politically liberal (but with a lot of nuance). Drink socially, no tobacco or drugs.\n\nI'm a thinker and a tinkerer: As a kid, I was addicted to LEGOs, but my meager allowance couldn't support my LEGO habit, so in my teens I switched to coding. In undergrad, I detoured into physics at Caltech; although I was an 'A' student, I decided research wasn't my passion, so I didn't pursue a PhD. I'm now an engineer at AI research lab Anthropic. (And I love my job!) I also dabble in electronics and 3D printing, leaving behind a trail of half-finished projects, as well as some finished ones .\n\nI love spending time with my friends, even if it's just casually chatting over dinner or hanging out on a friend's couch. I'm semi-introverted -- I get along fine with new people, but my \"social battery\" gets depleted after a few hours.\n\nA sample of things I enjoy: Bret Devereaux's history blog , Matt Levine on finance , Chemical Safety Board investigations , r/PixelArt , r/WholesomeMemes , r/Frogs (they're cute! 🐸). I'm more the \"academic\" kind of nerd than the \"Star Trek and D&D\" kind of nerd, but I get along well with the latter kind. I play video games occasionally, and when I'm having a bad day, my guilty pleasure is to binge-read terrible manga.\n\nI enjoy being out in nature, and I ride my bike along the Bay Trail on weekends. I like road trips, and my friends and I usually go on a road trip every winter. I kinda want to travel abroad more, but I'm not a fan of long plane flights.\n\nAlthough I'm financially stable, my ethos tends towards minimalism. I prefer not to own unnecessary things. I like mending worn clothes and fixing broken things. My apartment is tiny, clean, and cozy. I currently live alone, but I've had roommates in the past and really enjoyed it. Living with people is a great way to form a healthy and supportive community!\n\nThink we might be a good match? Send me an email with your own dating doc, or a photo + short bio. Mention this doc so I know you're not a spammer. I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nMy email: timmaxw @ (the super-popular email provider that starts with \"g\")\n\nFor a first date, I like a casual weekend coffee somewhere near SF, but I can be flexible.\n\nI know it can be really intimidating to reach out and contact a potential partner! I want you to know that you aren't bothering me, whether or not it turns out to be a good match. 🙂\n\nRelationships should be comfortable and fun! I want a relationship where I can be myself and my partner can be herself. Good communication and mutual emotional support are important.\n\nI love to cuddle. Physical touch is my love language.\n\nIn-depth conversations are my other love language. What exactly is a leap-second? Is a certain fractal space-filling? Why weren't language barriers a problem for Vasco de Gama's voyage to India? What will happen when AI can generate infinite seasons of your favorite TV show? (It's fine if your interests are different from mine; I want to hear about your interests too!)\n\nI prefer to build an emotional connection before having sex.\n\nI'm looking for a medium-or-long-term relationship. I think I'll eventually want to get married and have kids, but I'm not in any hurry.\n\nI'm looking for a partner who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area; I'm not interested in a long-distance relationship.\n\nAlso, I hope you like pictures of cute animals, because if we're in a relationship I'll text you pictures of cute animals randomly throughout the week. 🐱\n\nTim's Date-Me Doc\n\nPhotos\n\nAbout me\n\nWhat I'm looking for\n\nContact info"

I want to be better in all aspects of my life.\n\nA minimalist. I like to live a simple life enriched by experiences.\n\nAdventurous and spontaneous. I like to live in the moment and not be scared of uncertainty. Last year, I and a friend decided to do a road trip down south from NYC but after sitting in the car, we decided to go north. We ended up in Montreal when I had packed for Florida. Would definitely do it again.\n\nA believer in doing hard things often. I jumped on the cold shower bandwagon 3 years ago. It’s been great. Cold water beats caffeine by a mile.\n\nInterested in the outdoors. I like to hike, camp, backpack and summit mountains. Okay, full transparency I have only climbed one mountain but I liked it.\n\nInterested in building a community and living within walking distance from the people I love.\n\nlooking for a life partner and would like to have a monogamous relationship.\n\nlooking to have biological children.\n\nintellectually curious and is ready to put in the effort to make both of our lives better. I think wisdom is in realizing that nobody’s perfect and you have to put in effort in every aspect of life."

      "fullText": "39F, gay and gender non-conforming and in a monogamous relationship. Not interested in any romantic encounters. Looking for long-distance friendship in which we exchange long well-written e-mails in English and/or Russian about our subjective life experiences and how they relate to the world around us. My default mode in life is gawking, wide-eyed, at the insanity of the world around me and quietly muttering \"What the actual bloody fuck?..\" under my breath, and then trying to learn more about evolutionary biology to understand why on earth humans do these things they do. Poetry and logic both please. I want to connect with an actual human who is not hiding behind a wall of trite pleasantness and socially acceptable conversation topics. I want to talk about the meaning of life, existential dread, public policy, thermodynamics,  gyoza, your dog, shit we're going through rn and things like that. It doesn't always have to be profound; I will likely express a lot of banalities because sometimes banalities resonate. I love women, especially gay women, but you can be any age, gender and sexuality - if we click, we click. If we don't, at least we tried. I am weird and I don't click with a lot of people, so if we do click, it'll be a pleasant surprise.\n\nAbout me: fairly intelligent and nerdy in the sense of being academically oriented but not into typical nerd culture. Also I know as close to zero pop culture as literally anyone I've ever met. I likely have some  annoying combo of ASD, ADHD, GAD, depression and who knows what else but none of it is formally diagnosed and I have accumulated a heap of coping mechanisms; none are too effective but combined they allow to live a life that appears mostly normal from the outside. This is just so you're not surprised at my being one odd bird; otoh, this is Scott's blog, so you likely won't be to begin with.\n\ntkachira at gmx dot com\n\nAstral Codex Ten"

If you think we’d be a good fit, I’ve got my contact information at the bottom if you wanna say hi. If you’re not a single lady, I’d love it if you could share this with awesome women in your life that you think would be a good match ( I’ll make it worthwhile 😂 )!\n\nI’m Ujwal, an entrepreneur that’s passionate about learning and always growing in life. I enjoy finding ways to keep traditions from my culture & family alive while also having curated my own path, making sure to have balanced professional ambition and personal growth.

Love going to live events, especially sporting events.\n\nTravel: I do a lot of traveling – mostly all for leisure and some blended business & social trips to hang with friends. I also make the effort to see family as often as I can, locally or internationally. I value that I’ve created a life where I can travel in an instant, or stay months in a location while enjoying myself professionally & personally. Visited 6 continents in 2023!\n\nMoney: I live frugally on a modest salary that I haven’t changed in many years.

I'm Anna Crow/Anna Magpie, haven't settled on that yet, a 23-year-old trans woman living in the United Kingdom. As of writing this (1:17am BST, September 5th 2024) I am in the process of attempting to independently fundraise my salary so I can go to Stanford and run a longitudinal study monitoring tens of thousands of different biomarkers on people beginning, then throughout gender affirming hormone therapy, in order to begin to develop a foundational understanding of how to coordinate complex signaling pathways in real world biological systems.\n\nI am currently applying to computational biology PhDs mostly in/around London. My core interest is in understanding biology “across scales”. How do we integrate molecular biology data into a coherent whole in order to make useful predictions about disease, with a particular focus on aging. A subquestion I find particularly interesting is the extent to which regulatory networks are defined by complex, non-linear interactions vs simple additive ones. This question has big implications for combination therapies and, more generally, how fast we should expect biomedicine to progress.\n\nM y life is a little up in the air at the moment, I'm currently staying at CEEALAR, but hopefully moving to London sooner rather than later.\n\nPolyamorous by default. I want to have one or two people that I'm extremely special to, and as long as I feel special to someone I can't bring myself to care about whether they're having sex/romance with other people; monogamous relationships just sound like too much work.\n\nChronic infodumper, if we date, you can expect rambles on things like\n\nIf you also like these topics, that's great, but if not I'm probably happy to listen to you if you ramble as well.\n\nGenerally eclectic, very into HEMA (Historical fencing with an emphasis on the martial art), bouldering, hanging out in places which have neat people to talk to (hackerspaces, etc.), and photography, almost exclusively wildlife, but someday I'll get into astro (even if you don't do that part with me, it would be great if you accompanied me on the outdoor walks. You will learn about birds and you will enjoy it). I also like to read: Trying desperately to get out of the rationalist monoculture, so have picked up “An experiment in criticism by CS Lewis” and in the middle of “The guns of August”\n\nI have extremely strong feelings about moral responsibility and individual virtue, especially as they relate to interpersonal relationships. In general I think that the biggest distinction between me and others isn’t intelligence or aptitude, I just care more. I also value serious, precise thinking and try to be fairly ruthless about avoiding what I can best term “vibes based analysis” alongside discouraging it in others. I’ve deliberately cultivated an instinctual uneasiness about hard to falsify claims. I want to date someone who helps me to be a better thinker, a better truthseeker. Stress test my claims, point out when I'm being more of a soldier than a scout and judge me for it, etc.\n\nMy ideal partner would be someone kind, extroverted and intelligent, who likes when I ramble and can ramble back at me, and enjoys cuddling me and having me occasionally draped over their arm. You should be an independent thinker who tries to avoid uncritically reciting  recieved opinions. Ambitious or at least interested in improving yourself to a similar degree that I am, and willing to help me as I start assembling the life I want outside of university.\n\nThe tone of this document is possibly a little stand-offish, that's just my writing style. I am an extroverted, 6’5” trans woman with motor coordination issues; this makes me an inherently ridiculous person. I can't take myself too seriously. “Bouncy” probably captures my default orientation in most social settings. Again, go scroll through here for a much better sense of my demeanor\n\nhttps://x.com/WillowChem?t=22xAPEwWkuqYKqLvKf_l2w&s=09\n\nIf this sounds intriguing to you, the easiest way to get in touch is going to be discord or email Discord: aclockworkmagpie\n\nEmail: annacrow@proton.me\n\nBiology, especially cellular biology, the mechanisms of aging, and mathematical models of evolution. Evolution is a better engineer than you are and I will tell you exactly why\n\nMilitary history, I have a particular interest in the development of early semi-automatic firearms, and how this was influenced by institutional thinking around infantry doctrine. However I'm a modern warfare geek in full generality. Also I have strong opinions about people with strong opinions about the F-35.\n\nAquaculture and ornamental fish. I’m a keen tropical fishkeeper, although I haven't been able to pursue this seriously lately due to the housing constraints associated with being a student.\n\nAnna Crow\n\nTestimonials:"

      "fullText": "Table of contents\n\nI decided to use one of the Engineering solution templates from Notion, so my problem is figuring out how to use this without making people think I need a group of overpaid college graduates to fix me.\n\nBut really, my goal is to find a loving, rewarding relationship with a female I am interested in and for whom I am willing to sacrifice the time necessary to build a relationship. Someone who is kind, intelligent, silly, curious, courageous, and empathetic. And very importantly, someone who is emotionally mature enough to realize the kind of work and sacrifices that a relationship entails.\n\nI am pretty flexible about the actual location, since my job is usually remote. Buttt I am a sucker for good weather - I’ve lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and in Malaga, Spain for a little bit so I am not going to pretend that living in Norway would be perfect for me. But love transcends all, right? 😛 I’ll try to use some of the existing fields in this template that I find are surprisingly appropriate or just funny.\n\nIdeally - find someone who is compatible with me in a relationship sense by showing them this document and some pictures of me, at which point they will fall hopelessly in love.\n\nMeeting more guys. Just kidding! If you think we would be two cubes in an ice tray, regardless of what your gender is, then totally message me and we can haaanggg. See “Implementation and Rollout Plan” for contact details.\n\nMeet a lot more girls with the openness to a relationship or just a friendship depending on how we feel about each other. I see either as a win, but I want to be clear that my intention going into a meeting is 80% to date and 20% to be friends. To be clear, I love having a relationship that has the foundation of a friendship. But I am not sure how this is possible unless we read this doc, signed a binding contract to be friends, erased our memories, and then one day felt that we could be more.\n\nI think it’s easier going from “Ah I don’t see this working out as a relationship, but we can totally drink boba like every 5 weeks” rather than “Hey we drink boba like every 5 weeks, but I want to see you again tomorrow.”\n\nProgramming - I am a software engineer who has worked for blockchain companies (trading and gaming-related) and I am extremely grateful that I truly enjoy my work! I love building things with an end customer in mind and I find it awesome that solving cool problems can make peoples’ lives better. Somehow, I think the universe was beautifully designed that way.\n\nMath/Physics I kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world I have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation I used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\n\nI kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world\n\nI have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation\n\nI used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\n\nStrategy Games Really Like Catan (I love the 1v1 version of Colonist, I was ranked Diamond two seasons ago and btw the username is from Looking for Alaska by John Green haha) Secret Hitler Soccer Love/Hate Chess Tennis (love watching it though) Hate Uno (is this even strategy?)

Open to poly but prefer to meet a fellow undistracted single person.\n\nMy ideal situation would be a long-term relationship or permanent partnership, but not necessarily living together (I'm a bit of an ambivert and enjoy living alone in my condo, but love visiting others and having people over).  Living together isn't off the table, though!\n\nA perfect weekend night for me is rounding up a bunch of friends to go out to a great restaurant (I'm an omnivore foodie who loves to share dishes, it'd be nice if you were, too), and then seeing a great movie at the theater (and I am highly skilled at ferreting out the latter; I like to snobbishly say that my favorite genre is \"quality.\").  Or maybe doing those things in reverse order so we can discuss the movie after!\n\nOn that subject, the most recent movie I watched was a second viewing of Everything Everywhere All at Once, which is one of the best movies I've seen in the last ten years and sublime as a repeat experience.\n\nI'm not especially outdoorsy and actively anti-woodsy, but I loved the crew rowing class I took last year and it'd be cool to get back into it (I am currently contenting myself with my WaterRower and occassionally delivering evil monologs straight to camera (and it would be neat if you get that reference.).).\n\nMuch more information, photos, and a couple of highly-themed metaphor and pun-filled personal ads can be found on my Fetlife profile, username \"TheStoryGirl.\"  Direct email is christinathestorygirl at gmail dot com.\n\nInterested\n\nAstral Codex Ten"

I’m currently trying to figure out how to convert part of my apartment into a robotics lab!\n\nBlogging - I started this a few months ago. So far I’ve mostly been writing about forecasting / prediction markets, but there’s a bunch of other random stuff I’d eventually like to write about\n\nI’m interested in pretty much anything adjacent to science, technology, politics, economics, progress, “ideas”, philosophy, … I have more of a problem sticking to any particular project because I’m interested in too much stuff versus not having enough ideas for interesting things to do\n\nWatching sports, especially NFL, NBA, and Golf (but really anything). Go Packers!\n\nWatching TV shows and movies\n\nExercise - I lift weights and/or run most days\n\nPlaying sports - I enjoy pretty much anything, but especially basketball\n\nOutdoors stuff - camping, hiking, biking, etc. My family has done a bunch of road trips to different parts of the country, mostly visiting national parks / outdoors places and I definitely want to do more of that in the future. I’ve been to 46/50 states!\n\nExploring different cities\n\nCooking - I got really interested in cooking a few years ago and I really enjoy it (and I’m pretty good at it now!)\n\nRelaxed, low-stress person. Rarely get really high/low emotionally\n\nGoofy, although it takes a bit for me to get comfortable enough around people to let this side of my personality out\n\nFairly quiet / introverted,  especially around people I don’t know well.

This is a guiding principle when making big life decisions\n\nI agree with the basic ideas behind effective altruism, i.e. that we should try to be strategic about how we “do good” in order to maximize impact and that people far away matter as much as people close by\n\nI also want to be happy myself! Lately I’ve been trying to get better at building and maintaining relationships with friends and family. I’ve become increasingly convinced that strong social connections are the key to happiness\n\nReligion: Agnostic. I was raised Catholic, but stopped believing sometime during high school. I miss the community and ritual that went along with being religious though. (I would be okay dating someone religious if my agnosticism wouldn’t be a problem to them)\n\nPolitics: liberal - I agree with most of the ideas outlined here\n\nI think I can accomplish a lot and feel compelled to try and have a big positive impact on the world. I’m not totally sure of what the best way is for me to do this, but it’s my main overarching life goal\n\nI'm looking for\n\nInterests & Hobbies\n\nPersonality\n\nValues\n\nGoals/Ambitions"

You wouldn't notice me walking down the street (unless it's summer and I'm enjoying a barefoot day).\n\nI love to learn, and I love puzzles.

I would also characterize spirituality as balance, or having a low (mental) center of gravity. I don't follow any specific tradition, but once in a while I will come across a text from some writer , poet , philosopher , thinker , or ancient figure which will speak to me in that way.\n\nI enjoy connecting people who share similar interests (philosophy, spirituality, programming) and have either maintained or created small communities of interest everywhere I've lived for the last few years.\n\nI'm vegetarian for 10+ years.\n\nYou can send me an email at [email protected] .\n\nLINK\n\nYou are about to visit a link which has been flagged with the above content warnings.

I made this page to help change that.\n\nI'm 42, 6'4\", and date women. I've never been\n    married, but I'd like to change that. No kids yet, but I very much want\n    them.\n\nI'm looking for a committed relationship. I'm open to\n    standard monogamy or (once we've built a strong, loving foundation)\n    something more monogamish.\n\nI'm ethnically Jewish (50% Ashkenazi) and love the culture, but I wasn't raised with any religion and don't practice any now.\n\nMy home is in Somerville, MA and I'm pretty planted here.\n    Last year, I bought a lake house with my family. We're there almost every\n    weekend in the summer, and it's made our already-close relationships even stronger.\n\nI'm, uh, on the left.\n\nBelow you'll find more about my family (they're wonderful), my work (software company co-founder, now doing passion projects), my singing (barbershop quartet, symphony chorus), what I appreciate in a partner, and how to get in touch.\n\nBottom left (2021)\n\nI won the family lottery. It's almost certainly the best thing about my life.\n\nI have a younger brother who lives nearby and is one of my favorite people. He's married with a young son and daughter. I knew I would enjoy being an uncle, but I'm liking it even more than expected. I almost can't talk about my niece and nephew without smiling.\n\nMy parents also live nearby. My mom is smart and warm, and my dad is ridiculously handy and protective of his people.\n\nThey're a very welcoming group. We're all excited to integrate my eventual partner into the crew.\n\nThese kids are so cute it's criminal to have to blur their faces.\n\nI'm the co-founder of a software company I started in 2018 with two friends. It went really well! This year, my co-founders and I put new leaders in place and stepped away from day-to-day operations.\n\nI'm lucky enough that I don't currently need a day-job, so I spend most of my time pursuing passion projects. Lately, I've been getting rather involved in local politics (I recently hosted a mayoral debate in my city!) and building a community called Fractal Boston . Fractal is a group of friendly, ambitious people who eat dinner together every Sunday and help each other grow.\n\nOne of the things that brings me the most joy in life is singing.\n\nI was fortunate to be raised by musical parents who encouraged me to join choruses at an early age. Thanks to them, I've been singing in some ensemble or another for ~30 years.\n\nCurrently, I sing with the Tanglewood Festival Choir, which performs with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\n\nBefore that, I sang in a barbershop quartet for 10 years alongside my brother. I miss that group a lot and hope to start a new quartet someday.\n\nI've had so many rich experiences in those groups, and I'd love to tell you about them in person.\n\nBut for now, here's a little glimpse of my quartet at one of our coolest gigs:\n\nMy quartet singing the National Anthem at Fenway Park. (2016)\n\n(Just some rough ideas. Naturally we're going to come up with our own list.)\n\nIf you think we might be a match, I'd love to hear from you: ben@benorenstein.com\n\nPlease don't feel like you need to include as many details as I have here. However, I'd appreciate it if you included at least some basics and a few photos. If you have links to online presences that I can check out, that'd be great too.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon! :)\n\nYou're emotionally warm and have nurturer energy. You have a ton of love to give, and are excited about receiving it as well (I'm very affectionate and always have been).\n\nYou think we'd be good at making each other laugh. I seem to value having a funny partner more than most. I've found it makes life so much more enjoyable. I love quick-wittedness and callbacks. These days, I most enjoy the comedy of Shane Gillis, Taylor Tomlinson, Mike Birbiglia, Jordan Jensen, Tom Segura, and Bo Burnham.\n\nYou're excited to start having kids in the next couple years (after dating, marriage, and at least one serious adventure). You’re excited to start having kids in the next couple years (after dating, marriage, and at least one serious adventure). Becoming a father is very important to me, and I’m open to a few different paths to get there — ideally having biological kids together, but I’d also consider options like surrogacy or adoption if that’s something we both feel good about.\n\nYou’re excited to start having kids in the next couple years (after dating, marriage, and at least one serious adventure).\n\nBecoming a father is very important to me, and I’m open to a few different paths to get there — ideally having biological kids together, but I’d also consider options like surrogacy or adoption if that’s something we both feel good about.\n\nYou're willing to live near Boston most of the time This is a pretty hard deal-breaker for me.

That said, if there's a part\n            of the world that's important to you to be in, I'm down to live\n          there some of the year! (Want to get away from New England winters, for example?

This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.\n\nAnubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of Hashcash, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.\n\nUltimately, this is a placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.\n\nPlease note that Anubis requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like JShelter will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such plugins for this domain.\n\nSadly, you must enable JavaScript to get past this challenge. This is required because AI companies have changed the social contract around how website hosting works. A no-JS solution is a work-in-progress.\n\nProtected by Anubis From Techaro .

      "fullText": "😍 Hi there! Welcome to my Date Me doc, which I must admit feels a bit charmingly low-tech in this Tinder age but hopefully in a cute we-bumped-each-into-each-other-at-the-online-coffeeshop kinda way. I'm Connie, a 33-year-old Chinese American techie person happily settled now in SF* after many years of wandering, Odysseus-style, through half the hokiest small towns in the US. I'm short, monogamous, and usually dressed in an alarmingly varied array of colors:\n\n(me, doing things)\n\n(me, still doing things)\n\n(me, doing something I will definitely never do again)\n\nI'd regale you with tales of my wanderings, but they're honestly quite boring and involve a lot of pet lab mice and early internet fanfic for some reason. The gist of it is that some combination of temperament, parental upbringing, and early Shounen Jump issues led to the dorky, egregiously friendly Huffleclaw you see before yourself today. In my bursts of social fancy I love flittering around novel/weird/interesting-sounding events, philosophy salons, and mysterious houseparties in the Bay, but I'm really an introvert at the core who likes to sun by big windows and nerd out on whatever topic has struck her this week (in my previous life I was definitely a cat, just one of those weirdo bodega ones that like people :P).\n\nI recharge my batteries on all the cozy things - longreads, podcasts, indie movies, coffeeshops and kava bars, bookshops with that old-book smell and perky plants, dinner parties, morning runs by the water and game nights with friends - but will absolutely get hype for the periodic rave, music festival, or good-lord-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into party. I'm high on the openness scale and enjoy poking at new things - even (especially) if they sound a bit out of my comfort zone - though my hope this year is to run around a little less, figure out the things I really care about, and go all in on the people and pursuits that matter to me. Who knows? That could be you 😉\n\nA few pluses about me:\n\nno kids, debt, or crazy exes\n\nlikes doing dishes and laundry because that's podcast time 👌\n\nprefers homey restaurants over fancy ones so cheap date\n\nDate Me! <3"

      "fullText": "I'm a straight man, years old.\n\nI live an intense, largely ascetic, life, focused on altruistic work, self-improvement, and personal-spiritual integrity.\n\nI'm looking to go on dates with new people, with the possibility of long or medium-term partnership. I'm open to both monogamous and polyamorous relationships.\n\n(More photos here .)\n\nI’m attempting to live with an open heart , robust ethics, and scrupulous epistemic standards.\n\nI want relationships, romantic or platonic, that are about helping me become wiser, more competent, and more ethical, and/or helping people who I like and respect become better by their own lights.\n\nMy favorite people tend to be extremely hardcore Effective Altruists, monastics that have sworn a vow of service to all life, and highly emotionally-attuned vegan therapists.\n\nI'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship:\n\nCurrently, I’m mainly looking for more companionship in my life.\n\nI would like to have someone to spend time with about once a week: talking, circling, cuddling, having sex, being curious together, all with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other about our desires and our relationship.\n\nThis kind of relationship amounts to approximately what poly people call a \"secondary partnership\": emotionally intimate, but not the primary structure of one's life. This might work best for someone who already has a primary partner, or who is otherwise committing most of their energies to a high intensity project.\n\n( This somewhat-out-of-date document gives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)\n\nIn the long run, I would like to find a spiritual collaborator *, for the other half of an altruistic power couple .\n\nI want a Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom, and who will mutually support me in doing the same. A relationship in which we work together, train together, rest together, and help each other to live in integrity with our values. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time working , and almost no time on conventional leisure activities (like watching movies together or going to parties).\n\nWhen I've dated people in the past, I've spent a lot of time and attention trying to help them get better. For example, having long conversations (or writing personalized essays) to convey the blindspots I observe in my partner's in-practice philosophy, or working with her to triangulate her skill gaps and to develop practice exercises that address them. Ideally, I'd like a partner who orients towards me and and my weaknesses in a similar way—actively looking out for the things that I'm missing, then helping me to see them, understand them, and improve them—with skill and compassion.\n\nI have been seeking something like this since I was 15. It’s one one of the desires that I hold closest to my heart. But, at this point, I’m mostly not expecting to find/develop this kind of Partnership, at least before the singularity. Currently, I am constructing a life in which I can learn, and get better, and execute effectively, without the support of a life partnership. But at the same time, I'm also keeping out feelers in case an extremely compatible woman, who is also living this kind of life, crosses my path.\n\n(Some more operationalization of what this kind of relationship might look like here .)\n\n* - To be clear, I am an atheist and an antitheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are beyond the reach of God . But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.\n\nI’m often happiest when I’m working, and when my life is going well, I work a lot. Most days, I’m working, or explicitly resting , from 30 minutes after waking up to shortly before sleep (with a daily break for intense exercise). I structure my day to maximize my energetic amplitude , so that to a first approximation, I’m either intensely alert and focused, or napping, but rarely in a middling state. I aggressively optimize for excellent sleep .\n\nI very rarely socialize outside of work. When I see my friends, it's almost always for one of us to help the other think through a personal problem. I eat one meal a day (most frequently kale, sauteed in olive oil, with toasted tofu). I only very occasionally watch movies or TV, and generally set myself up to avoid passively consuming content (eg I write at least one sentence about every piece I read).\n\nOutside of my core altruistic projects, I spend time exercising , reading (mostly AI stuff, history books, sometimes textbooks), writing blog posts , and sometimes hacking on small software projects . On the scale of months, I’m often doing some progression of deliberate self-development : identifying a pressing skill gap, and then iteratively designing and doing exercises to develop the relevant subskills. I review anki most days.\n\nMost weeks, I take off one day (and one evening) to rest, decompress, and do whatever feels most nourishing. Some rest day activities include: journaling, reading, writing, strength training, cleaning up my room, singing and memorizing folk songs (while walking around the neighborhood), going to the dog park to spend time with the dogs, meditating. When I’ve had a partner, I’ve enjoyed cuddling with her.\n\nWhen I have the capacity to take time off from work, I like doing doing various kinds of workshops and trainings, especially those that give me experience with interesting psychological states or faculties: meditation , improv , therapy techniques , etc. (I don't do drugs, though.)\n\n(Additional detail on my weird, intense, lifestyle can be found here .)\n\nOut of a combination of personal inclination and moral commitment, I work a lot. I'm genreally at the office almost all my waking hours, 6 days a week (and usually for a few hours on my rest day, as well).\n\nAnyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with me working that, either because you have a similar orientation to the world themselves (maybe we can spend time coworking together?), or because you’re comfortable with a relationship that is emotionally intimate without being time-intensive.\n\nThe thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty.\n\nI've sometimes been in a context where there was a forbidden conversation , some true fact, or some belief I held, that I didn't feel free to acknowledge . In a situation like this, I feel pressure to pretend about, or distract from, or downplay the thing.\n\nI’ve come to think that I can’t build a robust relationship on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.\n\nCreating those kinds of contexts by merely intending to be honest isn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't do undue harm.\n\nI make explicit considered effort in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback) in a way that the other party can hear it without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, Nonviolent Communication , rationality , and circling skill.\n\nBut even so, I am not a master at this. I still sometimes find myself in situations where there's something that feels too awkward to share even in otherwise candid relationships. I need help to maintain this kind of connection.\n\nIt is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward. This is crucial for me in an intimate relationship.\n\nRelatedly, relationships with me typically involve a lot of “meta”: doing checkins, talking about the relationship and how it is or isn't working, flagging frictions and generating creative solutions together, investing effort trying to improve our communication processes, etc.\n\nSome past partners have found this onerous or annoying. “Can’t we skip all the process talk, and just do the cool things that the relationship is about?” I don’t see it that way. Much of what I care about in a relationship is the strength of the relationship itself, and this sort of meta and process-iteration is a means to that.\n\nCompletely unironically, leaving comments on my relationship-communication google docs is one of my love languages. (The google doc format is optional. That's just a communication method that has worked well for some past partners.)\n\nI'm dispositionally monogamous, generally preferring to commit to only one person. However, I am happy to date people who have other partners themselves, especially if I can see that that makes them happy.\n\nI have only ever seriously dated one person at a time, and incidentally, I have only ever seriously dated people who were poly. (Effectively, I was monogamously partnered with someone who was dating other people.)\n\nI am more than willing to participate in a fully-monogamous partnership, if we're a good fit. I've dated poly people, not because I particularly prefer poly, but because the people I've been interested in have been poly.\n\nRaising kids appeals to me, but I’m not currently planning around having a family in the pre-singularity. However, I would do that if I found a highly compatible partner and having kids was important to her.\n\nThat is to say, I am open to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.\n\n(I might actively seek out a partner for raising a family after humanity is out of the acute risk period and life extension is solved.)\n\nSex is more important to me in the case of a once-or-twice-a-week companion than in the case of a committed Partnership. The point of having a capital-P partnership is mostly to help each other be better. For that, sex can be nice, but it isn't necessary. In the case of a more casual relationship, sexual and intimate emotional satisfaction is a larger fraction of what I care about.\n\nI’m interested in doing deliberate practice to get good at sex: focusing on my partner’s experience, with ample verbal and nonverbal feedback (plus after-action debriefs). It would obviously be better to do this with an emotionally-intimate partner, but I'm potentially open to trying with someone who I'm not otherwise dating, if we can establish really good communication and clarity about expectations first.\n\nI'm vegan (with some caveats ). So far, 100% of the people that I've dated seriously and 100% of the people that I've ever been in love with have been vegan. This is mostly correlation—the sort of people that I tend to be attracted to tend to be vegans. But it's also causal—I care about the ethics of the people I spend time with. For most people, eating factory farmed meat is the habit that causes the most direct harm to others. (Additionally, seeing someone eat meat tends to reduce my level of attraction for them.)\n\nI'm not confident, but I think I probably don't want to date people who aren't vegetarian, or who aren't otherwise careful about the externalities their life has on animals in factory farms.\n\nI'm not listing this as a firm deal-breaker, but it is important to me. If you eat factory farmed meat, and we get moderately far into dating, I'll want to have an honest and reasoned conversation with you about the ethics and tradeoffs involved.\n\n(I'm conscious that abstaining from animal products entirely is not a healthy choice for some people, and that there are additional tradeoffs.)\n\nFriend 1: \"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”\n\nFriend 2: \"Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at.\"\n\nFriend 3: “Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”\n\nIf any of the above sounds interesting to you, or even if you just want to say hi, \npress this button to tell me your name and a few sentences about you (or just email me here ). Maybe we can meet up the next time\n\t\twe're in the same metropolitan area.\n\nI'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. In an important way , your \n\tdoing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you.\n\nIf you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, you might explore the rest of this site, particularly the public statements page , or flip through my blog and/or archived twitter threads .\n\nIf you’re not a good match with me (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed, \n\tyou can help by connecting me with thoughtful single (or non-polysaturated) women who want the sort of thing that I want. If you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my gratitude .\n\na low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the one hand,\n\nand a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the other.\n\nDating Profile\n\nWhat I Want\n\nThe life I'm living\n\nConstraints and relationship-essentials\n\nSome friends' descriptions of me:\n\nIf you want to say hello...\n\nAid my quest!\n\nWeekly-ish companionship\n\nHigh-intensity Partnership (with a capital P)\n\nWork\n\nHonesty\n\nMeta\n\nRelationship style\n\nKids\n\nSex\n\nVegetarianism"

He genuinely wants to be there for other people. I’ve seen him show so much openness to emotional connection in times when even other resilient and emotionally mature people would have been inclined to take a step back from their existing relationships. I’ve never seen stonewalling or apathy from him. Quinn always cares, and is excited to show that he cares. If you have the same love languages as Quinn, he’ll be able to make you feel super special. Being there for other people and caring doesn’t just mean caring about his friends or partners—he also shows up for communities. At a party, he’s either the host or the guy you assume is the host because he introduces a new burst of energy to each room he’s in.\n\nQuinn also has a super strong sense of self; he won’t passively fall into trends. I’ve never heard him be insincere or mocking. When so much media and so many conversations contain at least a little bit, and sometimes a lot, of mockery, Quinn has a refreshingly firm focus on topics where he can be completely sincere. Basically, it feels like the idiom “big-hearted” was invented to describe Quinn.\n\nSincerity : Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness.\n\nAnalyticalness : My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that.\n\nConviction : Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean loyalty to convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments.\n\nCompassion : I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others.\n\nAmbition : I want to be with goal-directed people.\n\nIntrospectiveness : There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up.\n\nAn ex once reported that I'm \"really gung ho about the mortifying ordeal of being known\".\n\nI've been known to run taco nights at my house.\n\nSwam from alcatraz to SF.\n\nReally psyched about work, generally enjoy being someone who works a lot. Ask me about my subsubfield of preventing AI from causing my death.\n\nAsk me about my subsubfield of preventing AI from causing my death.\n\nAlmost entirely vegetarian.\n\nBaby fever, but don't do a lot of thinking about my parenting values because I'd rather do that thinking as a group project with a special someone.\n\nOften singing and humming, hopefully a turning a loved one's name into song.\n\nI have at least two mysterious backstories.\n\nYes the kidney tshirt is real.\n\nOne secret zest for life / high hedonic setpoint trait/behavior that it'd be more fun to surprise you with.\n\nFic/media: mostly scifi and fantasy. Music: metal, prog, jazz.

I roughly think embryo selection is more important than buying a house, but open to discussion.

Instead of swiping you could search . The compatibility score meant something . You could just send people messages (ok maybe that part wasn’t so great for everybody).\n\nThen something(s) happened and online dating stopped working.\n\nOne of those “somethings” was that we got older. Older and somewhat jaded, in my case. And if not exactly less attractive, then at least more of an acquired taste.\n\nAlso there was the rise of the Tinder Clones (of which OKC is now one of the worst). Also Instagram filters and Snapchat lenses. Also, you know, a pandemic.\n\nAnd so here we are a decade later writing bespoke “Date Me” docs, God help us.

      "fullText": "[Hello! I'm leaving this page up for posterity and those curious about things like this, but am removing it from my site's header as I am now in a relationship with someone.\n\n(And yes, they're someone who filled the form out :) )\n\nGood luck to everyone else out there looking for love!]\n\n(I have testimonials now!)\n\nJanuary 1st marked the start of my newest season , Romance. Overall my life is pretty fantastic, but I'm still looking for a long-term relationship, preferably on my way to marriage and at least one bio-kid within the next couple years. So I picked this season to really commit to that goal in every way I could think of, which includes things like just, you know, openly saying  to everyone who might find me interesting \"Hey, I'm single and looking to date\" and seeing what happens.\n\nSo if you're here, maybe you're interested in me based on my writing, or passions for rationality and psychology and fiction. If so, great! Those are things I enjoy talking about, so we'd probably get along well.\n\nThe quickest way to my heart, however, would be if you're into some combination of rationality, video games, or writing. I say that because I've always been a very \"activities oriented\" boyfriend.  I enjoy cuddling together with a pair of books or watching a show, but everyone I've fallen in love with was through either playing games together, or co-writing/RP, or debating intellectual or philosophical topics.  If the idea of spending hours doing those things makes you happy, then there's a good chance we'll be able to make each other happier together than we would be apart.\n\nThe other thing that matters a lot to me is personal development. I feel deeply driven to constantly learn, grow, and improve myself in every way I can.  That's not to say I'm \"Type A,\" since there are plenty of days where I just chill and have fun, and girlfriends have said they find me relaxing to be around. But if I notice something isn't working for me or those I care about, I want to improve it, and I'm pretty agentic in doing so.\n\nAll of which is to say, I want someone who wants to be that way too, and puts the effort in to learn how, both by improving epistemics and on the instrumental level of active problem solving. Someone who will be happy to help me improve more than I could on my own, and is looking for someone to do the same for them.\n\nIf you think that describes you, feel free to fill out this form and we'll see what happens!\n\nIf you already know me and are worried about \"ruining the friendship,\" I can promise with very high confidence that won't happen. If you're worried about looking foolish if you try and fail, I can also promise that I'll always have nothing but respect for people who show vulnerability to reveal who they really are.\n\nI am doing this, after all ^_o\n\n(Also, I'm willing to relocate for romance if things work out well. Meanwhile we can get to know each other online, and since I work remotely, I'm happy to do short or long visits to spend time together if we hit it off!)\n\nPokemon: TOoS\n\nRationally Writing\n\nBlog\n\nStories\n\nSupport\n\nDate Me"

      "fullText": "Author : Mati Roy | Created : 2021-12-10 | Updated : 2022-12-01\n\n2023-02-14 Update :\n\nOther relevant writings :\n\nBounty: 3,500 USD\n\nI'm offering 2,000 USD for someone I end up consensually being a legal parent with who you’ve\n    introduced me to and who wasn’t already a prospect. If someone reached out to me as a result of you sharing my\n    profile on social media, that counts too. Paid only for my first child.\n\nMy good friend Alton offered an additional\n      1,000\n      USD to support me ❤️ – ze said:\n\nI'll add $1000 to the bounty for the referral of someone who is with you and brings you a lot of joy for 18+\n      months\n      because I love celebrating love. I'd want to have the option to have a 2 hour call with you both at that time\n      window\n      as a strong preference but not necessary.\n\nMy friend Toli also offered an additional 500 USD to support me ❤️ – ze said:\n\nI will 50% match that bounty ($500) with the same conditions 🙂 I don't know Mati *that well* (yet). But very much\n      interested in seeing him find a partner and taking apart how he did it\n\nHere's Toli's own bountified dating profile (with a much larger bounty ^_^).\n\nA few more notes:\n\nWhile I’m open to other types of relationships, this profile is written with the goal of finding someone/people to\n    raise children with. I'm 32 years old (born in October 1990).\n\nI invite you to be yourself. I encourage you to not avoid doing anything you want to do in relation to me just\n    \"because it's weird\".\n\nFeel free to use Reciprocity to see if we\n    match, or just reach out to me\n    directly.\n\nThere’s some information I like to have about prospects early on that might be easier to do in a survey format, or\n    at least just so you know some specific explicit questions I generally have, you can see my Date me survey . Feel free to be very explicit and to the point with\n    me (or not). You can send me your own questions.\n\nHere are some more pictures: https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7 .\n\nI measure 188 cm (6'2) and weigh 87.1 kg (192 lbs).\n\nI’m open to various structures, although I prefer if most of the relationship energy goes towards the family.\n\nI’m panromantic. I’m generally much more sexually attracted towards females. Romantic and sexual attraction is a\n        plus.\n\nI would like a partner with whom I can connect deeply , know each other very well and develop\n        great models of each other, share about what's going on in our lives, and be open about our internal\n        experiences. Provide support in each other's goals and aspirations, have each other's back, and deeply trust\n        each other, and care about each other. Giving each other's affection.\n\nBe a team working together . Defaulting to assuming any issues that might arise isn't being done\n        maliciously, and being comfortable bringing them up and collaboratively working on them. Being resilient, and\n        working hard to address any potential issues. Trying hard to not split / live separately while raising children.\n        Ideally being open to being lifelong partners, and if distance (emotional, physical, etc.) became wanted, still\n        remain there for each other.\n\nSpending time together . In terms of spending time together, I might lean towards spending a bit\n        less time together than the median couple. I like spending time with a partner by working on common projects,\n        talking about our day, cuddling, messing around, sharing meals, and doing exercise / sports. I\n        don’t like to go out regularly, but maybe it’s because I just haven’t found the right activities.\n\nReviews . I’ve had some reviews which I think\n        are relevant here. I also had a very public relationship with Carissa , so checking our posts could give you some peak\n        into what being with me is like.\n\nValues . I’m a very principled person. Honesty is very important for me. In terms of moral\n        philosophy, I’m leaning towards deontological-threshold negative preference-weighted life utilitarianism.\n\nCommunication style . I lean ask/tell culture. I’m rather\n          good at guess culture , and like using it sometimes, but it’s important to me that my partner is able to\n        make their needs known explicitly if I fail at reading them, and be okay with me doing the same. I want someone\n        that is open to receiving feedback — I personally love feedback. I strongly dislike “deny culture” — where\n        someone says something that I need to deny, instead of asking me. I’m leaning more towards cold culture .\n\nFun . I like adventures and challenges. Not that I do those a lot, but I love them when I do.\n        Illustrative examples: I find it exhilarating to sleep naked in a cold forest, and I love doing DIY Impractical\n        Jokers ( this one\n          about dating profile 😅), exploring abandoned buildings, and doing food fights^^ I\n        generally like going\n        out of my comfort zone and trying new things. I like roleplaying. I like creating things.\n\nVibe . I'm often told I have a calming effect. I can inhabit other vibes, but I often inhabit\n        that one.\n\nHabits . I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t smoke. I don’t take any drugs.\n\nKnowledge (outside profession). I’ve read a fair amount about topics related to economics,\n        moral philosophy, futurism, effective altruism, LessWrong, rationality, and transhumanism.\n\nConflict resolution . Here are some\n          strategies I like to use .\n\nVideos . Here are recent videos of me: discussion with Malcolm , circling , more circling , authentic relating games (biased sample\n        based on what\n        tends to be streamed).\n\nOkCupid Questions . I’ve answered many OkCupid questions — most of them are\n        very old and a lot aren’t up-to-date, but you can still check them out.\n\nMore . To know more about me, I invite you to go the traditional route – ie. stalking me; wait,\n        no, I mean 1 on 1 interactions :P. You can easily stalk me though; I notably have a lot on Facebook and on my\n        website ( https://matiroy.com ) – feel free to send a friend request. You can\n        answer this survey to let me know other information you would like me to include on this profile.\n\nI have a medium preference to work towards a US citizenship (ie. I’m Canadian).\n\nI would prefer to live in Central or North America longterm, but short-term I'm more flexible.\n\nI'm totally okay with meeting remotely. I can also easily travel around, and will be travelling in the US\n        starting in April.\n\nI would like to have children using embryo/gamete selection. Can I pitch you the idea? It'll be a fun conversation if nothing else^_^\n\nI’m fertile: I’ve done a semen analysis and\n          donated sperm leading to 3 live births .\n\nI’m also open to using surrogates — I think it could actually be valuable to have 2 (or more) children at a time.\n\nI want at least 2-4 children , but my desire for the number of children scales almost linearly\n        with wealth, so I would like it if having 6+ children was on the table.\n\nI would like to share responsibilities ~equally related to taking care of our children (money, time, etc.).\n\nI would like to have an au pair, nanny, and/or live-in maid, unless we’re more than 2 parents / adults raising\n        our children.\n\nI have a predisposition towards liking giving a lot of autonomy / independence / responsibilities to children.\n\nI think it makes sense to give children the option to homeschool if/when they seem sufficiently\n        autonomous and if/when we have the capacity to support that. I can also see traditional schooling, boarding\n        schools, and other options being more valuable depending on our situation. I care about providing the tools for\n        our children to be successful.\n\nJust like I record all my life, I would like to record all the life of our children , at least\n        in some ways at least until they can make their own decision (because I think this might be important for identity\n          preservation , as well as useful for other reasons ). I would like to\n          sign up our children for cryonics .\n\nI would like our children to learn English as a first language. I might speak to them in French\n        so they also know French.\n\nI don’t mind whether you or our children eat animal products, at least until they can make their own choices\n        (I’m just mentionning that in case you know I have an bivalvegan diet and you were wondering).\n\nYou can see my resume for information on my career.\n\nI often think in terms of ROI when I spend money. I like saving a lot because of the power of\n          compounding investments .\n\n(Which also corresponds to my personality.)\n\nMain traits I generally like (sort of in order):\n\nWe were featured in the New York Times for our dating bounty story. Check out my AMA on the topic.\n\nCarrie won the $1,500 dating bounty for causing me to meet Carissa by sharing my dating profile on zir Facebook wall. Ze donated the bounty to the Foresight Institute . We've been together since April 5th, 2022.\n\nCheck out our story on YouTube . And follow Carissa on Facebook or Instagram for frequent updates on us ☺️.\n\nI'm very grateful for my friends Alton and Toli for adding this dating bounty to my initial parenting bounty! Check out Toli's own dating profile/bounty ! (And let us know if that causes you to date 😄)\n\nAnd let me know if you have a bounty of your own so I can help you, and add it here if you want 🙂\n\nMy current lifeplan\n\nSperm donor profile\n\nIntroductions can be done through any channel .\n\nI can stop taking new submissions for this bounty at any time (but, obviously, not retroactively).\n\nThe money is to incentivize you to take the time to read my profile and recommend me to friends, and to\n      generally reward superconnectors which I think tend to be undervalued. The money is just a bonus on top of the\n      gratitude^_^\n\nHonest\n\nValues living\n\nTruth-seeking; self-reflective\n\nProductive\n\nEmotionally stable; regulate their anger\n\nMentally healthy, low addiction\n\nIntelligent\n\nLongtermist\n\nTransparent\n\nCaring\n\nProsocial\n\nConfident\n\nMy dating profile\n\nBounty\n\nVideo interview about my dating profile\n\nGeneral\n\nLooks\n\nRelationship structure and attraction\n\nRelationship\n\nAbout me\n\nLocation\n\nChildren\n\nFinances\n\nPersonality I’m interested in\n\nGenetic code and surrogate parents\n\nNumber\n\nUpbringing"

      "fullText": "Moderately nerdy guy (age 30) who writes stories, translates songs, and overshares cat pictures. Currently living in New York City but leaning against settling down here permanently, and likes the idea of living somewhere family-friendly (that isn’t a suburb).\n\nBy nerdy, I mean that I tend to get into phases where I get weirdly excited about things. To take a few random recent examples: Which countries have the best and most cost-effective transit systems[1], and urbanism and city planning more generally [2]. Computability theory[3], or alternate computation models , like what its implications would look like for a world that had regular time travel. Acrobatics.\n\nThe history of clothes making[4]. Making homemade liquor.\n\nCats[5]. Elaborate improvised constructs.\n\nWhat a world would look like if time travel was possible but constrained by computability limits, except that cats could effectively get around them by having weak preferences, and the whole thing ran on a hybrid Miyazaki/Moomins/FF7 aesthetic. And so on.\n\nBy family-oriented, I mean, well – I like happy families. And I like kids, and really want kids, and like the kind of family/tribal structures where people of different ages actually interact.\n\nI am slightly trad in some ways, by which I mean something like enjoying some traditions and traditional attitudes but not actually being particularly religious. So I like Friday night family dinners (with the candles and the nice tablecloth[6]), and I like casual gender norms (In that, say, I prefer the sound of “my wife” to “my spouse”), but don’t do regular prayers or really keep kosher (except I don’t eat pork).\n\nFor stories – I wrote this one about first contact , or this one about bike lanes . For song translations, I mostly do Israeli folk songs (like this one , or this one ).\n\nMost of all, I want a family. I want a good happy partnership relationship, and I want a bunch of kids. There’s probably practical constraints on how many kids I could practically have or handle, but in principle, I’m a fan of the idea of having lots of kids. I think I would be a good dad.\n\nI currently live in New York and work doing vague finance and programming stuff. I like it here for now, but I wouldn’t want to settle down permanently, or raise kids here. Where I want to end up is a hard question – for having kids, I’d want to be somewhere clean and pedestrian-friendly, where the kids can walk safely by themselves to get around or play outside or whatnot. Sometimes I think about going back to Israel, but there are other places that meet those conditions. (Financially, I do have more than enough to support a family, including if I was married to someone who wanted to be a homemaker or work nonprofit or whatever, or to take a few years off for that matter).\n\nMy ideal relationship involves sharing random ideas that get us excited off each other, cooking or going on hikes together, randomly messaging each other cat pictures, developing a pool of shared references and frames that becomes a little like a shared language, spiderman kisses (that is, where one or both of the people doing the kissing are hanging upside-down), and eventually raising a bunch of kids together.\n\nIf the above part sounds appealing, you should try to contact me! You can email me ( shaked.koplewitz@gmail.com , preferred), find me on facebook, whatever.\n\nI like the idea of social proof – if we know people in common, you can talk to me through them, or talk to them about whether they think we’d work.\n\nProperties common in people I have good relationships with:\n\nFinally, if you do want to contact me but aren’t sure how, ideas for conversation starters\n\n[1] https://transitcosts.com/\n\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaJf01RPphU\n\n[3] https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book\n\n[4] https://acoup.blog/2021/03/05/collections-clothing-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-high-fiber/\n\n[5] In order: Harvey and Olivia (top left), Uriel (napping) and Larry and Rosie (my ex step-pets, which is a delightful palindrome).\n\n[6] https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/bring-back-the-sabbath/\n\n[7] Okay this one was probably a stretch.\n\nsuch a smart move to put the cats at the end!\n\nLike Like\n\nThey are very excellent cats.\n\nHahaha… clever! Good read.\n\nΔ\n\nAbout\n\nGetting delighted by things. Probably the biggest single factor, although it can be hard to describe. If you’re the sort of person who would build the food pyramid I mentioned above, or give names to random wildlife, or stop to look in random windows because you’re curious what the people inside live like, or like to think about the logistics of feeding a continent of sentient hamsters, we are likely to get along and you should give me a call.\n\nCompatible life goals. This one is pretty obvious, I guess.\n\nAbility to resolve conflicts. I’m not always great at immediately noticing when something is bothering someone, but I do listen when people talk to me about things. It helps a lot in a relationship, if you’re someone who can bring up things that bother you, and we can talk it through and solve it.\n\nHaving initiative, and dreams, and like to do things.They don’t have to be shared interests – I just like people who have interests they get excited about.\n\nWhat would the world look like if it had time-travelling cats?\n\nIf you had the choice to be turned into a group of hamsters, how many hamsters would it take for you to prefer being the group of hamsters to being human?\n\nWhat’s something you deeply care about, or something that would make your life or your neighborhood or the world better?\n\nIf you could be in any sort of place imaginable right now, where would you be?\n\nAny random thing you’ve been thinking about lately\n\nJust “Hi” is also good!\n\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window) X\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook\n\nLea says: January 28, 2022 at 4:46 am such a smart move to put the cats at the end!

      "fullText": "By Brian Tomasik\n\nFirst published: 2020 Sep 20 . Last nontrivial update: 2023 Aug 24 .\n\nAs of fall 2023, after having this profile up for nearly three years, I think I probably don't want a relationship after all, though maybe this will change again some day. :)\n\nThe main issue is that relationships take up a fair amount of time, often more than you expect they will. I already feel stressed by the number of tasks I have to do and the finite energy I have for completing them. A relationship adds more items to my todo list, and even though most of the time spent on a relationship is fun, it's an additional firehose of responsibility that I can't just turn off when I'm too busy. Solo hobbies are better in this regard because I can do as much or as little of them as I choose at any given time.\n\nI never want to have children or pets because I don't want the responsibility of being the primary caretaker for another creature. Likewise, I plausibly don't want the responsibility of being the primary caretaker for another adult human. I like helping people from time to time, but being the main source of companionship and emotional support for another person can begin to feel burdensome—unless that other person is extremely introverted and self-sufficient.\n\nI'm keeping this page up as an archive. Feel welcome to still write to me if you want to, such as because you think you might be an excellent match or because you think a long-term relationship could require minimal time in most future scenarios. (I'm not really interested in short-term relationships.)\n\nBelow is the original dating profile.\n\n❄\n\nThis is a dating profile for myself. It's written partly out of academic interest, as an autobiographical portrait of my current life, and partly with the goal of possibly finding a life partner. I have so many preferences about my lifestyle that the number of people for whom I would be a suitable romantic partner is extremely small. Nonetheless, if you happen to find what I wrote appealing, feel free to contact me about this topic. (If you're shy about revealing your identity, you could write to me using a pseudonymous email account.)\n\nText fields on dating websites for describing oneself and one's relationship preferences are almost always too short. This page allows me to expand on what I'm looking for if I pursue a romantic relationship.\n\nI'm open to either an in-person or indefinite long-distance relationship. In theory I would prefer an in-person relationship, but I'm very picky about my lifestyle, so in practice an indefinite long-distance relationship may be more feasible.\n\nWhether the relationship is in-person or long-distance, here are some criteria to help quickly figure out if we might be compatible. I would look for\n\nIn the case of an in-person relationship, these are some additional things I would look for:\n\nIn an indefinite long-distance relationship, it's fine if you already have kids and don't want more (or at least don't want more kids fathered by me). I just wouldn't want the noise and complexity of having kids in my own house.\n\nI'm open to either monogamy or polyamory depending on the circumstances. I would probably prefer monogamy in an ideal world, but in practice, polyamory might be more realistic given that I don't want to spend a lot of time on a relationship.\n\nBecause I'm introverted and have so many uncommon lifestyle preferences, I don't mind if I remain single forever. Sometimes I think I might even prefer staying single.\n\nTo see my answers on other compatibility questions, visit my OkCupid profile .\n\nThere seem to be two main philosophies when it comes to dating. Some people, including me, prefer to enumerate their preferences and dealbreakers from the outset, in order to filter out incompatible people as quickly as possible. Others apparently like to \"keep an air of mystery\" in the process and get to know details about someone over the course of in-person conversations. I can understand this latter approach if you enjoy dating just for its own sake. Maybe it's similar to how I want to be surprised by the ending of a movie rather than having it spoiled. However, if your goal is to actually find a great match, it seems to me that laying out as much detail up front as possible is the better way to go. I would rather be in a nice relationship than be looking for one, so I prefer to find a good match more efficiently.\n\nIn that spirit, this page lays out the main compatibility issues I would have when considering a romantic relationship. I have a lot of dealbreakers. I would rather be single than be in a relationship with 99.9% of potential matches, so filtering on compatibility ahead of time is pretty essential for me.\n\nI live in a house in a rural area of upstate New York, USA. For reasons of convenience and family, I prefer not to move away from where I am now, at least not for another decade or two. However, there aren't many people near me, I don't have a car or driver's license, and I prefer not to make unnecessary car trips because this squishes and splats bugs (and I don't want to cause bugs to suffer). So for the short run, any relationship I have would almost certainly be mostly long-distance. I dislike traveling , but I could probably stand to meet up in person about once a year if the person were far away (including international), or maybe twice a year if the person lived in the northeastern USA. For me, an ideal approach to long-distance communication in the long run might be, say, a 2-hour video or voice call once a week (or maybe a 4-hour call every other week), plus short written messages roughly daily or every other day. (In the first few months of the relationship, we might be excited and want to talk a lot more than this.)\n\nSometimes, if I'm in a productive mood or am otherwise not interested in socializing, I like to avoid checking my messages for several days in a row. If I'm ready to get useful things done, I don't want to waste time on talking, and I worry that even a small amount of talking might break my focus and lead me to want to talk more. This is similar to the reason why I avoid eating even a single bite of food when I'm not hungry: if I eat even a small amount, it may shift my body into eating mode, causing me to become hungry. I imagine that this tendency to not check my messages as often as most people do would be pretty annoying for many partners. There's an OkCupid question: \"Is it a requirement that you communicate every day with your significant other (via phone, text, in person, whatever)?\" I find that many women say it is a requirement, but that would be close to a dealbreaker for me.\n\nIf the relationship lasted a while and the other person was open to moving to my somewhat ugly rural house, I would consider that option as well. However, living together raises numerous additional complications, such as minimizing noise, avoiding interrupting each other too often, and resolving conflicting preferences about the house itself. These complications might be worth it for the benefits of being together in person, including more physical contact and ease/privacy of communication.\n\nI have a number of unusual lifestyle quirks and preferences that may cause incompatibilities. Here are some main ones:\n\nYou can see some biographical information about me on my home page and my résumé .\n\nI worked at Microsoft from 2009 to 2013. I donated some of my earnings to charity but kept a lot as personal savings. At the age of 26, I \"retired\" from formal employment and instead devoted more time to blogging on my site Essays on Reducing Suffering . I'm also an advisor to some nonprofit organizations, as well as to individuals who ask me questions. I'm a well known member of the \"effective altruism\" movement. I do all of these activities unpaid, so technically I'm unemployed.\n\nI'm extremely introverted and can go for days without needing to talk with other people. I prefer to work on whatever I'm interested in at the moment for long stretches of uninterrupted time. Typically I do \"social\" activities like checking email and Facebook once or twice a day, usually when eating meals at my computer. I almost never leave my house, not even to go outdoors, because I don't want to crush bugs by walking outside, and there may be ticks in the grass. Plus, almost everything I want to do is indoors. (I take vitamin D supplements due to not getting much sunshine.) I spend most of my waking hours at my computer; the rest is spent lifting dumbbells, preparing food, showering, cleaning things around the house, and so on. I work at my computer standing up on a treadmill, and for 1-3 hours per day I walk slowly on the treadmill while using my computer.\n\nI prefer to organize items in my room the way I want them organized, and I wouldn't want other people to live in my room. Even if I shared the house with a romantic partner, I would sleep in a separate bed in a separate room to avoid being woken up by the other person and to avoid waking the other person. Plus, given my erratic waking hours, I often would not be sleeping at the same time as the other person anyway.\n\nIf I were to have a romantic relationship, I would prefer for my lifestyle to remain roughly the same as it is now. That's pretty feasible in the case of a long-distance relationship because it doesn't involve living with another person. For an in-person relationship, I would hope that our living situation could be pretty similar to the way that two strangers would share a house, in terms of sleeping apart, having separate rooms, and minimizing interruptions of each other. Of course, we wouldn't be just like strangers because we would also meet up to talk regularly, maybe do some chores together, and share physical intimacy.\n\nIt's probably not feasible for now, but in the long run I could imagine even living in little separate houses next door to one another rather than in the same house, in order to reduce disturbing one another and make a clear separation between our respective spaces. This arrangement would minimize the disagreements and annoyances that living together could cause while allowing for closer contact than is possible with a long-distance relationship. Ideally these two mini houses could be connected by an indoor hallway so that we wouldn't have to go outdoors in order to visit each other.\n\nI would prefer a relationship in which we work on our own separate projects almost all the time and don't judge each other for how we spend our time. I would enjoy talking about what we're doing but without any expectations for the other person. For this reason, I don't have strong preferences about whether the other person would have a job or not, would be \"ambitious\" or not, etc.\n\nI would prefer for my partner to be reasonably independent and not need my help too often, though I would be happy to occasionally assist with physical tasks, questions, emotional troubles, and so on. Likewise, I also would be pretty independent.\n\nMy costs of living are fairly low. Most of my expenses are on essentials like food and health insurance. If my partner wanted financial support from me, I would prefer if she were also fairly frugal, although spending on the order of $1000 to $2000 per year on \"luxuries\" would be ok. If my partner earned her own income and spent that money on a more lavish lifestyle, that may also be ok, although I'm more likely to get along with people who have an altruistic mindset and want to donate significant portions of their income to charity.\n\nMy main altruistic focus in life is seeking to reduce suffering, especially the suffering of non-human animals and possible digital creatures that may be created in the future. In philosophical jargon, I'm roughly a negative utilitarian , which means I think suffering is vastly more morally significant than happiness or other valuable things. Unbearable torture cannot be \"morally offset\" by also bringing enough pleasure into the world. This stance leads to a kind of antinatalism , because often the easiest way to prevent unbearable suffering is for a being never to be born in the first place. For example, there's an extraordinary amount of animal (especially invertebrate) suffering occurring in nature, due to predation, disease, starvation, and so on. One way to reduce this suffering is to reduce the amount of nature that exists. For instance, we could cover lawns with gravel to prevent grass growth, and with less grass to eat, there would be fewer animals. (In the long run, I would like to have a gravel, no-grass lawn at my house. It should also reduce the risk of ticks.)\n\nPolitically my values lean toward progressive, but I think there are many real-world complexities that make any dogmatic stances unwise. For example, increasing the minimum wage seems noble but could also increase unemployment and force some companies out of business (though it may still be a good policy on balance). Also, my negative-utilitarian philosophy is sometimes at odds with progressive policies, such as when I favor reducing rather than increasing the amount of wilderness that exists. On issues like feminism, I'm somewhere in between the vociferous voices on either side of the debates. Despite agreeing with social-justice advocates on many policy stances, I can be turned off by the more aggressive forms of social-justice activism because I prefer more respectful and nuanced discussion of these difficult issues.\n\nI'm an atheist, although I find it reasonably likely that we (or at least some copies of us) live in a computer simulation of some kind.\n\nIn terms of interpersonal relationships, I think trust is fundamental. Knowing that the other person won't do something harmful behind your back is very important. A relationship should be a place where you feel completely comfortable in the other person's presence and can tell him/her anything, as long as it's done in a respectful way. For example, if one person were inclined to cheat on his/her partner, I would favor discussing these feelings openly and seeing what could be done about the situation. If one person feels dissatisfied about some aspect of the relationship, it's generally better to discuss the problem and work toward solutions rather than letting the negative feelings fester. (That said, if unhappy feelings are trivial or transitory, sometimes it makes sense to keep them to yourself and let them fade on their own rather than troubling the other person about them.)\n\nI intend to remain childfree indefinitely, because raising kids takes an enormous amount of time that I would rather spend on my current activities. I have a vasectomy, which combined with possibly other forms of birth control such as condoms and the rhythm method would preclude pregnancies. I would also want to avoid adopting kids. I dislike pets for a similar reason: they take time and resources, they can get into trouble around the house, and I don't get much enjoyment from being around them. Plus, I don't want to buy pet food containing animal products, which gives some revenue to the factory-farming industry. My childfree requirement is an absolute dealbreaker, while my anti-pet stance is merely a strong preference. If there were an otherwise amazing match who really wanted a cat or dog, I could probably learn to live with that.\n\nI'm a lacto-vegetarian, meaning I'm vegan except that I eat dairy products (mostly cheese and ice cream). I'd be happy with a partner who was vegan or lacto-vegetarian. I also don't mind someone who eats beef on a regular basis because the harm caused to farmed animals per calorie of food is much smaller than for other forms of meat and because in some cases I think cattle farming may reduce wild-animal suffering. I would probably feel dismayed to see a partner eat any smaller animals than cows on a regular basis. (Maybe lamb would be ok too.) Eating a serving of fish or other non-cow animals once or twice per year as a health precaution would probably be ok, and eating meat leftovers from a social event that would otherwise go to waste is of course fine.\n\nI would also prefer if my partner didn't consume much honey or rice , for animal-suffering reasons, although this is less important than not eating chicken/fish/eggs, and if I can be convinced that rice harvesting is no more violent than, e.g., wheat harvesting, I'd be fine with it.\n\nI prefer to avoid non-trivially illegal activities, including illegal drugs. I also wouldn't want secondhand smoke in the house. My main concerns with drugs like alcohol would be whether they impair one's judgment or cause one's personality to become more annoying. Personally I don't do any drugs (besides medical/nutritional ones) and never consume alcohol. I even avoid caffeine, but I wouldn't care if a partner consumed it.\n\nI'm looking for a long-term relationship, one in which I could be best friends with my partner for an indefinite period of time. Such a relationship could potentially last for life, but I also recognize that statistically, even many marriages don't last, and maybe this is a good thing, because people can change a lot over time.\n\nIf we lived together, I would imagine splitting housework in the same way that strangers sharing a house would: we would generally each take care of our own side of it. We could each clean our own rooms, prepare our own meals, do our own laundry, etc. If one person wanted to do some of these things for the other person, that would be fine (although I personally would still want to clean my own rooms and prepare most of my own food). Some activities like grocery shopping and taking trash to the transfer station would make more sense for a single person to do for both of us (or we could hire a third party to do these tasks).\n\nI would favor dividing the house between us as much as possible and letting each person do whatever s/he wants with his/her half of the house (except in the case of externalities like noise, secondhand smoke, jeopardizing the security of our home computer network, etc). Our possessions would likewise be mostly our own rather than shared. Dividing things up in this way would reduce the frequency of disagreements about how something should be done, because there would be fewer things to disagree about. Some rooms (like the kitchen) and possessions (like the washing machine) would have to be shared, and in that case, we would decide together what changes to make to them.\n\nI think entertainment/music/etc tastes are pretty irrelevant for romantic compatibility. For whatever it's worth, the movies/shows/channels on Netflix and YouTube that I watch are mostly comedies, because I usually want to relax rather than to process something emotionally heavy, though I enjoy other genres too on occasion. Even if I lived with someone else, I would prefer to watch TV on my own while exercising, because I only want to watch something when I'm specifically in the mood for it rather than at a scheduled time, and I often take breaks. For example, if I'm lifting dumbbells, I may need to take a bathroom break to wash my hands if they've become greasy, which worsens my grip. I would prefer for a partner to always use earbuds/headphones while watching TV or listening to music to avoid creating noise, and I do the same.\n\nI think I generally look ok, but there are some parts of my appearance that may not be very pleasant:\n\nI shave all the hair on my body fairly short, to roughly half a centimeter in length. Having less hair just feels less messy, and it makes checking my body for ticks easier. I fully shave my facial hair about once a week and let it grown in between those shavings.\n\nFollowing are some fairly typical photos of me, taken in summer 2020.\n\nIn the last of these photos you can most clearly see some dermatitis buildup on my face.\n\nFor better or worse, the physical features that I find attractive in women are roughly society's conventional beauty standards, perhaps because that's what I grew up seeing on TV and in magazines in my childhood during the 1990s. I think attractiveness affects male motivation for a relationship at a deep \"lizard brain\" level, so it does matter to some degree, but I also prefer if a partner doesn't feel pressure to change her appearance on account of me, because that can be unpleasant.\n\nThe main reason attractiveness matters is not for sex; I don't care that much about sex per se. The more significant reason is that attractiveness plays some role in the amount of \"warm fuzzies\" that I feel and how much I enjoy talking with the person, and for me, those are the main reasons to have a romantic relationship. I have relatively little relationship experience, so maybe this view of mine is naive or would change with time.\n\nIn general, my (possibly naive) ranked list of motivations for a relationship in descending order of importance is\n\nThe last of these two mainly only apply to an in-person relationship rather than a long-distance one, but they're less important to me than the first two.\n\nUpdate from 2022: I hope readers don't conclude from the above discussion that they have to be reasonably attractive in order to contact me. I care less about attractiveness than the average man, even if I may be more honest about its role than most men are. Since originally writing the above section in 2020, I've found that the amount I care about attractiveness has decreased even further over time. Traits like warmth, emotional stability, intelligence, caring about animal welfare and reducing suffering, and being able to get tasks done in a dependable way on one's own are all probably at least as important to me as physical attractiveness—except if a potential partner is unusually unattractive. Roughly, I think as long as a potential partner is above the ~25th percentile of attractiveness for her age, then I could probably learn to live with that, especially if she would be open to sometimes using porn together during sexual activity for extra eye candy, which I expect could go a long way toward reducing how much I care about her own appearance.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was often told that \"beauty is only skin deep\" and \"what really matters is on the inside\" when choosing a romantic partner. I generally assumed that was the case, but over time I began hearing more people express a contrary opinion that no, actually, physical attractiveness plays a big role in relationship satisfaction. I assumed that maybe those people were right and that maybe the messages about how beauty doesn't matter too much were sort of benign propaganda. However, as I've continued dating and introspecting on what matters to me, I'm beginning to think that maybe the people who said appearances aren't that important were mostly right? I still don't have a lot of experience, so maybe I'll change my mind yet again. If porn and masturbation didn't exist or were prohibited by my religion, then I could imagine that the attractiveness of my partner might be fairly important, because I would only be able to have sexual experiences with that one person. But given that porn and masturbation do exist, maybe those already provide a reasonable substitute for an attractive partner, especially if those experiences can be shared with my partner.\n\nIn my opinion, looking extremely attractive is like training for the Olympics. It's cool that some people work hard at it so that the rest of us can appreciate the fruits of their labor. But most people don't need to be training for the Olympics nor going to great lengths to be beautiful. Of course, even if we don't need to be Olympic athletes, a little bit of exercise is still good, and likewise, very low-effort ways to improve one's appearance are also welcome.\n\nI'm introverted but also enjoy talking with people when I'm in the mood. If I get along well with someone, I like having long, deep, and intimate discussions. Some of my conversations with friends have gone for 6 or 7 hours. I'm fairly empathetic and usually care about others' emotions. I sometimes try to be funny and tell \"dad jokes\" (though I never want to be an actual dad). I also enjoy self-deprecating humor, though I'm not always joking when I describe my shortcomings. :)\n\nI'm usually in a pretty good mood and have a positive attitude, despite my \"pessimistic\" negative-utilitarian and antinatalist philosophies. The reason I hold a suffering-focused ethical view is not because I'm unhappy; I think life is sorta fun much of the time. Rather, my reason is that some experiences of intense suffering are so awful and morally salient that everything else seems trivial by comparison.\n\nI'm attracted to women who are warm, supportive, considerate, funny, and (once we know each other enough) flirty. I try to have all those attributes as well, though I may not necessarily succeed.\n\nI try to be non-judgmental, though I may disagree with another person's views on something. In cases of conflict, I prefer discussing the problem, seeking to resolve it, and trying to avoid holding grudges. I like this quote: \"Holding a grudge is like holding a hot iron—it hurts you.\"\n\nI think I get angry less often than average, and when I do have that emotion, I usually express my feelings using words rather than shouting or making insults. I would hope for the same from a partner. I would not be able to live with someone who had a hot temper too often.\n\nAs problems arise in a relationship, I prefer to hear about them and brainstorm solutions together. Some polite disagreements and concerns from time to time in a generally happy relationship are normal and manageable. However, if non-trivial issues keep arising on a regular basis, I may prefer to give up rather than continue trying to fix them, given that I like being single and don't need a relationship. If a relationship is causing significant distress more often than, say, once every few months in the long run, it seems like more trouble than it's worth. Therefore, I wouldn't be able to provide the level of certainty or commitment that some people might want in a relationship. That said, if the relationship seemed otherwise extremely promising, I'd likely continue trying for a few months or maybe even 1-2 years before throwing in the towel.\n\nI enjoy exchanging sweet sentiments with a romantic partner, but I'm not interested in the formal romantic holidays like our anniversary, Valentine's Day, birthdays, etc. In general, I don't celebrate holidays. I prefer to do nice things together when the mood arises rather than on a schedule. I also am not very excited by gifts unless the person actually needs the item that would be purchased, and even in that case, instead of receiving a gift I would rather buy the item myself to make sure I'm getting exactly the kind I want. I could pick out the exact item I want on Amazon and send its URL to the other person, but that seems like unnecessary overhead relative to just buying it myself. Instead of gifts, I prefer to show affection by occasionally writing nice messages, making videos, helping with chores, providing reassurance, and so on.\n\nI dislike surprises (surprise parties, surprise gifts, etc) because I want to plan ahead for things and discuss together whether a proposal makes sense. In general, I prefer life to be calm and predictable rather than \"exciting\". Excitement can come from entertainment rather than real life.\n\nI find that romantic interaction, such as talking with a girlfriend, feels like eating sugar: it's sweet, pleasant, and somewhat addictive. There are times when I really want sugar, and times when I feel full of it. The same is true for interaction with a girlfriend. I use the word \"sugar-hungry\" to describe those times when I crave romantic interaction and the word \"sugar-full\" to describe times when I'm satiated and don't want more romantic interaction. (I used to name these emotional states based on a specific kind of sugary food, like cake, but I don't want to subconsciously encourage people to eat non-vegan cake because the eggs it contains caused enormous suffering to factory-farmed hens.)\n\nWhat happens if my and my girlfriend's sugar levels are different at a given time? If one person is hungry to spend time together while the other would rather get work done, what do you do? In my opinion, work is much more important than romantic interaction, since romance is just a fun bonus in life, while altruistic efforts are what really matter. So I think the default should be that if one person wants romantic interaction while the other doesn't, no interaction takes place. Both people should \"swipe right\" (in Tinder lingo) on a given interaction at a given time before it occurs. An exception would be if one person is feeling significantly bad and needs to talk about something right away.\n\nAn unfortunate aspect of my personality for relationship compatibility is that I tend to get very interested in something for a while and then lose that interest for a while, until getting interested again. In the case of romantic sugar, I sometimes want to binge on it for a while and then fast for several days afterward. This could be pretty annoying to someone who prefers more moderate serving sizes every day. That said, it's plausible that if the other person prevented my sugar binges, then my periods of fasting would also be shorter.\n\nThe addictiveness of romance can also be a problem if it's tempting and distracts from focus on other things. For this reason, I think I would prefer long periods of talking on an infrequent basis (like once a week), so that during the rest of the time I could get absorbed in my work and non-romance forms of leisure, rather than being distracted by thinking about the next romantic interaction or checking the other person's availability. Unfortunately, because of my erratic waking hours, I wouldn't be able to schedule a fixed time slot for interaction each week. Also, I might randomly be sugar-full or otherwise absorbed into something else when the scheduled interaction would have occurred, which would be unpleasant. Interrupting the flow of meaningful work just to enjoy some fun sugar instead is something I would want to avoid as much as possible.\n\nSo there are some challenges here, and maybe I find these things more difficult than most people do. But I imagine that enough brainstorming, experimentation, and patience could produce a system for managing different sugar levels that works well enough, as long as the other person also roughly shares my introversion and belief that work is more important than romance.\n\nAlso, it's plausible that this problem would lessen in the long run once my girlfriend and I got more used to each other, because the tastiness of our sugar might decline. There are several things (foods, TV shows, intellectual topics, etc) that I used to find terribly addictive but now don't because I just got more accustomed to them.\n\nWhen I first wrote this dating profile in 2020, one of my criteria for a relationship said: \"monogamous but allowing for viewing/reading porn\". In the following two years, half a dozen people asked me about the reasoning behind my preference for monogamy, with some people suggesting that polyamory could work better given that I don't want to spend a lot of time with my partner. In 2022, I finally updated this profile to say that I would consider either monogamy or polyamory depending on the situation. This section elaborates on my thinking. That said, I know little about the theory of polyamory or what it looks like in practice, so some of what I say may be mistaken.\n\nHere are my reasons for preferring to have only one partner for myself:\n\nAnd here are my reasons for wanting my partner to be monogamous:\n\nSince these are currently my main hesitations about polyamory, in cases where they wouldn't apply, I would be open to trying polyamory.\n\nI would consider two partners for myself in a situation where the time spent with each person wouldn't exceed 1-2 hours per week on average, where I wasn't deeply in love with any person enough to not want another partner, and where neither partner would be made jealous.\n\nIf I lived with a partner in person, I plausibly wouldn't have time for any other partner because living together requires a decent amount of in-person interaction, and plausibly my introvert brain would already feel enough social stimulation from that to not want more. Also, because of STI concerns, I plausibly wouldn't want to do IRL sexual activity with anyone except a primary partner who herself was monogamous. However, online sexual interaction with other people wouldn't be ruled out.\n\n(Another argument against IRL sex in a long-distance relationship is that traveling would squish bugs and harm animals in other ways, and I'd feel guilty about causing that harm without a good reason.)\n\nA main possible advantage of polyamory would be that I might be less bothered by the incompatibilities of any given partner. If I have to choose just one partner, there's a lot of pressure to make the perfect choice, but no partner is ever perfect.\n\nOne situation where people often use polyamory is if a main partner has low sex drive. This main partner (often a woman) might encourage her boyfriend/husband to get sex elsewhere. I'm unsure if I would be happy with an arrangement of that sort, because for me, a main point of sexual interaction is to feel intimate with someone I love and to increase romantic attraction. If I just wanted an orgasm, I could masturbate on my own. In evolutionary terms, it doesn't make sense for a man to have romantic feelings toward a woman whom he never has sex with, because she won't bear his children, so at best she would be one more friend. I suppose there are some exceptions to this evolutionary claim, such as if a woman could help the man raise kids from a previous relationship. Also, the predictions of armchair evolutionary psychology aren't necessarily true in the real world, though I think it is true that many men require an expectation of eventually having some amount of sexual activity in order to feel significant romantic interest in someone. In any case, there are many couples where having sex outside the relationship makes things work for them, which is great.\n\nI would be open to a polyamourous partner if STIs weren't a concern, if I wasn't so in love with her that I worried about losing her, and if all of her other partners were genuinely ok with her being polyamourous rather than just grudgingly accepting of it.\n\nSTIs would not be a concern either if I was never physically intimate IRL with her, or if she wasn't physically intimate with anyone besides me IRL. In theory if there was a third person who was also STI-paranoid, it might work for her to have two IRL partners, but I would worry about making things complicated, and we would have to deeply trust the honesty of everyone involved. In any case, I don't live near enough like-minded people for it to be likely that there would even be multiple IRL partners.\n\nThe possibility of jealousy felt by her other partners is a main hesitation of mine, since I would feel guilty unless everyone involved was enthusiastically consenting to the arrangement. That said, I imagine there are some people who are enthusiastic enough about polyamory to allay this worry.\n\nThe main benefit of having a polyamorous partner would be that I wouldn't be the only person responsible for her romantic needs, and I could spend less time on the relationship than most monogamous women would prefer.\n\nParts of this page were inspired by discussions about compatibility with a girlfriend during summer 2020.

One day I might be awake during daylight hours, and a few days later, I might be awake during the night. One reason for this is that my sleep sometimes gets disrupted, meaning that I sleep too little and then need to nap the next day, leading to further sleep disturbance. The other reason is that even when my sleep pattern is pretty regular from one day to the next, my waking hours may tend to creep forward by roughly an hour per day, which is made possible because I don't use an alarm clock. My sleep schedule is able to move around like this because I don't have any set working hours and keep pre-scheduled phone calls to a minimum. As a result of this irregularity, the times when I would be available to talk with a romantic partner would be variable and unpredictable.\n\nI can be a bit irrationally cautious about some things. For example, I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I don't like sharing towels, silverware, dishes, etc. I dislike \"double dipping\" with food. I'm nervous about getting Lyme disease from ticks that are prevalent around my house, and I spend a fair amount of time checking my body for ticks. If someone else goes outside around my house, I prefer to avoid touching them until after a thorough tick check in case they have ticks crawling on them.\n\nConsistent with my germaphobia, I'm very cautious regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs). I'm even slightly grossed out by lip kissing and would prefer kissing places that aren't bodily openings. Before having sex I would first want to do a complete array of STI tests, including for things like genital herpes that aren't always tested by default. Because of the \"window period\" for HIV testing, I would prefer for an HIV test to occur as much as half a year after the last possible HIV exposure (such as from sex with a previous partner), and I would prefer to avoid sex (even with condoms) until the test came back negative. While I think having sex before marriage is a good idea to verify sexual compatibility, I prefer not to rush into it either. Given that most people are vastly less cautious about STIs than this, I'm probably fairly irrational here, but oh well.\n\nI'm troubled by the suffering of bugs around the house, and I try to euthanize injured or dying bugs, typically by putting them into a container in the freezer. While I wouldn't expect a romantic partner to actively care for bugs in this way, I would be emotionally upset by deliberate swatting, crushing, drowning, etc of bugs. In addition, I prefer to seal food scraps in a plastic container before throwing them in the trash to prevent fruit flies from breeding. I oppose composting food waste because it gives rise to thousands of bugs whose short lives inevitably end in painful deaths.\n\nIn many parts of the world, particularly towns and cities, the residential water supply is drawn from rivers, lakes, or reservoirs that contain numerous invertebrate animals, like copepods and rotifers. These animals die painfully as that water is withdrawn for treatment. At my current house, water is drawn instead from a deep well, which likely contains vastly less biological activity than surface waters do. If I were to move from my current house to a city, I would feel guilty about showering and washing my hands because of the numerous invertebrates it would kill.\n\nI have a lot of acne on my upper chest and back.\n\nWhen I don't shower often enough, I develop flaky skin on my face and scalp due to seborrhoeic dermatitis. After I wash my face with Head & Shoulders shampoo, the areas where skin was peeled off can appear red.\n\nI'm somewhat overweight, with most of the excess fat concentrated in my belly. I'm 69.5 inches tall with a weight around 183 pounds, making my BMI in the range 26 to 27.\n\nThe feeling of warm fuzzies when spending time together (talking, doing chores together, etc). These fuzzies are also somewhat present when we're apart and doing our own stuff.\n\nCompanionship, friendship, emotional support, mental intimacy.\n\nPhysical intimacy (hugging, cuddling, sexual activity).\n\nHelping each other out with chores/etc.\n\nTime : I'm extremely introverted and don't want to spend much time with a partner. One partner is already a big time commitment for me. Having two partners who both expected a nontrivial amount of interaction would be a nightmare.\n\nLove : When I'm in love with someone, the thought of another partner is unappealing. It seems like eating another meal when I'm already full from the first meal.\n\nJealousy : If my partner wanted me to be monogamous, I wouldn't want to make her jealous or hurt by having another partner.\n\nSTIs : If she was physically intimate with other people (IRL, not just online), then I would worry about STI spreading, and guarding against that would be a big hassle. Of course, if I myself wasn't physically intimate with her IRL, this wouldn't matter.\n\nLove : If I were in love with my partner, I would worry about losing her. If she were romantic with other people, maybe she would become more attached to them over time and want to leave me.\n\nJealousy : I would worry that some of her other partners might not be ok with her being polyamorous. Maybe the time she spent with me would make them unhappy, even if they claimed to be fine with it.\n\nMy dating profile\n\nContents\n\nMonogamy vs polyamory"
