      "fullText": "﻿DATE YOU\r\nHey, I'm Ilyaas.\r\nI am 20 years old, 5'9\" or 174 cm looking for a monogamous relationship. I am currently living in Cincinnati, Ohio, but plan on moving to SF/NYC soon.\r\nThis webpage was last updated on: 20 Nov 2025\r\nWho I am:\r\n  \r\n\r\nDating app bio:\r\nTinkerer who writes code, carves wood, bends metal (and reality)\r\nAthlete that throws weights, numbers and you around ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nSecure attachment style\r\nPrimary love languages: Physical Touch, Quality Time, Words of Affirmation.\r\nI can give most love languages liberally. Acts of Service and Gift giving does not come naturally, and will take time to experiment and learn.\r\nFeedback from my last long term relationship:\r\n* Can be rude when stressed or when focused and interrupted (working on this)\r\n* Can hurt without intending to \r\nI want to have kids at some point. Most likely when I am wealthy enough for consumer things to be virtually free and when I can homeschool them myself or pay for schools that make sense, e.g. Alpha School. I will be damned if I am going to teach my kid to ask permission to pee.\r\nI do not believe in god. I was muslim and am now atheist. I get the belief but if your beliefs limit your agency, I am unlikely to make you happy. I will happily tell our children why they should not believe though.\r\nI am a man of routine. I want to be in one place while I build wealth. After that may be a nomadic lifestyle due to my love for mountain biking.\r\nWhy you should not date me:\r\n* I eat clean food (mostly chicken/rice/veggies), rarely eating out (unless on a trip). If you cook me a mean steak, I will not refuse though.\r\n* I train at the gym 5x a week.\r\n* If you do not want to get on creatine and other longevity routines, because I want to live for a long time. If we get together, I would like to have you live with me as long as possible.\r\n* When we fight you will get no space, at least physically, but most likely mentally too. I am much more likely to hold you while you gather yourself than let you walk off. \r\n* Largely traditional values, I think. I am new to the American value system so I may be wrong here.\r\nI am looking for a partner, and the mother of my children. In this, I do not expect you to be a housewife or homemaker because that job can be replaced for 40k USD/year. A mother on the other hand, I can say due to my mother, whose upbringing has contributed to outlier outcomes.\r\nI am looking for someone that believes in me even more than I do, and will be loyal. Someone that wants me to be more of me.\r\nI am currently centering my life on getting smart so I can work on difficult and useful problems and create wealth on the way. The goal for me to have come to the US is to live post-scarcity. Before this, I spent some time in New Zealand because I wanted to be a professional mountain biker. There I discovered that I hate poverty more than I love mountain biking.\r\nI live in ways that make sense to me. For example:\r\n* I sleep on the floor\r\n* I am happy to do dinner dates but will carry my lunchbox with me.\r\n* I recently learned it is polite in the US to wait for your friend to start eating. Why would I do that? Why would I want my friend to be hungrier for longer? Makes 0 sense.\r\nI do have an asian toughness or rashness I would say, and I like that untamed part of me. I have been described as, “the youngest old man I know”, “raw and real”, “annoying, real and loving”, all by different people.\r\nI will most likely go all in soon to try to break things once I am aligned, so in case things don't work out we save the most time and in case we do, I can love you for longer.\r\nCurrently I am solving a problem that involves hardware and prototyping a solution. The market seems to be relatively small but high income. Solutions seem to be DIYed but no official solutions exist yet.\r\nI would love a TVD kind of love but have learned enough to not expect that. What I am looking for now can be accurately summed up in a cofounder for my life and family, possibly business. It could be summed up as the Hormozis, or Courtney and Cbum. As long as I am better with you, I want to be with you, because I want to be better. This could be on the homefront, on the business front, or you could be an artist and have that dynamic. I am open to most things.\r\nI may want to go back to NZ when raising children but that is quite far away.\r\nLife is short, and we will all die. Text me and I’ll take you swing dancing after we walk and talk.\r\nEmail: ilyaasatwork@gmail.com\r\nSignal (preferred): https://signal.me/#eu/8rAMyrw0tr8VHJ_8HmYPrUh09N7NYxlfSBkue8poD9a-b62q3VxLNoOvYpE6Zpyd\r\n\r\nMore pictures below:\r\n________________\r\n        Top left: a photo describing my way of life\r\nTop right: always hungry (for you)\r\nBottom left: deep in thought (maximising shareholder value)\r\nBottom right: mountain biking, my natural habitat"

      "fullText": "﻿Julian Michael  \r\n32, male, straight, monogamous, looking for a life partner.\r\n* I live in San Francisco and hope to settle down in the Bay Area long term.\r\n* I want kids (more than one) and I’m seeking someone who wants the same.\r\nAbout me\r\n* Boyish with a feminine side\r\n* Emotionally open and like talking about feelings\r\n* Intellectual and like talking about ideas\r\n* Serious but don’t take myself seriously\r\n* Somewhat extroverted\r\n* Frequently mistaken for people’s husband (...could be us)\r\nAbout you\r\n(negotiable)\r\n* High openness\r\n* Emotionally fluid\r\n* Silly and tolerant of silliness\r\n* Intellectually inclined and passionate about stuff you are excited to share\r\n* Likes spending time outside and/or engaging in physical combat\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a relationship\r\n* Emotional presence, attunement, and acceptance\r\n* Highly explicit communication and mutual accountability\r\n* Challenging each other (from a place of fun and mutual safety)\r\n* Emotional responsibility: we are solely responsible for our own reactions and emotions\r\n* A relationship and eventually a family environment that’s both intellectually and physically playful\r\n* Secure attachment (I like The Mastery of Love, by Don Miguel Ruiz, as a picture of secure love)\r\nStuff I like doing and would be excited to share\r\n(not required activities, but you’ll at least have to put up with these things)\r\n* Reading and learning about (and occasionally practicing off-label) psychology, psychotherapy, meditation and spirituality\r\n* Learning about human physiology, health, and fitness (unfortunately I find the learning a lot more fun than the implementing)\r\n* Cooking, fermentation of all kinds of things\r\n* Movement play, acrobatics, parkour, roughhousing, dancing\r\n* Thinking about language, AI alignment, ethics, epistemology, and how all of these things fit together\r\n* Deliberating the practical ethics of everyday life and relationships\r\nTestimonials\r\nAsya B. (full testimonial): For someone who really loves Julian, I think what will stand out is that he's very beautiful, very silly, and very high EQ (and really likes talking explicitly about his and others' feelings). I genuinely think he's a romantic catch (single mostly because he's picky and just moved to the Bay), so you may want to act fast!\r\n\r\n\r\nKamile L.: My two favorite qualities in Julian as a friend are the same two qualities that will make him an excellent life partner. The first is that he’s uncommonly excited to and uniquely skilled at connecting emotionally with people. Talking to him makes you feel seen and connected, and this skill and character trait of his makes him incredibly capable of helping you resolve problems of the heart. He is my go-to person to advise on challenging emotional questions, and I am somewhat jealous of whoever ends up being his life partner because they will be the first in line to feel loved, seen, and supported. Although I’ve never had serious conflict with Julian directly, I can also see that this openness will make communication easy and misunderstandings rare. Second, Julian is just a ton of fun to be around. Spending time with him is effortless and silly, laughter when around him is plentiful. From my own marriage, I know that this type of joy is a foundation for an excellent life together. These two character traits combined make him a great friend, but I’m so convinced that this will make for an even better life partner.\r\n<more pending>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested? Introduce yourself to me at julianjohnmichael@gmail.com or get a mutual friend to connect us!"

Get a good night’s sleep to repeat the day again.\nQuirks\nI have several, but none strike me as particularly odd and none that\nwould pick me out from a crowd as especially weird. I dress very\nplainly. I act generally quite quiet and speak softly unless it’s on a\ntopic of interest. I live pretty minimalistically (ironic that the word\nfor it is that long!).\nReviews\nI don’t know what you (reader/future-partner) are looking for in\nlife-partners. I also cannot comment on what living with myself or just\nbeing around me is like without sounding biased, so I asked those who\nknow me best and put their answers in the below table. They are all\nhappy to give more details on request. I had no influence in what they\nsaid other than setting 3 rough categories and a character limit - I\nforbade myself from editing. They all submitted these independently of\neach other (to my knowledge) and they all came at it from their own\nunique relationships/histories with me. All information is accurate (in\ntheir opinion) at the time of their review (c. October 2025). All I\nconsider to be at least good friends who I have immense trust in\n(although one slightly less now I’ve seen their review! 😆), but they\nprobably like me too much and are therefore too positive.\nReviews Table\nTable of Reviews\nSex\nYears Known\nConnection\nYears Lived With\nPositive\nNegative\nQuirk\nFemale\n11\nUniversity friend/flatmate (Former unrequited love of mine)\n3\nLearning lots and always having company - you read a lot and know a lot about random things, so conversation was very interesting. I definitely learnt more about darts! It’s hard to be lonely living with you, because you’re always down for a chat and are mostly very cheery (and if not, there is a good reason why). Similarly, you’re always down to go and do random things like visiting all the places on the Oxford Cluedo board. And you’d offer to cook if I’d had a long day which was lovely.\nOccasionally too much maths chat (taking it beyond what I could understand so it got a bit boring). And sometimes you asked general questions about intimate topics, which I often didn’t mind, but sometimes found awkward.\nOccasional piano music wafting around - you’re an excellent and humble pianist. And you emitted other noises such as strong reactions to darts/football which were sweet. Oh, and you didn’t require much storage space, since you cycled through a relatively limited wardrobe and were otherwise fairly minimalist!\nFemale\n11\nUniversity friend/colleague/flatmate\n1\nPositive of living with you - organised, tidy, routines, easy to coexist alongside\nPositive of spending time with you - knowledgeable about a wide range of interesting topics, can provide a different way of looking at things\nNegative of living with you - limited cooking / meal options, somewhat white / beige decorating (this may not be up to date)\nNegative of spending time with you - collective indecisiveness (this goes both ways 😂)\nQuirk / Unusual - relcutance to share your birthday (I don’t particularly celebrate but will share when needed), you sit in the slightly odd space of being stuck on your habits but also willingly to try new things, maintained passions for your whole life, always looking to learn new things (youtube dives), maintained an up to date interest in Maths - hard to know what to put here.\nMale\n7\nColleague (housemate during Covid lockdowns)\n0.75\nReview\nIncoming\nWatch this space\nFemale + Male\n7 + 6\nColleagues (both former-lodgers, married to each other)\n0.25 + 0.25\nMakes you feel welcome\nRespects space + boundaries\nHappy to match vibes on levels of social interaction\nPragmatic to a fault:\nwill keep house + lifestyle in exactly the optimal state for comfortable living\nOnce wrote to the producers of custard cream spread to express discontent at discontinuation (rephrased as “shows character trait of unusually strongly held opinions about certain specific things”, which might be more useful than the anecdote)\nMale + Female\n4 + 3\nColleague + Colleague's partner (both former-lodgers)\n1.5 + 1\nExceptionally laid-back and at-ease with what happens\nPolite and easy-going (sometimes to a fault)\nStop being so damn considerate all the time (sometimes borders on frustrating)\nFinds it hard to accept gifts/offers of things (run several miles rather than accept a lift)\nSo many instances of quirks (‘Andrew-ism’), not sure where to start:\nDistaste for strong flavours and homedecorating\nMake a sandwich by bringing the whole bag, making it as you go\nLikes white bread a lot, more than the average person\nMale\n2\nColleague (former-lodger)\n1\nMaths chat and interesting random chats are a positive. Got a very comfortable carpet and the sofa too. Parking’s good, and has Sky Sports Golf!\nChairs aren’t comfortable, and you need a special technique for opening the door. One time a parcel was delivered for the neighbour and you didn’t realise the whole weekend - unawareness, at times you’re in your own world (but being able to focus deeply is a good thing)\nDefinitely diet: there’s a lot of sugar and not much else.\nFemale\n0.5\nFormer Dating Interest\n0.01\nHonest when it comes to dating. He really is trying to give you the best sense of what he’s like so both you and he can make a good call\nStrongly defined. He’s clear about what he knows he likes and can tell you all about it and why, with fun puzzles to solve along the way. That said\nOpen to talking about anything I’m interested in. I’ve brought up and sent all sorts of entirely unrelated things his way (some of our interests/thoughts align, many differ) and he always has interesting things to ask/say/contribute and seems to have fun doing so\nSeems generally content, which is really nice to be around. Long walks in company are fun.\nThoughtfully proactive: He’ll plan stuff, send you the potential details and check in to see if you’re up for it, pick up little things for you, checks in if you need anything etc.\nEmotional response to you can be unclear/hard to read in person, and is expressed through writing (where to be fair, it is clear). The disparity between in person and writing can be pretty confusing and takes a while to get used to\nSexual attraction to you also harder to gauge if not explicitly brought up\nLess focus in general on the arts/conventional fun/aesthetically pleasing/hedonistic side of life (this one may be most personal-to-me: I happen to think a more balance is nice for a whole host of reasons)\nHe washes his weetabix. With water. In the sink. And then eats it just like that. He claims he “just rinses it” or something to this degree (can’t recall the exact phrasing), but I’m not certain this is much better. On the bright side, he did this with no shame one of the first times he came to my house, and was (and remains) entirely unapologetic about it. If you are going to be the kind of man who does this, leaning in is probably good =).\nImages\nI try to avoid being photographed as best I can, so a representative\nsample is not possible. I detest wearing suits, but black & white is\nfine.\nSuitability\nAs is hopefully obvious to most readers of this document, the\npopulation size of those who want to date me is small (but crucially\nnon-zero). If that’s not you but you would like to message me out of\ngeneral interest/friendship/matchmaking-with-someone-else purposes, I’m\nall ears. I can share a semi-secret personal blog if you would like to\nread more of my musings.\nAction\nIf enough of this sounds like it’s up your street, then feel free to\ncontact me at\nAndrewEADateMe@gmail.com\nwith any questions,\na funny dad-joke, and/or any relevant details/links about yourself and\nwe can take it from there.\nDisclaimer(s)\nI may have given a slightly misleading impression of how\nmathematically minded I am in the\n“My\nInterests”\ntable for comedic purposes. I basically find almost any\ntopic that requires thinking to be interesting and worth discussing. But\nI cannot hide that I am an enthusiastically mathematical person and this\nwas my best way of making that very clear and filtering out people who\nmight find that off-putting.\n(*): If you scrolled to the end (thank you!), then I expect you’re\nsufficiently interested but non-mathematical\n1\n, so to be clear I’ll\nprobably be in my early 30s when you’re reading this. If this statement\nis incorrect then it’s probably safe to say hardly anyone is reading\nthis by then and/or I might have forgotten I have made this document or\nnot bothered to exhaustively debug all dates.\nOr mathematical-enough to work it out yet mildly lazy,\nwhich is fine by me - the best maths is motivated by lethargy! I did\nconsider writing some Javascript to dynamically change the document\nbased on the current date, but I’m definitely too lazy for that.\n↩︎"

Naturopathic medicine blends modern scientific research with natural and traditional forms of medicine to help activate the body's inherent ability to heal. The focus is not just on managing symptoms, but on addressing the underlying causes of illness by treating the whole person—mind, body, and spirit. We serve as a doctor and a teacher, empowering the patient with the knowledge and personalized tools, like nutrition and lifestyle counseling, to achieve and maintain optimal health.\r\n* My LinkedIn \r\nLong Term Aspirations:\r\n* Host gatherings on a forested property in the PNW with a garden, sauna, and other homesteading features\r\n* Raise 1-2 children with conscious parenting\r\n* Open a private practice\r\n* Write a book\r\n* Continue to travel the world \r\n* Live a long life full of love, wisdom, and depth\r\nWhat I do for fun:\r\n* Social: dinner parties, potlucks, intentional relating (Authentic Relating, Circling)\r\n* Mind-Body: Vipassana meditation, sauna and cold plunge, plant medicine\r\n* Nature: forest bathing, backpacking, hiking, camping \r\n* Dance: Contact Improvisation, Butoh, Ecstatic Dance\r\n* Performance art: Clown, Social Practice\r\n* Sports: Badminton, Pickleball, Tennis, Bouldering, White water kayaking\r\n* Music: DJ Monel on Soundcloud \r\nPersonality:\r\n* Astrology: Sagittarius Sun, Aquarius Moon, Cancer Ascendant\r\n* Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving)\r\n* Human Design: Manifesting Generator\r\n* Chinese Astrology: Year of the Dragon\r\n* I am grounded, logical, and have emotional maturity\r\n* I am good at advocating my needs\r\n* I am low technology and try to be off screens as much as possible\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMovement and Nourishment \r\n\r\n\r\nA little story about me:\r\nI was born in Seoul, Korea and moved to west Los Angeles when I was 9 months old. My father had lived most of his adult life in the US and wanted to get his MBA at USC. I attended Carlthorp School then Marlborough School, and undergrad at Williams College in western Massachusetts to become a contemporary art curator. Along the way I heavily pursued Buddhist psychology living at various Zen temples and Buddhist retreat centers. While learning German in Berlin, I discovered activist art and changed my major to Studio art when I returned to school. I won a travel scholar grant to study activist art in Korea and eventually focused on durational performance art and social practice. After college I lived at an intentional community for contact improvisation called Earthdance Creative Living Project where I studied Body-Mind Centering, Authentic Movement, and a host of other embodied anatomy movement practices. I returned to Los Angeles to study Continuum Movement with Emilie Conrad until she passed away in 2014. I decided to dedicate my career to combining somatics with medicine and completed post baccalaureate pre medical training at UCLA Extension while studying craniosacral therapy. That led me to the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland Oregon where I reside to this day. \r\n  Community/Friendships:\r\n* Fernhill Ecstatic Dance\r\n* Thursday Night Contact Improvisation\r\n* Korean American Coalition, KAC Oregon\r\n                \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks That Have Shaped Me:\r\n   * New Self, New World by Philip Shepherd  \r\n   * The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle\r\n   * Unlimiting Mind: The Radically Experiential Psychology of Buddhism by Andrew Olendzki \r\nValues:\r\n   * Universal love\r\n   * Sovereignty\r\n   * Curiosity and open mindedness \r\n   * Taking initiative \r\n   * Integrity\r\n   * Growth mindset \r\n   * Kindness\r\n   * Generosity\r\n   * Empathy\r\n   * Optimism\r\n   * Nonjudgement\r\n   * Unattachment\r\n   * Creativity\r\n   * “Seek first to understand”\r\nWhat others have said:\r\n   * Words about me\r\n   * “You have one of the most vital energies of someone I have felt” - Akash Gama\r\n   * “I have smelled a lot of people, but you have the rolls royce of smells” - Dean Evans \r\n   * “5/5 stars, would date again” “You have great genes, you should definitely procreate” - Phil Illy \r\n   * “Your voice is so soothing, I could listen to you all day.” Thom LaFond\r\nRelationship\r\nGeneral compatibility stuff:\r\n   * Gender/Orientation:\r\n   * Pansexual female \r\n   * Religion:\r\n   * Raised Protestant, currently none \r\n   * Recreational substances\r\n   * Non smoker (no tobacco or cannabis), seldom drinker (wine tasting yes)\r\n   * Entheogens \r\n   * Soon-to-be licensed psilocybin facilitator \r\n   * Politics\r\n   * Apolitical, issue-based bipartisan \r\n   * Lifestyle\r\n   * Diet: whole foods, home cooking, occasional processed foods\r\n   * Environmental: scent-free, avoid microplastic and petroleum based products \r\n   * Fitness\r\n   * Yoga, running, outdoor sports\r\nRelationship Intentions and preparation: \r\n   * Do you know how to regulate your nervous system after getting triggered?\r\n   * Do you know what unresolved relational patterns or attachment wounds you could potentially be bringing into the relationship? \r\n   * What are your relationship boundaries/needs/requests/demands - do you know the difference between each, and do you know how to clearly communicate them? \r\n   * Do you know what your heart needs to feel safe and connected? \r\n   * Are you able to fully accept and enjoy love without suspicion, doubt, or the constant anxiety that something bad is inevitably going to happen? \r\n   * Do you know the difference between your inner child's needs and your adult self's needs in a relationship? \r\n   * Do you have clarity around what you actually want from a relationship? \r\n   * Have you been emotionally available to yourself in these ways? \r\n   * Are you emotionally available to the love you're seeking? \r\nI like people who:\r\n   * Eat vegetables and whole foods, generally avoid processed food \r\n   * Have a relationship with nature and the earth\r\n   * Meditate regularly or have attended meditation retreats\r\n   * Have participated in counseling, therapy or are familiar with self-reflection\r\n   * Practice embodiment and feel comfortable in their own skin\r\n   * Have a growth mindset and have experience with improving behaviors\r\n   * Are free of substance use or addiction\r\n   * Have experienced oneness and mind-expansive states through fasting, plant medicine, meditation, chanting, or prayer\r\n   * Have earned-secure or secure attachment\r\n   * Want to live a long healthy life and take care of their body\r\n   * Have deep relationships with people in their community \r\n   * Express positive regard with current and past relationships \r\n   * Have emotional and financial stability\r\n   * Are supportive of me fostering close friendships which include platonic affection\r\nHow I resolve conflict: \r\n   * With Nonviolent communication or thoughtful language\r\n   * If escalated conflict, ask a third party for mediation\r\nThings you should know about me in relationships:\r\nLifestyle\r\nTypical week night\r\nTypical weekend \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get in touch: \r\nFeel free to email me or add me on Facebook/ping me on Messenger about what resonated, what you’re working on, thinking about, or learning lately!"

      "fullText": "﻿Rahul’s Date-Me-Doc\r\nAs of Oct 2025\r\n________________\r\nAbout Me\r\nHey, I’m Rahul, an Indian-born-German living in Berlin for over 6 years.\r\nAge: 29 years young\r\nHeight: 178.5 cm\r\nLanguages: English, German, Hindi, plans to learn Spanish\r\nZodiac: Aries (I don't believe in it, but maybe it matters to you)\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality Snapshot\r\nEmotionally steady, reliable, and funny in a dry, situational way. I'm not carrying any past traumas (not that I know of) and I don't plan to acquire one in the future either.\r\nI’m a planner at heart —  I like to plan and organise things. Events, trips, life in general. You can join the planning.. or just follow. But at the same time I’ll also say yes to a spontaneous “Let’s go to Budapest tomorrow.”\r\nI’m generally extroverted, though I start off a bit shy. Once comfortable, I’m quite playful, occasionally awkward, and sometimes philosophical. I’m a lot more romantic (and sarcastic) than I let out in the first meeting.\r\nWhat else\r\n* I don't have a pet but I like dogs — personally believe Huskies are the best.\r\n* Can assemble IKEA furniture without (much) damage.\r\n* I also curate Spotify playlists for every mood — except sadness.\r\nMy life can sometimes be a bit chaotic and other times super calm. I love both sides of it.\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n\r\nLifestyle & Hobbies\r\nOutdoors - Hiking, gym, (ice) skating, dancing, swimming, walks, runs, anything that gets me moving (except biking in Berlin weather).\r\n\r\n\r\nIndoor Fun - Karaokes, cooking, dancing, game nights, movie nights, plant care, thinking of home improvement ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\nNote that dancing is present in both Outdoor and Indoors :D \r\n\r\nI love water bodies and like to spend time around one whenever possible. Beaches, lakes, rivers, bathtubs…whatever I can find.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to socialise and occasionally party (like once a month), but unlike most such people I don't need any external ‘help’ to have fun. In general I have a high social energy which I don't expect my partner to match 100% but maybe meet halfway there. \r\nOh, and I also love dancing Salsa (cuban style) - a bit off-beat, but full of enthusiasm.\r\nWhen cooking I am always trying new things to get that perfect Sunday breakfast. Sometimes I have tears of joy, other times just tears. My current speciality is ‘Cheese Avocado Toasts and Poached eggs’\r\nIn general I have a very adaptable lifestyle — candle light dinners, lake days, clubs, saunas, jump house, raves — I am down for everything! Pick your vibe :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing that I enjoy the most is ‘a new experience’. I will almost always say yes to a new activity that I haven’t done before. \r\n________________\r\n  \r\n\r\nThings That Matter to Me\r\nImportant: Health & Fitness - I don't smoke, don’t consume drugs and drink very little alcohol and eat ‘relatively healthy’. I also like to maintain an overall fit lifestyle by regular workouts and runs. I take care of myself and like people who do too. Almost 30 and no back pain!\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant: Ambitions (self improvement) - I like having a vision or goals in every phase of life — Career, Fitness, Learning, Travelling. It doesn't matter big or small but I like it when I am constantly moving forward otherwise life starts to stagnate. I’d love a partner who also has her own direction in life. \r\n\r\n\r\nKindness > Coolness - I’m drawn to warmth, patience, and people who treat others well. I understand a lot of men confuse a girl being nice with flirting, which can be extremely annoying, but I still hope that this doesn't become a reason for being rude to other people.\r\n\r\n\r\nI value emotional honesty, curiosity, and people who ask questions that don’t have simple answers. I love when someone can challenge me, tease me, and make ordinary moments memorable. And I would do the same for them. \r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nbut.. Red flags (because honesty is hot)\r\nUnfortunately I'm not perfect. I have red flags too that you should know about.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I listen to Christmas songs in January\r\n* I can eat spice but at times I overestimate my spice tolerance…\r\n* Strong urge to say something funny in a serious situation.\r\n* I can’t drive yet but love road trips (backseat DJ unlocked). Going through the License process right now.\r\n________________\r\n💫 What I’m Looking For (And Also What I Provide)\r\nEvery one is different and I don’t expect anyone to be exactly how I want. We all have our strengths and flaws, but that is also what makes us beautiful and keeps our life exciting. But I am still hoping to find someone who is emotionally aware, funny and knows how to both talk and listen. I value relationships where both people have independence and togetherness in balance.\r\nMy love language - Physical touch, words of encouragement, thoughtful gestures and making each other laugh. And yours?\r\nI believe connection grows through curiosity, effort, honesty, laughter, and showing up — even when it’s not perfect (especially when it's not perfect!). Ideally we shouldn't be threatened by an existential crisis for every single unplanned change happening around us. \r\nBonus points if you:\r\n* Loves music or dancing (or tolerates my off-beat dancing).\r\n* Enjoys long walks or spontaneous trips.\r\n* Would make flirty gestures while I cook dinner ;)\r\nI believe before sharing a happy life together, we should each be happy on our own. Relationships won’t erase the ups and downs — they just make the ride a little warmer and funnier. If we cannot handle issues in our single life then we will struggle in relationships too.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. A little secret: The more you flirt with me while I’m cooking, the better the food gets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe we could be a match feel free to reach out to me on rahulgoyal.rago@gmail.com or https://www.instagram.com/ra_go_/ or telegram on @RaGo2203. Or if you know someone else who you think would be a good match for me then forward it to them :)"

I enjoy philosophy, science, nature, and mindful physical activity, living simply while prioritizing honesty and meaningful relationships.\nDetailed Description\nI  speak English and French fluently and I’m currently in Europe, but I have recently lived in the US (for 4 years) and India (for 6 months). I'm mostly looking for\nCollaborations: working together on a joint project that we enjoy. I started Compass, and I'm actively looking for ambassadors to volunteer together and share the platform with their network! We could have meetings and discuss how to reach the people who would benefit from it the most. Regardless, hit me up if you have anything to say about Compass! I'm also happy to work on any other project we find meaningful.\nFriendships: mostly to discuss online and share deeper things (see details below).\nLife partnership: with a woman who deeply resonates with what I wrote below.\nCore Values\nHighly stable and non-negotiable guiding principles that shape my worldview, decisions, and moral framework.\nIntellectual curiosity with rational integrity: I evaluate beliefs against evidence and enjoy conversations that challenge and expand my thinking.\nEthical responsibility / Utilitarian-leaning ethics: I consciously act to reduce suffering and improve outcomes on a large scale—through causes like animal welfare, climate change, AI safety, and global poverty.\nEmotional stability and resilience: I remain calm under stress, self-soothe effectively, and approach conflicts with reason rather than panic or overreaction.\nDeep, loving relationships: I thrive in profound 1-on-1 connections where accountability, honesty, and mutual growth are prioritized.\nGrowth-oriented conflict resolution: I engage in solution-focused dialogue, tolerate relational discomfort, and prioritize repair over avoidance.\nIntegrity & deliberateness: I aim to live according to my principles and consciously cultivate trust, depth, and clarity during relationships.\nTolerance for differences: I’m very willing to connect with people who fit more than 70% of these values, embracing trade-offs and growth together.\nLifestyle & Secondary Values\nTraits or principles that matter to me, but are negotiable or context-dependent. Mostly applying to life partnerships—not friendships.\nLife Vision & Practicalities:\nGeography: I enjoy living in Europe but am open to relocate if circumstances align.\nFamily: I’d like 1–2 children within roughly 5–10 years, depending on mutual readiness.\nCareer / lifestyle: I support a partner’s work and ambitions, as long as we can spend meaningful time together (2+ hours most days).\nFinancial approach: I live frugally, saving or donating the rest, but am comfortable if my partner spends more on things meaningful to her.\nAttachment & Intimacy Needs\nConflict & repair: I notice when someone is hurt, but I do not chase them if they withdraw. I prefer calm, constructive conversations when both sides are ready. Because I'll care about you, I'll express it when I think you may be wrong—at the same time, I'll always have your back.\nEmotional intelligence: I’m aware of my emotions and take time to process before responding, which helps me stay calm in tense moments. I try to express my feelings honestly, listen carefully to understand others, and take responsibility when I misstep. I believe that, with mutual effort, we can keep strengthening our emotional intelligence and connection as a healthy, securely attached couple.\nEmotional expressiveness: More through words, modest body language and thoughtful gifts than grand gestures.\nPreferred intimacy style: I enjoy direct and meaningful connections—long dedicated conversations over frequent, shallow texts. I seek a monogamous relationship.\nLifestyle Habits & Daily Rhythms:\nDietary choices: Mostly vegan; I strongly value sensitivity to animal well-being.\nSleep & energy patterns: Typically 11pm–8am; similar routines are a plus.\nExercise & health: Small-group activities several times per week. Open to mental health practices to improve relationships and wellbeing.\nSocial engagement: Few close friendships; comfortable connecting with more socially active or community-involved partners.\nFamily engagement: Average.\nMinimalism: I live a simple and non-performative life without clutter, in order to focus on what truly matters.\nEmotional & Cognitive Style:\nHumor: Mix of wit, playful absurdity, and sarcasm.\nTolerance for uncertainty: Comfortable with ambiguity, but appreciate clear plans when possible.\nRomantic philosophy: Love grows deliberately; romance and thoughtful gestures (e.g., poems) are enjoyable once fundamental compatibilities are aligned.\nRole expectations: Prefer equal partnership, but open to specialization if mutually desired.\nInterests & Activities\nActivities or pursuits I enjoy but that don’t define my ethics or essential lifestyle.\nIntellectual pursuits: Reading nonfiction, exploring philosophy, science, history, and practical wisdom; hands-on learning through building and fixing things.\nDeep conversation: Intense, thoughtful dialogue with like-minded people.\nOptimization & personal growth: Exploring methods to improve life, productivity, and learning practices.\nNature & mindfulness: Contemplative walks or time in natural landscapes; pausing to observe wildlife or scenery inspires awe.\nPhysical activities: Running, biking, swimming, weightlifting—often integrated with mindfulness.\nInfluences\nContents that majorly influenced my worldview.\nBooks:\nThinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman\nThe Art of Living a Meaningless Existence - Robert Pantano\nLe Petit Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\nL’étranger - Albert Camus\nExistential Physics - Sabine Hossenfelder\nThe Big Picture - Sean Carroll\nDoing Good Better - William MacAskill\nEmotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman\nWaking Up - Sam Harris\nDeep Work - Cal Newport\nSapiens - Yuval Noah Harari\nBeing the Change - Peter Kalmus\nYouTube channels:\nThe Pursuit of Wonder\nKurzgesagt\nFeel free to send recommendations or discuss any content you like!\nAbout You\nTo an imperfect extent, I like who I am and what I do, and would like to see it in the people around me. So, I’m mostly looking for people who identify—at least partially—with the description above and would enjoy the same activities. I believe in growth and potential; so I embrace people who are not there yet (so am I) but have, deep inside, the intention to reach it.\nAs long as you fit some of the description, relationships, to me, transcend gender, age, culture, financial situation, or any other socio-demographic factors; please reach out to me regardless of your situation if you relate to my personality traits. Locations should not be an issue either (a priori); I’ve had close long-distance friendships which worked beautifully for me.\nAbout Us\nI would love to form a close friendship with 3-5 people, and one life partnership with a woman. If you want a shallower connection, that’s also okay; maybe we can still contribute to each other’s lives.\nI'm also looking for collaboration, whether on Compass or any other project which I would be aligned with.\nWhile some key relationship values, such as depth and trust, grow over time, there is one value which, I believe, should be there from the start: honesty. In this regard, please be honest about your intentions—which may include different types of relationships depending on how it evolves, and that’s okay.\nThings I'm currently exploring and I'd like to discuss with whoever is interested:\nPopulation ethics in utilitarianism (total view vs neutral / person affective, longtermism, What we owe the future from MacAskill)\nMoral realism vs anti-realism, the different sub types of anti-realism, mostly constructivism and non-cognitivism (Bertrand Russell, Sean Carroll)\nConsciousness, and whether the hard problem is really a problem\nDo multidisciplinary research / PhD across science and philosophy\nIf emotional intelligence, unlike IQ, is context-dependent (one can have high EI with one type of person, and low EI with another), how important is it to have high EI across all contexts? What proportion of EI is objective (high across all contexts)?\nEffective altruism\nDisclaimers\nThis document desperately lacks elaboration, emotions, and personal information for privacy reasons. I have no issue sharing about my life story, what I look like, what I feel and think, vulnerability, intimacy, and other personal features in private.\nEndorsements\nIf you know them, write something nice that adds to their profile."

      "fullText": "﻿I’m Mark, nice to meet you!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe basics   \r\n* 35 years old\r\n* Child-free, open to children\r\n* Located in East Anglia (England)\r\n* Non-smoker\r\n* Head of Support in the Education sector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me   \r\nI’ve lived in East Anglia now for just over 15 years and whilst I love it here, I’m absolutely willing to consider moving to different parts of the country. I have a dream to move to a remote Scottish island one day and have a little self-sustaining farm!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve been described by my friends as kind, selfless and intelligent. I am very curious to learn and to experience new things, I’m always looking for little trips away and new sports and activities to try!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI used to run my own music business in Norfolk, so have quite a few stories to tell about bands/artists I’ve met! Music has always been a big part of my life - I’m a 90s child but 80s-00s music is where I find myself most days! \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI very much enjoy cooking - it’s one of my passions. I make an excellent roast dinner and a Sunday isn’t complete without one! That being said, I enjoy going out to restaurants too - though nothing beats an amazing home cooked meal. Especially an autumnal crumble - can’t go wrong with an apple and blackberry crumble dessert!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI’d say my best personality feature is that I am a very caring person. I have a lot of pride in being there for people - being a good friend is important to me and similarly, being a good partner to someone is something I hold a lot of value in. I show my kindness through actions and words and I like that those in my life feel I am a positive presence in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for?\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for the type of person who would have one of these documents! Somebody who’s curious about the world, intelligent and is looking to explore life together.\r\n  \r\n I prioritise emotional connections with others ahead of physical, so I’d very much like to meet somebody who is also looking for an emotional connection and somebody to share experiences with. That doesn’t mean I’m not looking for a physical connection (as that’s important, too!); I just prioritise connecting with the person on an intellectual level as well!  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn terms of a partner, it would be great to meet somebody who is active, fun and whose idea of a good weekend is going for a walk somewhere along a beach, exploring a new city or getting lost in nature! Bonus points if you have a dog we can take for walks - I haven’t got a dog yet but would like to!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI’d probably describe myself as an introverted extrovert - I love doing new things, seeing new places etc but I’m definitely more of a ‘smaller crowds’ sort of person. My nightclub days are well behind my now, I’d much rather an evening walking to a country pub and sitting in front of a fire there with a board game and some great company!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nI’m looking for someone who takes an interest in things - not necessarily being interested in the same sort of things as me, but who has a curious mind and enjoys learning about things. I’ve got an interest in space things (the Northern Lights, seeing comets etc) which pops up every so often so someone who’d enjoy hearing about random facts I learn would be ideal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’d be lovely to hear from you - I’m looking to make more connections generally in life, so even if not for a date you can never have too many friends, right? 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to email me at canariesfc@gmail.com and we can chat!"

      "fullText": "﻿🌉 Jamie\r\nBasic details. 22, cishet male, allistic, INFJ 5w4.\r\nLooking for. Rationalist friends (or a companion) with utilitarian-ish or sympathetic views.\r\nPhilosophy & Me\r\nThree passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.\r\nThe eloquent Bertrand Russell (who penned the above at 84) was my gateway to philosophy (and for a fun contrast, The Good Place my gateway to ethics). I’ve always liked learning, but only philosophy has taught, and continues to teach, me to reconsider my epistemic limits and moral blind spots, to resist the norm of prejudging issues and perspectives, and to respect cognitive diversity.\r\nI don’t live and breathe philosophy, but I find myself on a closer wavelength to those on whom it has made a similar impact.\r\nLifestyle\r\nTraits:\r\n* 🐢 Introverted and more comfortable in cozy places and 1-on-1 chinwags than in large crowds (though I love a jaunt through the city).\r\n* 🌱 Active, not athletic, and health-conscious, 5’9”. I have no experience with drugs or drinking, though not for highly principled reasons.\r\n* 💞 Eager to banter with and support those whom I care about.\r\nHobbies:\r\n* 🎸 Guitar and singing.\r\n* 📚 Reading, mainly philosophy, short stories, psychology (Jonathan Haidt, Joshua Greene), and politics (in moderation). Currently enjoying a book on AI alignment and writing an overview of theories of consciousness!\r\n* 🍛 Cooking.\r\n* 🎮 Video games.\r\n* 💻 UX design.\r\n* 👐 Occasional volunteering.\r\nAmbitions:\r\n* Graduated and have my sights on a philosophy MA next. In the long term, I’m partial to teaching and/or doing public philosophy as I’ve done before, supplementing with UX work if needed. Above all I hope to meet a special someone with whom I can devote time to mutual growth and advocating.\r\nNon-negotiables\r\n* 🫶 Empathy and open-mindedness (i.e., non-dogmatism), especially in communication. I strive always to be nonjudgy and an active listener.\r\nBeliefs\r\n* Value Realism. There are objectively good and bad things. It’s common to misinterpret this view as necessitating a commitment to a free-floating abstractum, goodness (or The Good) and the like. Not so. Value is a property of things, like squareness and loudness are properties of bread and bellbirds, respectively; affirming these properties doesn’t imply belief in a free-floating squareness or loudness. Acknowledging this point preempts the oft-made “argument” for skepticism that, since we don’t perceive abstracta, it’s dubious how we could “see” the goodness or badness of anything; the proper response here is that while we don’t see moral value itself, we see instances thereof, akin to seeing tori in donuts or finitude in a life.\r\n* Utilitarianism. As for my view of what instances value, I think feelings or experiences do, informally speaking. This is, in effect, hedonism, a nicely parsimonious theory of value that, when conjoined with other plausible tenets, yields classical utilitarianism—I believe the most plausible moral theory. Some views I consider allies: impartialism, suffering-focused ethics, “deontology for people, utilitarianism for animals.”\r\n* Anti-speciesism. Of the moral blind spots I’ve been led to reconsider, perhaps none do I regret failing to notice more than the belief that our species is justified in mistreating others if and because ours is more powerful, intelligent, or whatever. This type of sophistry runs through numerous exclusionary ideologies–male supremacy, racial supremacy, tribalism, Aryanism–and should, I believe, be laid to rest. There are rational, logical grounds for extending moral concern to all experiencing beings (but know I don’t judge anyone for failing to act consistently with their values; nobody’s perfect, least of all me).\r\n* Politics. My politics square with my ethics (e.g. pro-foreign aid, pro-gender equality); as general descriptors, ‘democrat,’ ‘liberal,’ and ‘progressive’ fit me!\r\n* Religion. I’m an atheist—though I do admit the existence of some intriguing arguments for a creator! But even if I did become more sympathetic to theism, it’s unlikely it would influence my ethics or lifestyle.\r\n* Spirituality v. ineffability. Many hold the intuition that there exists a “higher power” that is not necessarily God. While I don’t think this is unreasonable, I confess I cannot relate and so remain skeptical (as I likewise am of claims that meditation/drugs/NDE’s can transmit spiritual knowledge). To be clear, I emphatically accept that certain states (e.g. love, grief) are inexplicable and that you can reasonably believe something even if that thing isn’t scientifically verifiable/testable. However I resist the idea that one’s altered state can “show them” a posteriori spiritual truths (unless “spiritual” is used loosely like “sublime”). Perhaps this is close-minded of me. Ultimately though, I’d prefer (more so for a potential companion) that any gaps between our beliefs and formative experiences can be adequately overcome. (If you are spiritual, I’ll do my best to be understanding, not resistant.) Perhaps this should be our first conversation starter (;\r\nIf you’d like to get to know me more (even if only to gain a chat/debate pal), reach out via the Contact Form, please and tysm 😇\r\n(Recent)"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi! I’m Rory. I’m a kind, thoughtful, sensitive person with strong opinions who cares deeply about the people in her life. I really want to start a family and I’m looking for the right person to do that with. I’m looking for a partner to have kids with; if you’re interested in something else, I’m flattered, but that’s not my focus right now. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasics about me:\r\n* I’m 38 years old\r\n* Pretty straight\r\n* Currently live in the East Bay but open to relocating under the right circumstances\r\n* Originally from the Philadelphia area, moved to the Bay two years ago. Have also lived periods of my life and feel deeply connected to NYC and Baltimore\r\n* Never been married\r\n* Want to have kids and to that end, have frozen eggs\r\n\r\n\r\nDeeper things about me:\r\n* I’m a community builder. I love co-hosting events and bringing together groups of people who might not otherwise come together. I’ve hosted Shabbat meals that have manifested in two marriages!\r\n* Connection oriented. I care deeply about my relationships with others. \r\n* Spiritually oriented. Professionally, I’m a rabbi. Of course it’s a longer story but at the heart of it, I became a rabbi because I like teaching, counseling, community building, and religious/spiritual questions. Happy to tell you more in person about what it entails. \r\n* Self-reflective and growth-oriented\r\n* Intellectually curious\r\n* Good with kids. I teach a unique Hebrew school program to a group of 8-10 year olds, and I love the chance to help kids develop on their spiritual journeys.\r\n* Embodied–while I tend to spend my professional life doing a lot of cognitively-oriented work, I’m happiest when I’m moving my body or engaging with my senses\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies: \r\n* I love spending as much time outside as possible. I most routinely go on hikes with my dog but I love dabbling in other outdoor activities like backpacking and kayaking when I get a chance. I love trying new things—some things currently on my list include windsurfing, classic surfing, and horseback riding.\r\n* I’m a former theater kid and still love going to see performances of all sorts. I love using theater games and skills in my work life, and I might get back into it recreationally at some point. \r\n* Since moving to the Bay, I’ve been exploring partner dancing. In particular, I enjoy Fusion and Contra. I’m not particularly talented at it but it brings me a lot of joy and has been a fun way to build community.\r\n* I’m an amateur climber and runner. I do these things for my health but they’re not things I’m particularly ambitious about. \r\n* Things I’d like to do more of: reading, writing, art making, cooking.\r\n* Currently perfecting my coffee-banana smoothie recipe\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for:\r\n* Someone who is excited about having a family\r\n* Someone who is interested in emotions. They’re a big part of my life.\r\n* Someone who is intellectually curious. I love discussing ideas and learning new things.\r\n* Doesn’t have to be Jewish but someone who is interested in engaging spiritually and is a little curious about Judaism at least\r\n* Someone who is sex positive\r\n* Someone who cares about having a positive impact on the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould be great:\r\n* Someone who likes the outdoors and being active\r\n* Someone who likes wordplay\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I hope for out of a life together:\r\n* Love and affection\r\n* Much time for play, fun, and silliness (i’m really into this kind of thing)\r\n* But also committed to collaboration on the domestic tasks and errands of daily life (hopefully with lots of wide-ranging conversation and dance breaks)\r\n* Conflict that is respectful and patient and is an opportunity to deepen the relationship\r\n* Developing little traditions (religious or not) that remind us to appreciate ourselves, each other, our community, and our world\r\n* Working together to foster connection to greater community\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat my friends say about me:\r\n* Incredibly infectious smile\r\n* Bold but thoughtful\r\n* Compassionate and tender-hearted\r\n* Is sensitive and attuned in a way that helps others feel more present and get in touch with their own sensitivity\r\n* Exceptional listener, sits with discomfort and comfortable with silences and pauses\r\n* Deeply curious about the world\r\n* Loves words and wordplay, will care about why you chose a word or a thought and what it means\r\n* Has a friendly, lazy hypoallergenic little dog named Arlene (after the dog in a favorite children’s book)\r\nSome dates that would excite me:\r\n* Going to the farmer’s market or Berkeley Bowl and talking about the produce\r\n* Splitting an unusual pastry at a bakery\r\n* Sipping tea or a weird coffee drink\r\n* Any kind of hike\r\n* Any kind of public art\r\n* Anything else that involves moving our bodies\r\nIf you think you might be a match, please email me at rory.katz [at] gmail.com!"

(\nwhat is a date me doc?\n)\nGeorge Wang\n31 / male / 6'1\"\nLocation:\nSF (flexible)\nRelationship type:\nStraight, monogamous\nKids:\nMaybe? Ask me about it\nMy pronouns are he/him but they could be all/yours :)\nMy love language is sending people more blog posts / essays than anyone can reasonably be expected to read\nAbout me\nOne of my more load-bearing beliefs is that the world is fundamentally malleable to our actions. That the world can be a better place, that we have the power to improve it, and that\nwe should\ntry\n.\nThe main way I currently relate to this is through technological progress. I think AI is going to make the next decade\nreally weird\n, and not all in good ways. As soon as I was convinced this was true, I dropped what I was doing to\nfocus on making this societal transition safer\n. This was a difficult decision with various sacrifices, the most legible of which was a ~75% pay cut (I'm lucky to have financial stability from some earlier successes), but I think this was the right thing to do and I'm glad I did.\nAnother of my defining values is growth: I see myself as a constant work in progress. This means many things to me — being a better friend, a better partner, a better citizen. It means being a sharper scientist as much as it means healing old emotional wounds, and it means developing better habits as much as it means figuring out how to relate to my existential angst.\nThe way I move through and understand the world is fairly\nBay Area rationalist\ncoded, which sometimes makes me seem like a system-2-robot kind of person, but I think I have at least as much system-1-hopeless-idealist in me.\n(more recently on a \"postrat\" arc, though I kinda think the distinction is wrong? anyways, mostly this looks like getting much more interested in buddhism)\nI take commitments seriously, which might come off as \"reliable\" to some people and \"annoyingly conscientious\" to others.\nThe world is full of side quests and I regularly get nerd-sniped by them. I've built an automated arbitrage bot for\nMtG:O\n(and eventually got banned 😬), dabbled in sports betting, made a couple of\nsmall games\n, and occasionally drop everything I'm doing to chase down alpha in financial markets.\nI'm a bit of a dork and love games. One of my favorite framing of games is as\nart working in the medium of agency\n. I see games as a place to be playful, to be creative, to laugh, to cry, to feel both joy and fear, to compete, and to face challenges and overcome them.\nIf you like my writing, you'll probably like talking to me. A few that I like that aren't too domain specific:\nMy PhD cost me $1.17M (but I'd do it again)\n,\nSharing is caring\n,\nNavigating burnout\nAbout you\nThese are things I'm fairly sure I want:\nYou have strong values. We don't have to share all of them, but there are things that matter to you that you'd defend (they don't have to be grand, world-shattering things).\nYou're proactive about shaping your life. When you run into problems or see opportunities, you jump in.\nYou're kind and empathetic towards others. You try even when it's hard, including those you might not personally like or agree with.\nYou're deeply curious about the world. You care about what's true and want to learn together.\nYou're playful! Fun is a terminal value :)\n(To be clear, I'm not perfect at all of these myself!)\nAbout... us? 👉👈\nEarly dates might be activities where it's easy to talk at the same time: hikes, bouldering, board games, cooking dinner together, etc. A lot of early bonding happens through talking and texting for me.\nAfter we're a bit more comfortable, we might hang out more frequently, stay the night regularly, and text throughout the day about\nincreasingly mundane things\n(live-tweeting your life to someone is a real love language, fight me). I also enjoy just being in the same room, so if you also work remotely, we might cowork together often.\nLong-term, I'd like to live together and build our relationship into a source of mutual growth. It sounds super cliche but I mean it sincerely – I'd love to have a partnership where we keep inspiring each other to be better. I also travel a decent amount for work reasons (mostly conferences), but usually in great places to visit (last year was unusually travel-heavy, but I visited Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Melbourne, and the Bay Area). It's always nice to tack some extra time on either end, and a travel partner would be even better!\nI have an okay amount of social energy but am more introvert than extrovert and have decided that I mostly don't enjoy activities that involve lots of noise and not much personal space (concerts, clubs, etc). There are some exceptions, but in general I wouldn't expect this to be the kind of thing we regularly do together.\nI do like trips outdoors and would love to camp / hike / climb together!\nwe could\nboth\nbe laying here, dying of heat exhaustion\ntogether\nPossible dealbreakers?\nI don't politically identify as far left or far right. Socially, I tend to be more progressive, but otherwise I have somewhat scattered political positions.\nI'm not religious. I respect those who have deeply held religious beliefs, but this  probably means we understand the world in very fundamentally different ways.\nI lean towards lower thresholds for sensitivity to disgust. The kinds of compromises I try to aim for seemed to generally be fine in past relationships (and at least one partner was more germophobic than me), but if you have particularly high thresholds for disgust, this might generate friction.\nWhat next?\nThis is a fairly curated window into who I am, and reality is always more complicated. I don't know what the right discount factor is, but you should apply at least a little.\nIf you still feel interested, then reach out! Yes, you reading this doc. If you're not sure, please err on the side of getting in contact, that's what this thing is for! The downside might be a small time cost, and the upside is hugely positive for both of us. Don't leave that +EV on the table.\nEmail me\n, message me on\nTwitter\n, or ask a mutual friend to introduce us. No need for it to be a big deal either, just say hi and we can go from there!\nThis Is My True Name © 2025\nSign up\nPowered by Ghost"

      "fullText": "﻿Connections with Martin\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m always looking for ways to improve my life, and I believe that a few more close connections would greatly contribute to it—and, hopefully, to the life of others as well! \r\nI created this document with the prospect to form close friendships / relationships with like-minded people. If you relate to what I wrote below, I'd love to connect! You can simply contact me through this Connection Form.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a man in his late 20s speaking English and French fluently. I’m currently in Europe, but I have recently lived in the US (for 4 years) and India (for 6 months).\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Values\r\nHighly stable and non-negotiable guiding principles that shape my worldview, decisions, and moral framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Intellectual curiosity with rational integrity: I evaluate beliefs against evidence and enjoy conversations that challenge and expand my thinking.\r\n* Ethical responsibility / Utilitarian-leaning ethics: I consciously act to reduce suffering and improve outcomes on a large scale—through causes like animal welfare, climate change, AI safety, and global poverty.\r\n* Emotional stability and resilience: I remain calm under stress, self-soothe effectively, and approach conflicts with reason rather than panic or overreaction.\r\n* Deep, loving relationships: I thrive in profound 1-on-1 connections where accountability, honesty, and mutual growth are prioritized.\r\n* Growth-oriented conflict resolution: I engage in solution-focused dialogue, tolerate relational discomfort, and prioritize repair over avoidance.\r\n* Integrity & deliberateness: I aim to live according to my principles and consciously cultivate trust, depth, and clarity during relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nTolerance for differences: I’m very willing to connect with people who fit more than 70% of these values, embracing trade-offs and growth together.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle & Secondary Values\r\nTraits or principles that matter to me, but are negotiable or context-dependent. Mostly applying to life partnerships—not friendships.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife Vision & Practicalities:\r\n* Geography: I enjoy living in Europe but am open to relocate if circumstances align.\r\n* Family: I’d like 1–2 children within roughly 5–10 years, depending on mutual readiness.\r\n* Career / lifestyle: I support a partner’s work and ambitions, as long as we can spend meaningful time together (2+ hours most days).\r\n* Financial approach: I live frugally, saving or donating the rest, but am comfortable if my partner spends more on things meaningful to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment & Intimacy Needs\r\n* Conflict & repair: I notice when someone is hurt, but I do not chase them if they withdraw. I prefer calm, constructive conversations when both sides are ready. Because I'll care about you, I'll express it when I think you may be wrong—at the same time, I'll always have your back.\r\n* Emotional intelligence: I’m aware of my emotions and take time to process before responding, which helps me stay calm in tense moments. I try to express my feelings honestly, listen carefully to understand others, and take responsibility when I misstep. I believe that, with mutual effort, we can keep strengthening our emotional intelligence and connection as a healthy, securely attached couple.\r\n* Emotional expressiveness: More through words, modest body language and thoughtful gifts than grand gestures.\r\n* Preferred intimacy style: I enjoy direct and meaningful connections—long dedicated conversations over frequent, shallow texts. I seek a monogamous relationship.\r\n* Openness: Although I respect those who explore radical openness and playful experimentation, that is not my orientation. I do not engage much in norm-challenging lifestyles or social experiments—particularly around sex, relationships, or identity. I value seriousness, loyalty, and stability in these domains and approach them with depth rather than playfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle Habits & Daily Rhythms:\r\n* Dietary choices: Mostly vegan; I strongly value sensitivity to animal well-being.\r\n* Sleep & energy patterns: Typically 11pm–8am; similar routines are a plus.\r\n* Exercise & health: Small-group activities several times per week. Open to mental health practices to improve relationships and wellbeing.\r\n* Social engagement: Few close friendships; comfortable connecting with more socially active or community-involved partners.\r\n* Family engagement: Average.\r\n* Minimalism: I live a simple and non-performative life without clutter, in order to focus on what truly matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional & Cognitive Style:\r\n* Humor: Mix of wit, playful absurdity, and sarcasm.\r\n* Tolerance for uncertainty: Comfortable with ambiguity, but appreciate clear plans when possible.\r\n* Romantic philosophy: Love grows deliberately; romance and thoughtful gestures (e.g., poems) are enjoyable once fundamental compatibilities are aligned.\r\n* Role expectations: Prefer equal partnership, but open to specialization if mutually desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterests & Activities\r\nActivities or pursuits I enjoy but that don’t define my ethics or essential lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Intellectual pursuits: Reading nonfiction, exploring philosophy, science, history, and practical wisdom; hands-on learning through building and fixing things.\r\n* Deep conversation: Intense, thoughtful dialogue with like-minded people.\r\n* Optimization & personal growth: Exploring methods to improve life, productivity, and learning practices.\r\n* Nature & mindfulness: Contemplative walks or time in natural landscapes; pausing to observe wildlife or scenery inspires awe.\r\n* Physical activities: Running, biking, swimming, weightlifting—often integrated with mindfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluences\r\nContents that majorly influenced my worldview.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks:\r\n* Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman    \r\n* The Art of Living a Meaningless Existence - Robert Pantano\r\n* Le Petit Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\r\n* L’étranger - Albert Camus\r\n* Existential Physics - Sabine Hossenfelder\r\n* The Big Picture - Sean Carroll\r\n* Doing Good Better - William MacAskill\r\n* Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman\r\n* Waking Up - Sam Harris\r\n* Deep Work - Cal Newport\r\n* Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari\r\n* Being the Change - Peter Kalmus\r\n\r\n\r\nYouTube channels:\r\n* The Pursuit of Wonder\r\n* Kurzgesagt\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to send recommendations or discuss any content you like!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout You\r\n\r\n\r\nTo an imperfect extent, I like who I am and what I do, and would like to see it in the people around me. So, I’m mostly looking for people who identify—at least partially—with the description above and would enjoy the same activities. I believe in growth and potential; so I embrace people who are not there yet (so am I) but have, deep inside, the intention to reach it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as you fit some of the description, relationships, to me, transcend gender, age, culture, financial situation, or any other socio-demographic factors; please reach out to me regardless of your situation if you relate to my personality traits. Locations should not be an issue either (a priori); I’ve had close long-distance friendships which worked beautifully for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to form a close friendship with 3-5 people, and one life partnership with a woman. If you want a shallower connection, that’s also okay; maybe we can still contribute to each other’s lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile some key relationship values, such as depth and trust, grow over time, there is one value which, I believe, should be there from the start: honesty. In this regard, please be honest about your intentions—which may include different types of relationships depending on how it evolves, and that’s okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimers\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document desperately lacks elaboration, emotions, and personal information for privacy reasons. I have no issue sharing about my life story, what I look like, what I feel and think, vulnerability, intimacy, and other personal features in private."

      "fullText": "﻿Last updated Aug 25 2025  \r\nDemographics: male, 25 (born 1999), hetero, SF, work in tech. (boring!) \r\n\r\n\r\nFun facts and unsubtle flexes\r\n* I like to run barefoot. If you see me in GGP give me a high five! \r\n* I love foraging for wild plants. In college I was frequently caught eating wild greens growing outside the lecture halls. \r\n* I’m obsessed with Astral Codex Ten (see my favorite authors).\r\n* I occasionally write on Substack, though I don’t claim it’s any good (favorite post here).\r\n* I’m vegetarian – I recently ended four years of veganism :( \r\n* I meditate a fair amount - I’ve done two ten-day silent retreats. Occasionally I faint while doing breathwork. \r\n* I have four sisters :) \r\n* I love teaching - in college I TAed five different classes and was a frosh RA. \r\n* My first job was trading bonds at Jane Street and my current one is working at an AI startup. I am prone to nerding out about math, AI, and finance.\r\n* I occasionally freedive - I’ve been down 80 feet and held my breath for four minutes. \r\n* I’m a certified yoga instructor and want to start teaching in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship values\r\nHigh trust: I will assume that you mean well, are telling the truth, and have my best interests at heart until I see overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I have no interest in keeping score on who pays the most or does the most chores or emotional labor.[1]\r\nDirectness: If you’re weighing whether to be polite or to be frank, I usually prefer the latter. You can tell me an outfit is ugly even if I didn’t ask. We all want to be both kind and honest all the time, but I’m not smooth enough to achieve that. I will be forthcoming, occasionally at the expense of tact. \r\nHonesty: I’m disciplined about never lying or deceiving, even when I really want to to save someone’s feelings. I hope you’ll do the same. \r\nIndependence: I am charismatic and extrovert-presenting, but by nature am an introvert and value my alone time. If me going off the grid for ten days for a meditation retreat once every year or two would be extremely burdensome for you, we might not be a great match.[2] \r\n\r\n\r\nThings I’m attracted to (I think these all describe me too, maybe that makes me narcissistic oops)\r\nEccentricity, Confidence: Most people think you’re weird or wrong about topics you’ve thought hard about. You occasionally stick out in crowds and happily fail as you try new things. \r\nEmbodiment: You dance, meditate, sing, smell plants you pass on the street, jump in cold bodies of water, close your eyes to eat, enjoy physical touch\r\nIntelligence: You understand things intuitively across domains. I learn new things from you.\r\nAltruism: You treat strangers as friends as yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential dealbreakers\r\nPolitics: Hard to pin down, but words I occasionally identify with are liberal, rationalist, libertarian. I don’t care what your politics are, but I certainly care that you have intelligent opinions and are fun to talk to. \r\nKids: I’m 95% sure I want kids, open to biological or adopting, and would be pretty excited about having them sooner rather than later (looking at you, women a couple years older than me!) \r\nPolyamory: I’ve never been in a polyamorous relationship and I’m excited to try one, but if you’re monogamous that’s also great. I can’t bring myself to be jealous, and so won’t care if you’re dating other people or exploring feelings for another person while we’re together. I will encourage and support you in whatever endeavours bring you joy! But I can’t imagine being in one committed relationship and feeling like I have time and energy for another. If you’re monogamous, all I ask is that you trust me to set boundaries with other women and tell you my honest feelings. \r\nReligion: I’m not religious, but it’s fine if you are. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn a first date we could:\r\n* Have a picnic on the beach\r\n* Go for a hike or jog\r\n* Assign one another a favorite essay to read and discuss \r\n* Have a home-cooked meal at one of our apartments\r\n* Play laser tag \r\n* Bring friends on a double-date\r\n\r\n\r\nContact info: (650) 474 9283. robbiethompson2018@gmail.com. No socials. Bonus points if you reach out with a date me doc of your own! Some pics I use on the apps\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] Trust is earned by, eg, paying for things and doing emotional labor - I am excited to do these things! The important bit is to treat every interaction like a gift and not a transaction, and only take score when you have a very strong reason to believe you’re being taken advantage of. \r\n[2] To be explicit: I want an intimate and securely attached relationship, and I’m excited to support my pattern when they need it. But I am attracted to people who can be whole and happy in the absence of a romantic partner."

      "fullText": "﻿Manuel 08-2025\r\n________________\r\nBio\r\nI love deep conversations and unwinding with a book or a cup of coffee. I’m drawn to people who are smart, ambitious, and kind — not just in words, but in action. Honesty and straightforwardness mean everything to me, and I try to live by the same values. \r\nI’m monogamous and looking for a relationship that can grow into marriage. I’m attracted to women, but I don’t get caught up in narrow boxes of gender expression. My long-term goals are to earn a PhD, keep building my career in research and security policy, and create a home where love and laughter matter just as much as achievement. I’m open to children, whether by birth or adoption, and I can imagine either a rooted, settled life or a more nomadic, international one. What matters most is partnership: choosing and building together. \r\nFamily matters to me. My mother is a central part of my life, and I believe in gratefulness—if your parents are good people, it’s important to nurture that relationship. \r\nMy roots stretch across the Americas. My grandfather moved around the continent with the American Telegraph Company, my mom volunteered in Nicaragua during the time of the Contras, and I first went to Guatemala when I was 13 — the civil war stories I heard there shaped why I went into security studies. I’m Mexican by birth, with Middle Eastern family history, so contradictions and cultural layers have always been part of my life.\r\nGrowing up, I spent 12 years in the Scouts and trained in martial arts. It gave me a love for teamwork, resilience, and the outdoors. Those lessons shaped me just as much as my professional path. I grew up in Waldorf and used to romanticize that world, though over time my tastes have shifted. I published my first poem in an anthology when I was 16.         I love the history of ideas, aesthetics and political economy. \r\nEA-wise, between 2021 and 2023, I worked informally with the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative (SERI). That experience culminated in a small post “Foundations for a Longtermist Foreign Policy.” In it, I argued for deeper collaboration between the effective altruism and defense communities, challenging narrow AI risk framings and emphasizing actionable, implementable solutions. Since then, I’ve focused on the intersection of military capabilities, doctrine, and venture capital — not from a technical angle, but through strategic analysis.\r\nI love good food (fresh from the market). At my core, I’m principled but pragmatic, mixing seriousness with humor and idealism with realism.  I want a genuine connection with someone curious, ambitious, and kind — someone who can challenge me with ideas, and also remind me to laugh and enjoy the lighter side of life.\r\nig:mthe_turbantghost\r\nBasic Info\r\n* Name: Manuel\r\n\r\n* Age: 24\r\n* MBTI: ENTP\r\n* Height: 178 cm\r\n\r\n* Languages: Spanish, English\r\n\r\n* Location: Small town in the middle of nowhere, Mexico\r\n\r\n* From: San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. \r\n\r\n* Lives in: Palo Alto, CA (If the DHS would let me in.

A life partner, eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friends say I’m: enthusiastic, funny, perceptive, and affectionate.\r\n\r\n\r\nValues I’d like us to share: optimism, playfulness, creativity, intellectual curiosity, openness, altruism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork: I'm chief of staff to GiveWell's research director—we help people in need as much as we can. Previously I was a high school math teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nFun:\r\n* Climbing/staying fit: I climb ~every day and I’m always looking for more partners. I also bike to work nearly every day, run, lift, and generally stay very active. Lmk if you want to join the regular weekend hike that I organize!\r\n* Chatting with friends: I like to have long walks and dinners with close friends, to talk about our lives, our thoughts, our feelings, and everything under the sun.\r\n* Writing: I have umpteen blog drafts with titles like “How to listen better” and “How much do we really know about apples?” Occasionally I post them on my Substack, but tbh I get more joy from arguing about drafts with my friends than from posting final versions.\r\n* Music: I play piano and sing. Playing music for/with people is one of my favorite things in life — I go to jams as much as possible, and I stop by a public piano on my way home from work many evenings. I’m big into neo-soul and R&B right now; listening to Son Little on loop.\r\n* Reading: My in-progress reads are A Desolation Called Peace, John Stuart Mill's autobiography, Anton Chekhov’s short stories, and this essay. Several all-time favorites are Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, Tolstoy’s The Kingdom of God is Within You, and the epic Terra Ignota series.\r\n* Making stuff and trying new things: This year I've experimented with making kombucha and ice cream, plus vibe-coding several small apps.\r\n* Games: Some of my recent faves are spikeball, capture the flag, Lost Cities, Res Arcana, and Coup.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential dealbreakers:\r\n* I’ll probably be in the SF Bay until early 2027, then in DC. I'm happy to try out long distance for a 🔥 connection, and it’s easy for me to travel because I can work remotely.\r\n* I don't have strong feelings on many things that might be dealbreakers to others. If you’re concerned about dealbreakers I haven’t mentioned, err on the side of reaching out!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we have potential, Gmail me at calumbest1 — just say “saw your date-me doc” and tell me your name; I can handle the rest. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know me in real life, I won’t think it's awkward if you reach out, seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d also be interested in feedback on this doc 👀 is it good or does it suck?"

      "fullText": "Erik's Date Me Doc | Erik Lönnroth's blog\nErik Lönnroth's blog\nAbout\nBlog\nProjects\n# Hello!\nMy name is Erik Lönnroth, and I am looking to meet the love of my life. I’ve written this doc to help you decide whether I'm someone worth getting to know. I’ve tried to be as honest about my shortcomings as I am about my strengths.\n💁‍♂️ About me\nI’m 39 years old, 175cm (5'9) and fortunate to be in excellent health. I’m from Sweden but live in Cape Town and currently work remotely for a strategy consulting firm based in London. I triangulate between these three locations in order to maintain my career, friendships, and family ties. I’m fluent in Swedish, English and French, and can get by in a handful of other human and computer languages.\nAs much as I love Cape Town for its stunning nature and colourful characters, I would consider relocating for the right person.\nI don’t have any kids, but hope to one day get married and start a family. If you have kids, that’s perfectly fine, as long as you’re open to having a few more.\n🔎 How I view things\nIf I have a superpower, it’s my ability to observe a situation from multiple perspectives. I look for the grain of truth in each point of view, rather than rejecting any as wholly wrong or bad. I then seek to find a way forward by integrating the nuggets of wisdom from each perspective into a coherent whole. Sometimes this process can make me slow at decision making. But once I’ve decided, I don’t tend to look back. To balance out my analytical tendencies, I appreciate having a partner with a well honed intuition. Someone who can say “this feels right” and trust her gut. Importantly though, she needs to be good at reasoning from first principles so we can resolve disagreements respectfully.\n🛶 Marriage is a vessel\nAlthough I wouldn’t describe myself as conventionally religious, spirituality is the foundation of my life. I maintain a daily meditation practice that has taken years to cultivate, but I’ve finally found the key to consistency. Once or twice a year I attend Zen retreats in Europe or the US. These periods of intense practice have frequently sparked profound awakenings for me, leading to greater clarity, connectedness, and wisdom.\nI would like my partner to walk the spiritual path with me, not as my student or teacher, but as my equal. Your practice doesn’t necessarily have to be sitting meditation; it could be yoga, breathwork, prayer, embodiment practices, or anything else that opens your heart and mind. What matters is that you approach it with utmost dedication and deep curiosity. Ultimately, I view marriage as a vessel for two individuals to experience the Divine through Love, and I want my wife to share this vision for our relationship. That doesn’t mean that everything we talk about has to be imbued with the language of sacredness — 99% of the time it won’t — only that we have a shared understanding of our deepest purpose on this planet: to help each other awaken. Whether you believe in God or not matters less to me than your capacity to take on each day recognising the precious gift that it is to simply be alive! My greatest fear is finding myself on my deathbed facing the bitter realisation that I held back out of fear, never daring to love fully.\n🤓 Live to learn\nI’ve dedicated my career to building innovative approaches to learning, mostly in Africa, where educational institutions are currently failing half a billion children. Over the years I’ve launched literacy interventions in Kenya, developed tablet-based teaching solutions in Zambia, and run an online mathematics tutoring startup in South Africa. At times a Quixotic mission, it has nevertheless been immensely fascinating and fulfilling.\nI have an insatiable curiosity about people and things. I subscribe to a wide array of newspapers, blogs, and podcasts on everything from finance and technology to psychology and history. Admittedly, this sometimes feels like drinking out of a firehose, and I’m increasingly wondering whether I might in fact be better off on a minimal information diet. If we end up dating, one of the ways you can help me stay present is to keep reminding me to put my phone/laptop away. Preferably in another room.\n🌍 Pole to pole\nI don’t think it’s a coincidence that as someone who constantly seeks to integrate different perspectives, I divide my time between northern Europe and southern Africa. Africa is vivid, colourful, crazy, and often dysfunctional — it unlocks my adventurous spirit while allowing me to appreciate the things we take for granted in the developed world. Europe, on the other hand, offers me career opportunities, family ties, and cultural belonging. As much as I would love to continue having one foot in each continent, I’m also prepared to give that up and commit to one location for the sake of marriage, if my partner is unable to follow my migratory patterns.\n🐺 Into the wild\nI love being active and staying in shape. I’m training for an ultra trail race later this year, which requires a lot of running and functional fitness. I’m generally a fan of anything to do with mountains and the sea, such as hiking, climbing, skiing, sailing, and surfing.\nAt least once a year I like to go on a proper adventure, camping out in some remote wilderness far from civilisation, swallowed up by the silence of mountains and the twinkling of stars. Though I occasionally crave the restorative benefits of escaping off-grid all on my own, most of the time I want to bring my woman along to experience the majesty. Hopefully you’re the kind of lady who loves the outdoors and doesn’t mind a little dirt under her finger nails.\n🫃Let’s make a food baby!\nWhen it comes to sustenance, I’m a discerning omnivore. I enjoy cooking and I love trying out new restaurants. On a Sunday morning, I’ll walk the extra mile for specialist coffee or an artisanal bakery. However, as much as I love the finer things in life, I’m also happy to have a relaxing evening and order takeaway (but please read the most recent reviews, just to be sure!).\nI drink alcohol in moderation, and often go dry for weeks at a time. I don’t smoke or take drugs. I’d like to keep my mental and physical faculties sharp for many decades to come, and if we’re to grow old together, it’s important to me that you also look after your body and mind.\n🪘Music fuels the soul\nMy friends and I often get together and host impromptu musical jam sessions. We play, sing, dance, chat, and party like this most weekends. It’s a blast and one of the most amazing ways of kicking off steam. Sometimes our jams attract more than 30 people — all levels welcome! The friendships forged over the years at these gatherings have led me to various spinoff hobbies and pursuits, including freediving, motorcycle trips, and launching a business.\n☯️ The best and worst of me\nIntegrity, intellect, calm, discipline, kindness, generosity, adventure. These are the qualities I have to offer. But you’re likely to also encounter judgment, doubt, and withdrawal. That is how I'll react when you let me down. I experience disappointment viscerally, and my instinct is to pull away, creating distance. Softening into faith and forgiveness instead of descending into doubt — that’s The Work for me. But the silver lining is this: as much as I can dish out the tough love, I’m also good at receiving it without defensiveness or deflection. You can be radically honest with me, and I will listen attentively, seek to understand your perspective, and appreciate you for having the courage to speak your mind.\n🧲 What attracts me\nI'm turned on by women who are fully, unapologetically themselves. Those who have the courage to drop carefully maintained facades in favour of a disarming realness. Those who, while working to be more loving and compassionate, also honour and acknowledge their Shadow. I want to know both the saint and the sinner within. A woman who shows up fully is willing to challenge taboos, confess her deepest desires to her partner, and expand emotional and intimate boundaries. By maintaining a non-judgmental space where no topic or question is off limits we allow our lover to open the kimono all the way - physically, psychologically and spiritually.\nA marriage will lose its spark unless we find ways of continuously surprising each other and ourselves. The juicy bits are hiding in the shadows, and it is our sacred practice to bring those aspects into the light and own them.\n💚 Green flags\nI don’t expect you to tick all of these, but they’ll give you an idea of the qualities that would make\nme\njump in with both feet.\nSpeaks from the heart\nKeeps promises, big and small\nNot too concerned with what others think\nCultured and deeply curious about the world\nEloquent writer and/or speaker — it correlates with being a good thinker\nHas the courage and determination to do hard things, like completing a PhD, growing a business, publishing a novel, or being a competitive athlete\nAcknowledges her trauma without making it into an identity\nMaintains fun-loving, kind, ambitious friends\nHas her financial life in order, though I recognise that sometimes life deals us lemons\nDecent dancer (I love to shake ma booty!)\nOver to you\nIf you found your way to this page through some algorithm and don’t have my contact details, you can send me an\nemail\n. I will respond to every message. If I’m not your cup of tea, but you have a cute friend you think might be into me, feel free to share this page with her.\nThank you for reading!\nPowered by\nBear\nʕ•ᴥ•ʔ"

Although this page may suggest otherwise, I’m not super tech bro-y. I spend a good amount of time in front of screens, yet I’m quite technologically challenged. This is a running doc on my personality as well as what I’m looking for in a partner.\nPreface:\nI don’t have a laundry list of filters. I’m not perfect, and I don’t expect my partner to be either. Importantly, I don’t look for finished products.\nA little about me\nIndia, 1998. Born to Hindi, forced to English. To echo words of\nNaval Ravikant\n, I have a calm mind, am working toward a fit body, and am looking for a house full of love. Strictly monogamous. Have an older sister. Parents back in India.\nI’ve moved a lot since covid, almost too much to the point that it’s exhausting to even think about packing suitcases. Grateful for all experiences. I’ve spent my formative years outside India and have been away from home for 12 years. I’m currently a software engineer.\nI’m not a transactional person. It irks me when people give depending on what they’ve received in the past, in any relationship, not just romantic ones. I keep my friend circle small, and I’m happy to do things by myself - I don’t want superficial connections. I am routinely alone, and I’m generally secure about this, although I have some off days too.\nI don’t like labels because I believe everyone’s on some sort of spectrum. I don’t know my MBTI, but I am more on the introverted side. It takes me a bit to open up and be vulnerable. I am obviously batshit crazy and act possessed around people I trust.\nI grew up as a vegetarian. In meats, I only eat chicken (and sometimes salmon). I don’t care if you eat/cook whatever, but of course it would be lovely to be able to share most of our meals. I also love cooking for others when I’m in the mood.\nHomebody at heart but try my best to not miss a sunny day. Like to try any and all sports.\nNorth star:\nI want to be proud of myself when I’m 80. Actively working on being more present. At any given moment, I’m usually chipping away at my doc on life goals. Mostly just vibing though.\nWhat I’m looking for\nSomeone who hyperfixates on the positives. Spending years together is not going to be easy if we can’t look past the trivial/unimportant. I default to seeing the good in people way before their flaws, and I’d like to be with someone who leans the same way.\nPatience. One of my favorite quotes from A Gentleman in Moscow:\nBy their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration – and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.\nIn for the long haul and I’m happy to take things slowly. That said, patience also doesn’t mean bottling up feelings until a vague notion of “enough time” has passed. If I like you, I’ll try my best to communicate it.\nNon-judgemental. My best friendships are with people who are kind in their hearts and deeply care about understanding each other.\nA partnership full of growth. Someone who supports the other person thru the ups and downs, someone soft and candid. We laugh easily and tease each other. Good chemistry and intimacy. No topic is off the table and no walking on egg shells.\nIf\nyou’re Indian, I’d love to be able to speak Hindi with you, although it’s not a must-have. I am also typically more attracted to Indians who grew up in India - easier to connect.\nA beautiful smile.\nWhat I don’t want 🚩\nIf you play games (think tiktoks on loyalty tests etc). No time for those. If I can avoid it, I don’t want anyone to have to second-guess what I’m thinking or wait ages for a response from me.\nIf you treat me like an option, I’m out. I naturally focus on one person at a time, even early on. It’s ok if you aren’t the same (you’re a queen - I’m sure you have options), but after a few dates, I expect honesty about whether you see something here. Please don’t keep me around as a backup - be kind.\nA political activist. I don’t want to talk politics day in day out. To me, politics is mentally and emotional draining with no clear benefit.\nDrugs or substance addiction. I drink occasionally and I don’t smoke. I strongly prefer non-smokers, but I’m ok as long as you don’t stink and are healthy.\n-\nIf you made it this far, thank you :) Again, anything mentioned above is a nice-to-have. I am hopelessly optimistic in people, for better or for worse. I know it can be scary to reach out, but I promise I’ll be nice to you. Please email me at\nyashmittal2009 [at] gmail [dot] com\n.\nWords of\nYash Mittal"

      "fullText": "﻿I’m a 30 year old, straight, cis male, and live in Sheffield, UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m blonde, medium build, and very tall (6”7) - for snuggling, more of a ladle than a big spoon. \r\n\r\n\r\nI work remotely as a software developer.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities I value: kindness, curiosity, empathy, honesty, intelligence, consistency, fun-seeking, being slow to judge, tolerance/enjoyment of weirdness, being able to consider that you could be wrong. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m fairly quiet, introverted and slightly shy, empathetic and good at listening to others. I'm gentle, often uncertain and indecisive and sometimes stumble over my words. I like being around people who are reasonably talkative and energetic, as I find myself being more talkative and energetic with them, which I like.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy worldview is firmly rationalist, scientific materialist. I don't think i could date someone who believes in the supernatural. I do however go to my local Buddhist temple and try to meditate regularly. The philosophy of love and kindness to all beings, and using awareness and mindfulness to reduce suffering resonantes with me. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also vegan, center- left politically,a loose member of the Effective Altruism movement and donate around 10% of my salary to effective charities working to bring people out of extreme poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to be able to talk about ‘deep’ stuff with a partner. That might be your worldviews, the things you value, memories, things you're proud of, secrets, embarrassing stories.  I'm not very dogmatic in my views and want to be able to disagree with a partner and still be able to respect each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of my hobbies at the moment revolve around bikes. My holidays often involve long cycling trips through europe. I'd love someone to join me on these adventures, and for camping, wild swimming and hiking. \r\n\r\n\r\nI sometimes take illegal drugs, generally lsd, mdma or magic mushrooms, so you'd have to be OK with this and ideally up for joining me on trips.\r\n\r\n\r\nI currently think there's a 60% probability I won't ever want kids, and 75% I won't want them in the next 10 years. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a solid long term monogamous or primary relationship with someone I'm crazy about, but I'm quite up for making friends and flings along the way. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcentration face\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have to duck under things a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThat time i ascended into heaven"

      "fullText": "Date quinn | Quinn Dougherty\nSkip to main content\nQuinn Dougherty\nCV\nDate me\nemail\nDemographic\n33 years old, male, polyamorous\nSeeking\nWoman: romance, spouse, housemate, cofounder for childrearing projects.\nAlso seeking\nWomen: romance\nBig five\nSelf administered, summer 2022\n.\nIn Berkeley CA\nUnclear where to raise kids, though, and willing to travel a bunch for the first few months of dating a serious primary/coparent candidate.\nTestimonial by my dear friend Gavriel\n​\nWhat I most admire about Quinn is how much he cares and how much he’s willing to put action into his caring. He genuinely wants to be there for other people. I’ve seen him show so much openness to emotional connection in times when even other resilient and emotionally mature people would have been inclined to take a step back from their existing relationships. I’ve never seen stonewalling or apathy from him. Quinn always cares, and is excited to show that he cares. If you have the same love languages as Quinn, he’ll be able to make you feel super special. Being there for other people and caring doesn’t just mean caring about his friends or partners—he also shows up for communities. At a party, he’s either the host or the guy you assume is the host because he introduces a new burst of energy to each room he’s in.\nQuinn also has a super strong sense of self; he won’t passively fall into trends. I’ve never heard him be insincere or mocking. When so much media and so many conversations contain at least a little bit, and sometimes a lot, of mockery, Quinn has a refreshingly firm focus on topics where he can be completely sincere. Basically, it feels like the idiom “big-hearted” was invented to describe Quinn.\nTraits to make me swoon\n​\nSincerity\n: Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness.\nAnalyticalness\n: My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that.\nConviction\n: Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean\nloyalty\nto convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments.\nCompassion\n: I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others.\nAmbition\n: I want to be with goal-directed people.\nIntrospectiveness\n: There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up.\nType of guy (containing exactly one lie)\n​\nAn ex once reported that I'm \"really gung ho about the mortifying ordeal of being known\".\nI've been known to run taco nights at my house.\nSwam from alcatraz to SF.\nReally psyched about work, generally enjoy being someone who works a lot.\nAsk me about my subsubfield of preventing AI from causing my death.\nAlmost entirely vegetarian.\nBaby fever, but don't do a lot of thinking about my parenting values because I'd rather do that thinking as a group project with a special someone.\nOften singing and humming, hopefully a turning a loved one's name into song.\nI have at least two mysterious backstories.\nYes the kidney tshirt is real.\nOne secret zest for life / high hedonic setpoint trait/behavior that it'd be more fun to surprise you with.\nFic/media: mostly scifi and fantasy. Music: metal, prog, jazz.\nI'm getting turbo back into Wagner, currently mapping out the Arthurian sources (starting with Troyes) so I can better understand Parsifal/Lohengrin and to a lesser extent Tristan/Isolde.\nSome freaky kinks but not an outrageously high libido.\nIncome and net worth each low six figures, no debt. I\nroughly\nthink embryo selection is more important than buying a house, but open to discussion.\nI'd like to take the Giving What We Can 10% pledge at some point over the next few years.\nAtheist\nReach out\n​\nEmail:\nquinn.dougherty.forall@gmail.com\nWould love to pivot to signal > sms > element/matrix > telegram > some mutual slack we happen to both be in after a brief exchange.\nOpeners / conversation menu\n​\nHow's your master plan going?\nAffection styles / love languages\nYour (least?) favorite failure mode of \"Radical Honesty\" -adjacent practices\nHow erotic is assembling furniture together, scale of 1-10\nHow you think about the poly vs monog question\nOne of your \"strong view weakly held\" current childrearing beliefs/strats that you want my help to double check as a research project.\nTestimonial by my dear friend Gavriel\nTraits to make me swoon\nType of guy (containing exactly one lie)\nReach out\nOpeners / conversation menu\nSocials\nCan we secure AI via formal methods?\nLessWrong\nEffective Altruism Forum\nGitHub\nX\nManifold\nSite built at Fri Oct 31 2025 14:05:41 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)."

Looking to build meaningful connections for polyamorous dating and community. Magnetic, warm, curious, playful, witty, and grounded.\nUsually wearing a smile.\nAbout me\nBasics\nAge: 36\nGender: Male\nLocation: San Francisco, CA\nHeight: 5’9”\nRelationship style: Polyamory/ENM\nOrientation: Bisexual\nWants kids: 85% no, has had a vasectomy\nClick here to contact me\nSummary\nI’m extroverted, energetic, and deeply curious—drawn to new ideas, intense conversations, and novel experiences. I believe you can decide what you want in life and take steps to create it.\nFor example, I once quit my job as an engineer, dropped out of a PhD, and bought a one-way ticket to Southeast Asia to build a business. Since then, I’ve settled in San Francisco and split my time between work, hobbies, and growing in weirdly wonderful communities.\nPeople tell me I’m someone they can call in a crisis. I stay grounded when things get messy and genuinely like helping others. If you care about personality types: I’m an ESTP, Enneagram 7w8, and Neutral Good.\nThanks for taking a look at my Date Me Doc. If you read this and feel a spark of curiosity, let’s talk!\nRelationships\nI’ve been in the ENM and kink scene since 2016. I am polyamorous and prefer kitchen table poly, where everyone can hang out together as they feel comfortable. I am currently dating a few people very casually.\nI’m looking for both primary and non-primary connections, where we can both be vulnerable, explore together, and collaborate on creating something unique between us. I love that every relationship brings something special to the table, and I don’t expect one person to meet every need.\nI have hesitations about dating someone who is brand new to polyamory and prefer that you have your own experiences to bring to the table, but I’m open to discussing this.\nKink\nI’m active in the Bay Area kink scene and regularly attend sex parties within my communities.\nI prefer partners with at least a baseline familiarity with kink or BDSM due to the level of communication it requires. I identify as a Dominant and connect best with partners who are submissive or switchy.\nHappy to talk more about this in person together.\nSomewhere in Sedona, AZ.\nFamily, Community, and Kids\nI grew up in rural South Carolina in a small family: parents and a brother who is 8 years older than me. I’m close with my parents and talk to them a few times a week. Despite growing up in SC, the Bay Area is my home. Any future moves would be to a similar or larger city.\nI’ve been in the Bay since 2021 and was lucky to find and grow with several amazing communities. In a group, I can equally enjoy being the person who inspires everyone into action or the one who quietly drives the car while everyone sleeps on a road trip.\nI’ve had a vasectomy and I am 85% certain I don’t want kids. I’d consider it under really unique circumstances, but if having kids is a core priority for you, I am probably not the right partner.\nTrying to keep my dad out of trouble while he tells the same joke to everyone in the grocery store.\nLifestyle, career, and hobbies\nI try to strike a balance between movement and rest (though I’m often not great at rest).\nWhen I’m active, I enjoy walking through the city, snowboarding, lifting weights, or training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. When I’m resting, I enjoy reading a Spanish novel in the park, journaling, creating music, or relaxing with friends.\nCareer-wise, I’ve built a really unusual path and enjoy aiming at something difficult or risky and finding ways to make it into a reality. I identify less with any one job and more with the idea that: hard work = way more options in life.\nI grew up playing guitar/bass in bands since age 16 and was once a professional touring musician. These days, I mostly lend my skills to campfires or house parties when requested. A few times a year, I get together with friends from across the country to go to electronic music festivals. If you have any interest, we’d love to have new people join us!\nYou can probably assume I haven’t seen a show or movie. I’ve got a few gems up my sleeve, and I’ll absolutely show up for your favorites—but I’ve been out of the loop since Game of Thrones ended.\nFind me just about anywhere: the city, the mountains, or the sea.\nAbout you\nWe might be a good fit if… (not all required)\nYou live in (or frequent) the Bay Area and are in the 25–45 range\nYou are non-monogamous and ideally have some experience with kink\nYou lean towards being warm, curious, and enjoy physical touch\nYou try to communicate well: express emotions, set boundaries, and handle conflict with care\nYou ski or snowboard\nYou lean towards being more of a morning person\nYou care deeply about something—your work, your hobbies, your community, etc\nYou try to take care of your body and mind in ways that feel good to you\nYou can be serious and silly\nSkydiving on my birthday, 10/10 would do again.\nTogether we could…\nBreak a sweat: hiking, a workout class, pilates, skiing, etc.\nBuild a playlist for our first road trip\nDiscuss the meaning of life or how to achieve world peace using memes\nSee who can make the other cry laughing first\nDance at a concert, then debrief over food and people-watching\nWander into an art gallery and pretend to be famous art critics\nSleep in, drink French press coffee, then compare our bucket list items\nCo-work across from each other and take strategic cuddle breaks\nLet’s volunteer together!\nThings that don’t work for me\nA monogamous relationship\nA communication style that takes several days to respond\nConsistently breaking plans without explanation\nYou’re deeply religious and want me to share in that\nConstantly avoiding hard or awkward conversations\nWhat’s it like to date me?\nHow I show up in relationships\nI’m a direct communicator who loves to learn and grow with others. I believe the best relationships are built intentionally–without shying away from hard conversations. I prefer regular check-ins so we can work through something early rather than let friction or resentment build in silence.\n💡\nFun facts: I run warm (great if you get cold), sleep like a rock, and have a strong grip for massages.\nI want to understand how you see the world or at least what you’re passionate about. I want us to co-create a relationship where we both feel chosen over and over again, and the cornerstone of our relationship will ideally be a strong friendship.\nIn addition, I value the fact that we both have our own lives. Whether we see each other all the time or once a month, you’ll have my full attention when we’re together.\nIt’s officially wedding and +1 season\nLove languages and romance\nThe ways I prefer to show and receive affection are very similar. I enjoy quality time, physical touch, and a steady stream of witty banter (plus the occasional bite). I love hyping up my partner and listening to your thoughts about the world.\nI’m not very big on traditional romantic gestures: giving or receiving fancy gifts, rose petals in a candlelit room, etc., but I’m working to broaden my horizons. For me, romance is about being intentional—learning what lights each other up and making sure we feel it.\nSocial settings\nYou should bring me as a +1 to your next event—I can blend in with friends, family, or coworkers and talk to anyone. I love getting into spontaneous conversations and seeing where we end up. You might think that’s from a decade of working in sales, but my parents will confirm that I’ve been a social butterfly since I was 6.\nI’m happy to stick by your side or let you do your thing while I explore the room. I don’t get separation anxiety. As long as we connect at some point, I’m good.\n🤝\nIf you get stuck in an awkward convo, I’m great at swooping in with a joke or a smooth exit.\nI am also aware that sometimes I can have too much energy for the situation. Just let me know and I am happy to regulate for the occasion.\nI don’t expect you to be big into sports, but they’re a great excuse to hang with (or make new) friends.\nHow I handle conflict and feedback\nI see conflict as an opportunity for growth, not a fight. We’re on the same team, trying to understand each other and figure out what needs to be seen. When things get tense, I stay calm and grounded so we can figure it out together.\nI don’t raise my voice during an argument. I’m not a stoic robot, but there are ways to express yourself while being respectful. I take feedback seriously, especially when it comes from a place of care. I want us to both feel comfortable sharing ways to grow.\nNaturally, I don’t weigh negative interactions as heavily as others might, so I won’t let a single bad moment define a person or a relationship. I default to assuming good intent and look at the whole picture rather than over-indexing on one issue.\nWhat are other people saying about me?\n❤️\n“Jarrett is magnetic, driven, and deeply curious! Someone who’s always reaching for more in life and invites you to do the same. Great fit for people who are ambitious, self-aware, and excited by growth and new experiences.\nIf you’re someone who coasts without much internal drive or avoids introspection, you’ll probably feel left behind. But if you love playful depth, thoughtful conversation, and someone who’s as invested in his own evolution as he is in yours, he’s an incredible person to share time with.”\n- Former primary partner\n⭐\n“Jarrett is like a golden retriever trapped in a man’s body. He is smart, kind, and gives slightly sadistic massages. If you’re kinky and/or a size queen, he’s got you covered. His worst feature is his insistence on living in SF instead of in Berkeley, but hey, nobody’s perfect.\nHe has multiple communities of friends, active hobbies, and also a great career. He has proven capable of excellent banter and custom memes. So many green flags!”\n- Regular play partner and friend\nMore reviews to come soon!\nLet’s get in touch\nIf you’ve read this far and are still curious, I’d love to hear from you.\nContact me by filling out this Google Form here."

So instead of a five word Tinder profile I’ve created this massive Google doc because I think it makes sense to just be frank and give people the information upfront. But hey, “Don’t laugh, it works”.    \r\n\r\n\r\nKey things:\r\n* I lean poly. I definitely open to casual dating and hookups, but I’m most interested in a long-term relationship where we mainly invest in that relationship. With a good match I could also consider monogamy. Something intermediate could also be good, like an open relationship. \r\n* I’m location flexible. I’m currently based in London, England, but also spend a significant amount of time in Vancouver, Canada (my hometown). I would consider long distance and potentially moving for the right person.\r\n* I’m open to a lot of different different things with partners (long-term, short-term, FWB, hookups, etc.). Ultimately, I feel ready for a serious relationship and that’s what I am most interested in, but I’m not desperate for one, and ready to explore and see where things lead. Since I’m poly, I’m also always going to be interested in other stuff as well\r\n* You can reach me at https://www.facebook.com/Max.Carpendale/ or maxcarpendale@Gmail.com\r\n* I’m cis and straight(ish)\r\n* I’m 34\r\n   \r\nAbout me:\r\nI have an odd combination of more macho/hardcore/adventurous interests and presentation with anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity. So if you’re looking for someone who looks tough, is strong and is into doing ambitious, daring stuff, but is a softy and sensitive, I’m your dude.\r\nI’m very ambitious throughout my life, though that certainly veers into perfectionism at times. In my career I do research for an animal advocacy org that provides research support to other organizations and tries to make them more effective. I’m very passionate about reducing suffering through my career. I’ve been vegan for ages and before that I was vegetarian for almost my whole life. I’ve been reading rationalist blogs for 18 years and I have been in the Effective Altruism movement for 14 years.\r\nI’m very sporty and really enjoy strength training, calisthenics, cycling, hiking, swimming, and bouldering. Strength training and other work on my body helps me (functionally) recover from chronic pain, so it’s a big deal for me. I also generally put a lot of effort into my health with things like healthy eating, massage, meditation, and sauna.\r\n   \r\nOther things I’m into:\r\n* Travel: always keen on exploring somewhere new, especially new countries\r\n* Metal (especially folk, black, death and doom), but you can probably tell that by looking at me 😉 and other music including folk, synthwave, punk, and postpunk. I generally like music on the experimental end of things\r\n* Horror movies/short stories (especially folk horror)\r\n* Geography/geopolitics\r\n* Philosophy (especially ethics and philosophy of mind)\r\n* Learning as much as I can about as much as I can (I listen to mostly nonfiction audiobooks any spare moment I get)\r\n* Gratitude: to appreciate this fleeting gift of life\r\n* Rationality: facing up to what’s true\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat do I offer?\r\n* I very rarely get angry in relationships or blame other people for things\r\n* I try to practice something like nonviolent communication\r\n* I can be very understanding and accommodating of mental and physical health difficulties (having had some it’s very easy to access empathy)\r\n* I am very cuddly and affectionate (love language is mostly touch and words of affirmation)\r\n* I am capable of loving deeply\r\n* I am extremely committed to self-improvement\r\n* I really like comforting people when they’re feeling down\r\n* I work out a lot, so I am fairly muscular and will likely continue to get more muscular\r\n* I’m quite interested in fashion and try to dress well\r\n* I’m quite self-aware/conscious of my faults\r\n* I like to think that I have great taste in media/art, but see below\r\n* I love to give massages (and I’m generally good with my hands 😉)\r\n* I’m very GGG\r\n* I’m location flexible\r\n   \r\nDifficulties\r\n* I am quite neurotic, specifically I have struggled most of my life with anxiety and depression\r\n* I think I’m quite good at communication at this point, but it’s something that I’ve had to learn, so I don’t naturally show as much emotion as I would like\r\n* I sometimes have an insecure attachment, so I may ask for reassurance, and highly appreciate receiving it\r\n* Because of my perfectionism, I can be quite indecisive\r\n* I have a large amount of self-doubt\r\n* I’m quite eclectic in my taste in media, so it may be hard to find overlap with people (we may not \r\nTo summarize, I’m someone who needs more reassurance than most! Having said this, I’ve been spending a lot of time on mental health, and I’ve been improving at a lot of these. These things also help me be more open and understanding of suffering in others. They also contribute to me being super committed to self-examination and improvement.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat dating me is like:  \r\nDating preferences (none of these are requirements!):\r\n* I love dates in nature. A walk in the park sounds like a great first date\r\n* I also like the idea of crazier dates (wild swimming then sauna anyone?)\r\n* I also really like cozy environments for later dates, like dinner at one of ours\r\n* I really like the idea of doing trips and holidays with someone once we are in a relationship\r\n* My anxiety centers around speaking, so I’m not the most talkative, but I’m very physically affectionate\r\n* I enjoy drinking on dates, though it’s fine if you don’t\r\n* Taking psychedelics and such once we are in a relationship sounds wonderful to me\r\n* I really enjoy check-in texts and text to share moments with each other\r\n* I also really like calls\r\n* I really enjoy kink events and the odd sex party 😜\r\n* I like burner fests/other hippie events\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to be overly prescriptive (these aren’t strict requirements or expectations by any means), but some general things I’m looking for in a partner are:\r\n* Someone who is into effective altruism\r\n* Someone who is vegan/into animal advocacy\r\n* Someone with a curiosity and intellectual engagement with the world\r\n* Someone very emotional who can feel and love deeply\r\n*  Someone who look at practices open and honest communication\r\n* Someone drawn to the darker parts of the world and darker media (metal, horror, controversial ideas, the horrible parts of history, etc.)\r\n* Someone sporty or athletic who is interested in doing things like hikes, cycling, swimming\r\n* Someone who is very sexually driven/high libido and adventurous/experimental/kinky\r\n* Someone with an alternative/metalhead/goth aesthetic\r\n* Someone ambitious and career driven\r\n* Someone who is very into travel\r\n* Someone very affectionate/cuddly\r\nI would be surprised if anyone had all of these, so don’t let that stop you from reaching out!"

      "fullText": "﻿Tab 1\r\nAbout Me  \r\nHello, I’m Baram![1] I was born in 1995; I grew up in New England, mainly Massachusetts, also spending a few years in Israel when I was younger. I did my undergrad in math and CS at the University of Maryland, then got a PhD in mathematical neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh. I recently moved to Berkeley to work on AI safety research. I was raised a Modern Orthodox Jew; I’m now an atheist. I’m looking for a monogamous relationship and ultimately to raise a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Last updated 9/16/25)\r\nPersonality\r\n* Low extraversion, high conscientiousness, high-ish agreeableness, low-ish neuroticism, high openness\r\n* My MBTI is IXTJ, “X” because the test I took put me roughly in the middle of that axis (traits are normally distributed, who knew)\r\n Beliefs & Values\r\n* I generally value conscientiousness, integrity, learning, self-improvement, and working on something impactful.\r\n* Rationalist; I think the Sequences are great. I’m not sure I totally identify as an EA, but still I’m pretty aligned with them.\r\n* My diet is currently somewhere halfway between vegetarian and vegan.\r\n* My politics are generally liberal/libertarian-ish. I don’t have a problem with some political disagreement, but in practice, if you’re a Trump supporter or a leftist we’re probably just not going to get along very well.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies & Interests\r\n* Space, AI, tech, math, neuroscience, science in general\r\n* Classical music: I play piano (poorly) and write music (slightly less poorly).[2] I used to play violin (also poorly), but haven’t picked it up in a while. I almost exclusively listen to classical music (that one I think I’m pretty good at!).\r\n* Reading: mainly history and sci-fi, but occasionally science, philosophy, and other subjects.[3]\r\n* Camping, hiking, backpacking.\r\n* I picked up bouldering over the past few years, along with everyone else on the planet.\r\n* Board games, chess, DnD, MTG; which one I’m most engaged in tends to depend on my social scene.\r\n* I generally unwind by reading blogs,[4] watching youtube, or playing video games.\r\nLifestyle\r\n* I’m fairly neat.\r\n* I’m generally a homebody.\r\n* I tend to be open with people I know well, but very private otherwise: I generally dislike posting things online,[5] and use social media exclusively for individual or group chats.\r\n* I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs, although depending on the particulars it might be fine if you do.\r\n* While I like hiking and bouldering, I’m not really athletic, and don’t generally enjoy working out.\r\n* I have very minimal exposure to popular culture: I only listen to classical music, and I watch very few movies or TV shows.\r\n* I’m not really a foodie: I enjoy good food when I have it, but I don’t find it very motivating and don’t really go out of my way to get it.\r\n* I’ve traveled a bit and enjoyed myself, and I’m planning on travelling more soon, but in general it’s not a major priority for me.\r\n* I’m not a dog person: I don’t mind other people’s dogs, but I don’t want to take care of one. I like cats and some other pets, though.\r\n* My sleep schedule is currently something like 11:30pm-7:30am. I’m not a morning person.\r\n* I do not like beaches; mountains and forests are great.\r\n* I much prefer cooler weather to hot weather.\r\nMiscellaneous \r\n* I’m 5’10”.\r\n* My financial situation is, in all honesty, not particularly great at the moment. While I don’t have too much student debt, I wasn’t earning much during grad school, and I’m currently working on research independently with grant funding from some EA orgs while I look for more permanent employment. (On the plus side, I don’t have any particularly expensive hobbies besides “living in the Bay Area”.)\r\n* I used to be mostly fluent in Hebrew when I was a kid, but at this point it’s very rusty.\r\n* While my extended family is pretty small, I have three siblings who mean the world to me.\r\nLooking For\r\n* I’m looking for a monogamous, long-term relationship, and ultimately a life partner.\r\n* I’d like to have kids at some point. I’m open to waiting for that, but I’m also open to starting a family within the next few years if I find the right person.\r\n* I’m looking for someone I can have interesting conversations with; I don’t have a checklist but some degree of overlap with my values and interests is obviously a plus.\r\n* I tend to take things fairly slowly in relationships.\r\n* I’m looking for an emotional/personal connection much more than a physical one; sex isn’t a very high priority for me (though of course nice to have).\r\n   * I am into kink (switch). But as I said, this is a fairly low priority – it isn’t a strict requirement for me that you also be into this, I think something more vanilla is fine too.\r\n* Regarding location, I’m currently in the Bay Area because it’s the best place to do AI safety research, and I like the large rationalist community here. However, my family and friends are mainly in the Northeast, so I’m open to potentially moving back there in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve read this far and are still interested, get in touch!

      "fullText": "﻿Tab 1\r\n👋Hi, I’m David, looking for a long-term partner. Here’s me:\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n* Embodied and physical. Awareness of your body, and spend some time living in it. Dance, climbing, martial arts, etc.\r\n* Intelligent, independent minded. Enjoy discussion. Less swayed by social consensus.\r\n* Love nature. Hiking, camping, or just being outside.\r\n* Warm & caring. Touch, affection, silliness. Care towards others.\r\n* Sexually compatible. High libido, playful.\r\n* Ambitious, purpose driven. Achieving your goals is part of your identity.\r\n* Self-aware. Boundaries, desire for growth, introspection of eg your motivations.\r\n* Social. Enjoy hosting. You don’t need to be a massive extravert.\r\n* Open to kids.\r\n* Feminine.\r\n* Laughs at my jokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n🎮 Give yourself 0-2 points for each, 3-4 if you’re exceptional. If you score ≥ 18, then you get to go on a date with me. I heard that cocky funny still works even if you get annoyed.\r\nAbout me\r\nI’m 38, 5”8, living in London (open to the Bay Area). Probably monogamous.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent years working to solve AI reasoning before LLMs were big. Now moving to Anthropic to help AI go well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI host creative events, including a pancake party with pañata monster, and an ANT PARTY celebrating the final days of the human empire. I write at epsilonzero.substack.com. I enjoy making unconventional art, including 19 hours on a disassemblable cardboard troll bar for a friend's leaving party, and soon a big shiny 'Z'.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love and want kids. Flexible on parenting style, and I can afford a nanny whether or not you work.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made a flowchart. This is me, attributes (blue), things I do (pink):\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf interested, contact via this form or email with your first date preference: physical (e.g. Rowan Tenpin Bowling, Crazy Golf), co-creating art, or howling at the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy you might not want to date me?\r\n* My empathy is more analytic than reflexive, meaning I see multiple points of view. But if you’re with me, I’ve always got your back.\r\n* You don’t like mathematicians with cool glasses.\r\nPhotos\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis could be us.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently we look similar.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI occasionally go to burns.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI put this in to show off my climbing skills and definitely not my body"

Kiran is a South Asian man with medium brown skin and close cut black hair. He wears a long sleeved button up collared shirt and dark jeans with Hokas. India is a golden retriever. He wears a guide dog harness and sits beside Kiran.  \r\n    Kiran and India in front of a brick building. Kiran wears a burgundy polo and jeans with Hokas. He smiles broadly toward the camera. India leans against Kiran's leg.      Kiran and India in front of the Ed Sullivan Theatre, having just attended the taping of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  \r\nJourney So Far\r\nHello world! - I was born in India, spent a bunch of years in the UK, and now call Berkeley home with my golden retriever guide dog, India. I travel to Seattle pretty regularly for work (1-2 weeks monthly), and through a mix of work and personal adventures, I've been fortunate enough to explore more than 30 countries over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\nI work as a Principal Product Manager for Accessibility at a large e-commerce company, making sure everyone can shop online regardless of ability. I did similar work at other big tech companies. Having access to tech changed my life massively as a blind person, so I'm pretty passionate about making that happen for others too.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been blind since birth, and it's just one part of who I am. I've figured out how to adapt and be independent - honestly, it's made my life an adventure. By the way, I did not name my guide dog “India” for my country of birth. It was just a coincidence. I’ll tell you the story when we talk! If you're curious about how blind folks navigate technology or daily life, don't hesitate to ask. Or check out \"The Tommy Edison Experience\" on YouTube -  that guy is hilarious.\r\nPassions & Interests\r\nMusic: I'll listen to almost anything with a good beat - Bollywood, reggae, Irish folk, Ed Sheeran (current favorite), Indian and western classical stuff... just please don't make me sit through heavy metal! Oh, and I just sing a lot, at home, in the shower or when the mood strikes me.\r\nReading: Total bookworm here. Growing up blind in India meant limited access to books, so now I'm making up for lost time. Huge Harry Potter fan, and currently obsessed with epic fantasies like Game of Thrones and anything by Brandon Sanderson. Sometimes I need a mental break and switch to something funny.\r\nTrains & Travel: Ok, I'll admit it - I'm a complete train nerd. Building an N-scale model railroad layout with a friend's help, and even treated myself to a sleeper cabin on the California Zephyr for my 40th birthday. I went for the experience but I was reliably informed by fellow passengers that the views of the rockies are amazing! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork in progress of a railroad tunnel through a rock cliff. Model of a red rock cliff on a table in a garage. The strata is visible through horizontal divots.  Train tracks come out of the tunnel on  both the right and the left.     A train with a locomotive and two cars emerges from the tunnel portal which is made of card stock. The tunnel  portal is flat and still under construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n A back view of the red rock cliff with train tracks extending to the right. The tracks bend back in a horseshoe. Green hills are visible on the other side of the table.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nI've been lucky enough to visit some incredible places - getting lost in Marrakech's medina with all its amazing smells and sounds, exploring the ancient temples at Angkor Wat, finally walking through Istanbul's Grand Bazaar after reading about it for years. Travel bucket list still includes Yellowstone, Caribbean islands, South America, and Australia/New Zealand. Oh, and a proper American road trip!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kiran and India before the Napa Valley Wine Train. \r\n     Kiran stands in front of the Galata tower in Istanbul, Turkey. \r\n\r\n\r\n Kiran on boat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Kiran sits in a helicopter pilot seat. He grins as he fiddles with the controls.  \r\n     Kiran wades in calf-deep clear water before a small waterfall.    \r\n\r\n\r\nNeighborhood Explorer: I'm big on exploring neighborhoods on foot - whether it's discovering hidden food gems in the bay area or wandering a new city. Did a full-day food walking tour in Istanbul once, sampling street food along the way - absolute heaven! Closer to home, I also love things like hiking the Bay Trail or spending a day exploring a new spot like Angel Island.\r\nFood: Serious weak spot for good food - especially anything with creative spices. Thai cuisine is probably my favorite, but I'm game to try most things. Not really into bland food (British years taught me what that's like).\r\nCurrent Projects: Learning conversational Spanish (hope it goes better than my failed piano experiment!). My native language is an Indian language called Telugu, and I also speak two other Indian languages, Hindi and Kannada fairly well. Can order food in very basic Thai - useful skill when you love Thai food as much as I do!\r\nMy Approach to Life\r\nI'm definitely on the introverted side, but a good listener. Happy to chat about anything interesting but equally comfortable with quiet moments - not every silence needs to be filled, right?\r\nFriends would describe me as loyal, curious about everything, and open-minded. I try not to judge others - we've all got our own paths.\r\nI serve on the Board of Trustees for a national blindness non-profit, which feels like a way to give back. Sometimes I do podcasts and write blog posts about blindness awareness. Not trying to change the world single-handedly, but if I can help shift perspectives a bit, that's something.\r\n\"Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.\" - Dumbledore said it better than I could!\r\nWhat I'm Looking For\r\nLooking for something real and lasting. I want to find someone who's as curious about the world as I am - someone open-minded, kind, and who finds good conversation as enjoyable as comfortable silence.\r\nWant a partner who's up for adventures, both local (Bay Area has some great spots to discover) and eventually international when schedules allow. I travel for work pretty regularly, but I'm committed to building something solid with the right person.\r\nI'm a firm believer that relationships should expand our worlds, not shrink them. I'm hoping to find a partner to build a life with.\r\nDeal-Breakers\r\n• No smokers or heavy drugs \r\n• No judgmental or conservative people\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunication & Dating Style\r\nI'd rather meet in person after establishing some basic compatibility - that's when you really know if there's a connection. I'm pretty straightforward, and appreciate the same in my partner.\r\nLong-Term Vision\r\nI don't have children and have made the personal decision not to have them in the future. I respect others' choices regarding parenthood and am looking for someone with similar life goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've built a good life in the Bay Area but would consider relocating for the right relationship. Looking for a partnership where we both have room to grow individually while building something meaningful together.\r\n \r\nSo much world still to explore, so many experiences to share. Hope our paths cross soon!\r\nGet in Touch\r\nIf something here resonated with you, reach out through this form, or shoot me a DM on Instagram or email me at kirankaja12@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated March 2025"

      "fullText": "﻿Hey! I’m Abe, and I thought I’d share a bit about myself, in case I sound like the sort of person you’d like to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things I like to do:\r\n* Theater. I’ve been acting since preschool, and it’s my biggest hobby. I like everything from Shakespeare[1] to Rocky Horror[2], and I try to be in at least a couple community theater productions a year.\r\n* Engineering. Yes, my day job is as a software engineer, but there’s so much to engineering besides software. I have hobby projects in everything from electronics to architecture, and I try to apply an engineering mentality to a lot of everyday problem-solving.\r\n* Games. I play Dungeons & Dragons (usually running the game) and other tabletop roleplaying games, as well as board & card games such as Magic: the Gathering. I had a chess phase in middle school but was never very good at it.\r\n* Bicycling. I bike as a means of transportation, not so much as a sport, but I do enjoy it, and avoiding dependence on cars is important to me.\r\n* Crafts & home improvements. I’ve built a few pieces of furniture for myself, and done a number of repairs and upgrades around my house. I still contract out the big stuff, but I like having the option of doing things myself.\r\n* Reading. While the internet has somewhat supplanted physical books for me, I still consider myself an avid reader, mostly of fantasy and sci-fi. My preference is for optimistic and/or silly stories over the dark & gritty style that seems to dominate these days, so it should come as no surprise that Terry Pratchett’s Discworld is my favorite series.\r\n* And much more. I can find something to enjoy in practically any creative activity, from linguistics to cooking to politics. A couple of the skills I’m currently trying to learn are singing and videography.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic biographical details:\r\n* 29 years old ❖ male (albeit somewhat gender-apathetic) ❖ primarily attracted to women ❖ single ❖ open to mono- or polyamorous relationships, or just new friends ❖ 6 ft tall (1.82 m) ❖ vegetarian ❖ not religious ❖ doesn’t smoke, drink alcohol, or do any other recreational drugs ❖ fully vaccinated ❖ night owl\r\n* I live alone in Richmond, California (in the East Bay, just north of Berkeley). Not looking to move any time soon, but I might be open to having you move in if we get along well enough.\r\n* I work full-time as a software engineer at an aerospace startup, Astranis Space Technologies. We make communications satellites to bring internet access to underserved areas (and we might also be building the next Global Positioning Satellite constellation).\r\n* I grew up in Santa Cruz, but have also lived in Seattle, Nijmegen, and Santa Barbara.\r\n* I have Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in computer science from UC Santa Barbara (College of Creative Studies).\r\n* I usually vote Democratic, and consider my politics to be mostly progressive, though with some libertarian leanings.\r\n* I don’t currently have any pets, though I love them. My family had cats growing up—I am slightly allergic to them, but that won’t stop me. I’d love to meet any pets you have.\r\n* I’m autistic.[4] I got a diagnosis a few years ago, though in retrospect it should have been obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a relationship:\r\n* Fun conversations. I’ve got a lot of things I want to talk about, from interesting things I’ve learned to projects I’m working on to fundamental philosophical questions, but even better is to sit back and listen as you share something you’re passionate about.\r\n* Physical intimacy. This doesn’t have to mean sex (though that’s great too), but I want to cuddle, to hug, to hold hands. Even better if you initiate.\r\n* Shared activities. We could build something together, go on a bike ride or a hike, or just stay in and watch a movie. Lots of things are more fun as a couple, and it’s easier to go through with something high-effort but rewarding if you’re doing it with someone else.\r\n* Stability. Knowing that we can depend on each other, and that we’ll be there for one another. I don’t want either of us to doubt how the other feels.\r\n* I might be open to having kids, with the right person, but I’d be perfectly fine without as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my values:\r\n* Curiosity. Each new task is an opportunity to learn something. A surface-level understanding, like one might get from Wikipedia, is enough for a casual interest, but when something grabs my attention I want to get into as much detail as possible.\r\n* Charity. I haven’t formally taken the Giving What I Can pledge, but I do donate 10% of my gross earned income each year to effective charities (currently just Givewell).\r\n* Preparedness. My friends turn to me when they need a phone charger, a bandage, or a bobby pin. I’ve taken Wilderness First Aid training, keep a deep pantry, and motivate myself to exercise with the idea that I’ll need to be fit in an emergency.\r\n* Humor. It can take me a while to warm up enough to someone to make jokes around them, but once I do, I’m sure I can crack you up.\r\n* Predictability. While I’m definitely open to new experiences, I find it much easier to enjoy them if I’ve had a chance to plan and research in advance. Surprises are stressful.\r\n* Communication. Yes, it’s a cliché, but I really value being explicit in what you want. I’m not always great at picking up on social cues, so please tell me directly, and I’ll try to do the same for you.\r\n* Kindness. There are a lot of awful things in this world, but we should never be them. I strive to see the best in everyone, to never raise my voice in anger, and to genuinely care about people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out\r\nIf you think we might be a good fit, or just want to chat, text me at (831) 419-9368 or email me at abe.karplus@gmail.com. I hope to hear from you soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions[5]\r\n* Q: Is there a spot open in your D&D group?\r\nA: Yes, and if you’re interested (and interesting) enough, it might be yours.\r\n* Q: What’s your personality type / star sign / Hogwarts house?\r\nA: I don’t put much stock in any of these, but INTP / Pisces / mostly Ravenclaw but some Hufflepuff.\r\n* Q: You haven’t said much about the sort of person you’re looking for. Why not?\r\nA: I think I could be compatible with a wide range of people, and I don’t want someone wonderful to exclude themself just because they don’t exactly match whatever description I gave.\r\n* Q: What’s your favorite Shakespeare play?\r\nA: I don’t (yet) have an overall favorite, but my favorite of the comedies is Much Ado About Nothing, largely because Beatrice and Benedick feel like the only Shakespearean couple who actually are a good fit for each other, not just thrown together for the sake of the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis page was last updated 13 Mar 2025.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I’m currently in a production of Coriolanus with Bard Theatre of San Francisco.\r\n[2] The shadowcast I’m in, BLRHPS, performs about once a month, mostly in San Jose.\r\n[3] Photo by Haley Masch. Costume design by Becky Milanio Koupparis. All other photos on this page are self-portraits.\r\n[4] I prefer this phrasing over e.g. “person with autism”. It’s part of who I am, not a separable property. Consider how weird saying “I’m a person with height” sounds instead of “I’m tall”.\r\n[5] I haven’t necessarily been asked all of these, I just like the Q&A format.\r\n[6] No AI was used in the making of this page—all awkward phrasings in it are my own."

      "fullText": "﻿In as many words\r\n\r\n\r\nTo love and be loved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nA deeper understanding and a genuine human connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship which should last a lifetime, and children, who I would like to see grow old.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI've probably done all of my imbibing, but when I do, I tend to have a cigarette. I don't do drugs. I like walking and running, and I'm thankful for my health. I can drive, but don't. I'll be moving into a home I'll actually own sometime in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm learning to play the piano and hope to become quite proficient at it. I cook a lot, and don't mind vegetables in the slightest. I'm fascinated by physics, yet barely understand. I believe consciousness is a lot like a colour - entirely subjective.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan't survive without music: Floating Points, Róisín Murphy, Daniel Avery, HAIM, Kelly Lee Owens, HAAi, Ezra Collective, Lee Bong Geun, Mozart.\r\n\r\n\r\nReading: Tom Robbins, David Mitchell, Iain Reid, Phillip K. Dick, Cixin Liu, Haruki Murakami.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm: Wes Anderson. And his complementary polar, Roy Andersson. Luc Besson, Guillermo del Toro, Coen brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTV: Mad Men, The Office (only seen American), The Good Place, Gogglebox, Big Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman of the world. Who has a real flair - instruments, languages, knowledge, conversation. Who blossoms rather shies away. An assuredness in herself - and I certainly don't want to be in competition! I'd prefer it if we talked with one another, and that we did this more than we talked about one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot more important than all of that, is a load of love and care.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't exactly had an easy time in this world. I wouldn't want to dwell, but I've missed a lot of the joy and happiness. So to be reminded of such is a real treasure for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit more about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it difficult to do some of the social aspects - which everyone else seems to be able to do - such as, to keep on top/point with the collective discussion; or find the relative clause with the fulcrum in a conversation. I'd probably be a bit better at it if there weren't the games, though. I haven't been diagnosed with autism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a bit of a realist, swaying towards the negative, but idealistic. — An empire is only in a mind! — A pensive deliberator, holistic narrator, where the only aim is to make sense and better understand. Physics is literally everything…\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funniest part about physics is that it's not magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not that serious! I flunk every test, simply because I can… If I'm being told, I need to ask… I'm about as competitive as a wet sock... \r\n\r\n\r\nI hate conflict, but, even still, I could argue until the end of time - I just don't see the point! I don't hold any deep-seated beliefs - about this, or that. I think it's healthy to formulate an opinion, and especially, to care. I'm tired by the general discourse. Politics is literally everything…\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly when humankind brings to an end the endeavour for prosperity, and instead works for the good of humanity, shall we truly prosper and realise wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, as I see it, today...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen everyone is fooling everyone, everyone is a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams and aspirations\r\n\r\n\r\nA job is a job for me. When I dream about my ideal home, it'd be supportive and positive. Lots of time for one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship needs to be tender. I have endless patience, care and concern for the right woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nA side note\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are no more intelligent than, even our earliest ancestors, we simply know more. Our evolution benefits from cooperation, as much as competition, if not more so by cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel, if you spend enough time with a person, you get to know one another, becoming forgiving, inclined, adaptable, agreeable, aligned and assured by them. You grow around one another, in any relationship, community, team, job and life. I'd only hope that we grow together."

      "fullText": "﻿Brad Levin’s Dating Profile[1]\r\nLast updated: Mar 2025\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nI’m a straight man, poly, 41, living in Sunnyvale, California, half the time with my 7 and 8 year-old children and the other half solo.\r\nWork\r\nI’m a product manager at Google in HR information systems, been there for 8 years; Yahoo and Silicon Valley Bank before that (check out LinkedIn for my deets).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nA few selections from recent years; more on Facebook. \r\nWhy date me?\r\n-Friends describe me as caring, a good listener, energetic, creative, fun, supportive, and reliable \r\n-Romantic partners have mentioned touch and my proactive communication about tough/vulnerable issues\r\n-Values alignment if effective altruism, fitness, family, and lifelong learning are important to you\r\n-We could go to musicals, concerts, performances, conferences, and travel together\r\nDating partner must haves\r\n-Bay area-local\r\n-Female\r\n-------------------------------------- Nice-to-haves section -------------------------------------- \r\nIf basics are enough for you, stop reading now and skip to the Connect with Me section below. If not, feel free to peruse these nice-to-haves: I’m sharing so the particularly curious have a more informed idea of me as a potential dating partner.\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nI’m mostly looking for a primary partner, but am open to other structures.  You can find more detail on my OKC and Plura profiles; including excerpts below. \r\nAlso: what I want may change! I’m open to the possibility of meeting someone great who has in mind a different type of relationship. I also recognize people often don’t know exactly what they want in a relationship, including me. \r\nChildren\r\nI don’t want to father additional children, but am open to dating a woman who already has them. \r\nI’m open to a long-term romantic partner taking an active role in my children’s lives, but I’m not seeking that involvement (I’ve been divorced several years and my parenting status quo is working well). \r\nDating radius\r\nIt's so juicy when the two people dating are proximal! Since I'm not willing to drive farther, I try hard to date folks who live within 20 or so minutes from me in Sunnyvale (or have an unusual situation, e.g. work nearby or don't mind driving to my place disproportionately).\r\nAge\r\n28–49 years old (though this isn’t a strict range)\r\nLiving together\r\nI’m open to and interested in cohabitating with a primary partner, but that’s not a dealbreaker. \r\nOutdoors\r\nMy favorite outdoor activity is tennis, though I also love swimming and frisbee and basketball and frequently run, walk, kayak, and hike outdoors.\r\nBooks\r\nCurrently reading:\r\n-Untamed by Glennon Doyle\r\n-Polysecure by Jessica Fern\r\n-What we owe the future, by William MacAskill\r\nMore Details\r\nPeople close to me have recognized that I’m especially: (i) curious—about the big picture and systems and ideas, (ii) highly organized, (iii) trustworthy, and (iv) sensitive. Myers-Briggs from years ago): ENTJ. Top 5 CliftonStrengths: Harmony, Discipline, Learner, Consistency, Achiever.\r\n🚩Red flags for primary partners 🚩:\r\n1. Pseudoscientific beliefs, e.g. in astrology, manifesting, crystals, non-physics “energy”\r\n2. Criticize often \r\n3. Perennially late and forgetful\r\nWhat’s most important to me; unlikely to change:\r\n* My commitment to parenting\r\n* Involvement in effective altruism (since 2011)\r\n* Staying healthy, e.g. through regular exercise, decent diet, and taking mental health seriously\r\n* Social involvement , e.g. hosting events with friends and community\r\n* Non-religious\r\n* Intellectual pursuits: consuming and discussing podcasts, books, articles, and news\r\nIdeal partner\r\nI completed a relationship workshop that resulted in clarity about what I'm curious/interested (but not in any way expecting) to experience in an anchor romantic partnership. I'll list below some of that clarity; however, due to some feedback I received from a couple female friends, I've now updated this intro paragraph to make sure nobody reads the below as a list of requirements or expectations of a potential partner (which it is definitely not). Please consider the below as predilections and preferences, rather than a checklist of must-haves!\r\nA) Acceptance of my non-monogamy.\r\nFor me to feel like I fully belong in the relationship, I've learned it's critical that my partner openly accepts me having multiple simultaneous romantic relationships, and that I retain the autonomy to pursue new ones.\r\nB) Attraction/chemistry.\r\nI am huge into touch, value sleeping together (in the literal sense), and love doing erotic stuff.\r\nC) Perception that we're close peers.\r\nThis one took a lot of work to develop/unwind/discover in the workshop, and though I've learned it's important for me I'm still not yet sure why. In any case, what does \"close peers\" mean for me? Here's my best articulation, in five points; many of the examples derive from experiences in my own life and illustrate similar life experiences or attributes I seek in a partner.\r\n\"Close peer\" #1: Overachiever. Doesn't much matter in what domain - maybe you're an elite gamer, or excel in fitness classes, or a director where you work, or finished your doctorate while founding a company, or pioneered a popular new form of tarot card therapy (yes I've encountered that latter 🤣).\r\n\"Close peer\" #2: Leader. This might look like you teaching the class, running the workshop, organizing the campaign, driving the process change. Or that you lead by following, e.g. influencing others to put a full effort into the workout, modeling an innovative collaborative learning approach in the classroom that other students adopt, taking the meditation lesson to heart, signing the Giving Pledge and posting it in your house for others to follow.\r\n\"Close peer\" #3: Wild. The freedom and power that comes from intentionally breaking a significant social rule, then thriving afterward. Perhaps you left a religion, risked your education by standing up for something unpopular, exited monogamy, or something comparably high-stakes that risked enduring family or social rejection or job loss.\r\n\"Close peer\" #4: Seasoned. The maturity that comes from enduring a few hard knocks. Maybe you grew up in a household that lacked food security, or your baby died, or you weathered a disability you found difficult, or a parent neglected you.\r\n\"Close peer\" #5: Mentally healthy. You regularly have more spoons than you need to make it through the day, and are more often than not positive and open and emotionally available.\r\n-Someone recently asked me to describe \"my tribe.\" I haven't found mine yet: but an overachieving altruist that wants to overachievingly altruist a bit harder as a result of their primary relationship, sounds like a kindred spirit to me.\r\nExpectations\r\n-I've learned that I expect roughly equal participation when it comes to the work of initiating, planning, and organizing. That means voicing the time and place and activity of proposed dates, initiating touch, proposing dinner plans, etc. should be shared roughly equally (rather than the male doing the disproportionate labor in these areas, as is the norm in heterosexual dating). This also applies to the vulnerable work of initiating the relationship conversations that are needed for a healthy relationship.\r\n-I've also learned that my communication style merits calling out, since I have a particular approach that I've found perturbs some, while prompting others to offer kudos. My approach is this: I try to match the communication mode to the importance of the subject. To illustrate, let's say you're texting me with concerns about where we ate dinner last night. I will try to elevate the mode of communication to something real-time such as a phone call, video chat, or in-person discussion. I might even (gasp!) call you in response to your text.\r\nIn general, the more that feelings are involved or the stakes are high, the more I'll advocate to elevate the mode of communication (text < call < vid chat < in person). My reasoning is: the communication modes higher up the chain offer richer understanding since they include some or all of tone, pace, the opportunity to clarify, more words, pauses (and their absence), facial cues, and the accountability of a real-time conversation. This means fewer assumptions and more information, which I believe improves the odds of the desired twins of communication: (1) understanding and (2) being understood.\r\nThe downside is this approach requires hopping on a call, which some find less comfortable than texting, and can require a modicum of scheduling or driving to the partner, which texting doesn't. Know that for subjects like relationship status and where concerns are involved, I expect the conversation to be real-time, and I will engage using that mode where feasible.\r\nConnect With Me\r\nIf you’d like to get to know me better or just have something to say to me after reading this, feel free to Facebook message or email me.\r\nShare With Someone\r\nLink to share easily: bit.ly/dateBrad\r\n________________\r\n[1] A hat tip to Gina, whose bit.ly/dategina provided much of the structure and ideas you see above (used w/permission).

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me - Ja\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone inspired me to write this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt feels strange writing something like this for strangers to read, but it’s a bit better than a dating profile that lacks so much information and results in perhaps not the best decision making.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find any of this a tad interesting then please reach out and perhaps we can get to know each other in person.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doc is a work in progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGender: Male\r\nLocation: Watford, UK\r\nYear of birth: 1987\r\nHeight: 5ft 9\r\nEthnicity: East Asian\r\nSexual orientation: Straight - looking for a woman\r\nLocation: London, UK\r\nLanguages: English, Mandarin\r\nAttachment style : Fairly secure, tendency to be anxious.\r\nLove languages: Favourites are acts of service, physical touch, quality time. But to be fair, I respond well to all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in China and moved to the UK when I was little.\r\nWe moved around a few times in my childhood and I’d say it shaped me quite a lot. There are positives and negatives to this and I feel that slowly I’m experiencing more of the positives than I did as a child and young adult.\r\nAll of my education has been in the UK so I’m quite a mix of cultures, but I see that as an adult I’m probably more British (if I had to lean a particular way) than Chinese given my environment and social group. With that said, I always felt a bit of an outsider - quite introverted, very different home life compared to my peers at school, one life at home and a completely different life outside of home - things felt a bit disjointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife situation:\r\n* I work in marketing and recently went freelance (again) - it’s busy - I work from home\r\n* I’m a homeowner (and recent cat owner - yes, she’s very cute, and yes she’s occasionally a menace)\r\n* I can drive and have a car\r\n* I can get into all of central London in less than an hour\r\n* I don’t smoke or take drugs - I tend to be a minimalist when it comes to \r\n* I only drink socially and occasionally - recently I’ve been not drinking at all due to a meditation programme I’m preparing for (March 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m like\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat inspires me\r\n* People who care about others\r\n* People who work for something greater than themselves\r\n* People who are willing to surrender to life and allow\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not saying I aspire to be all of these things, but they certainly inspire me\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy\r\n* One-on-one conversations with my friends, and the occasional stranger.\r\n* Cooking and eating - especially if other people are involved.\r\n* Going on hikes, cycling, camping, going up mountains, road trips, natural environments.\r\n* I love the Scottish Highland, and Edinburgh (very happy childhood memories).\r\n* I’ve recently rehomed a cat called Mura - she’s cute and an occasional menace. So, now I’m a cat person in the making. I had a hamster as a kid but it didn’t really like me and I wasn’t too fond of him either so that doesn’t really count.  \r\n* I enjoy conversations about the future, technology, life, what we’ve learnt about ourselves, other people’s stories.        \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personality (at least my blind-spot ridden perspective of it)\r\n   * Ambivert - quite happy in my own space in peace and quiet, but totally down for being sociable with the right crowd. I tend to be quiet rather than needing to be vocal by default.\r\n   * I’m very close to a handful of friends. I feel blessed to have such friends and they are like family to me.\r\n   * I don’t enjoy small talk most of the time but when it’s about getting to know someone new then it can be fun too to begin with.\r\n   * I’m a dreamer. Perhaps I’m ADHD - I’m not sure. I daydream all the time (perhaps very compulsively) about everything. Business ideas, people and relationships, ways to improve the NHS, why my cat behaves the way she does, what a conversation meant several years ago, whether we can have a viable economy based on currency that has another dimension of value attached to it, about meditation and yoga practices, about the nature of birth and death, how people grow and develop, about why my circuit breaker tripped for several days but is now back up and working perfectly fine, if a curry sauce filled tofu ball would be good bit of food, …\r\n   * I’d say I’m quite spiritual but not in the usual sense of the word. I’m highly logical with an open mind. I don’t have beliefs. I’m purely in this life, with this body, with very limited perception of reality. But it is growing and I leave the door open.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValues\r\n   * Open-mindedness - to me this means not being bought into anything. Staying open to being shown something new or contrary to current perspective.\r\n   * Continuing to grow in awareness\r\n   * Moving towards doing what’s more right and relevant for the world - this is not to say do not respect personal wants, but just recognising that personal desires tend to be formed by the world we reside in and they are highly transient - and it relates to the point above. With growing awareness I recognise that my desires are a consequence of my physiology, emotions, and memories - and as I become more conscious in my actions then the interactions of those elements also change. So, my desires change when my consciousness changes. Moving towards choice of desire from compulsive desires.\r\n   * Rightness is debatable\r\n   * Authenticity - I do feel that everyone is already authentic, there is nothing about a being that isn’t - your actions and thoughts are not someone else's. I mean in the sense that we move towards growing awareness and express ourselves by our choice rather than by our compulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want in a relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have a companion to travel through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone to share with\r\n   * Food - I enjoy eating together, tasting new dishes (especially desserts )\r\n   * Maybe some hobbies and projects - but not a dealbreaker\r\n   * A home\r\n   * Ideas and thoughts\r\n   * What else?\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone to learn from and learn with.\r\n   * Intellectual curiosity - talking about concepts, situations, the future, history and bouncing ideas feels important to me.\r\n   * A drop of spiritual curiosity - some amount of thirst to know more of life, consciousness and what we/I don’t know.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who really wants me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone I really want to be with.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully, someone to have children with. So ideally aged between 25 and 35. But I’m not going to be strict on this - it’s just what seems to make sense given that desire.\r\nBut with that said, I’d rather live a happy life than have kids at great cost to wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical, emotional, and sexual intimacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utmost mutual trust that we’re in this together. Being on the same team.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalling out bullshit and being able to step in when needed. Not letting undesirable things just happen without being addressed. Again, same team - doing this together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities that I find attractive in a partner\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Feminine confidence\r\n   * Gentle temperament but not meekness\r\n   * Able to go with the flow as well as being adamant when needed\r\n   * A curiosity for life's mysteries\r\n   * Wittiness\r\n   * Intellectual intelligence to an extent\r\n   * Low maintenance and easy going nature - but still with a bit of fire\r\n   * Straightforwardness\r\n   * Adaptability (I may be projecting a bit here)\r\n   * Groundedness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome boundaries\r\n\r\n\r\nLong distance relationship - it’s a no for me. A LTR doesn’t feel real to me and seems like a dream life not real life. I know it can work for many people, but I don’t feel this is the situation I’d thrive in.\r\nPerhaps later on if there needs to be some distance due to short term work, looking after parents, etc then that’s fine - just doesn’t seem right to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like communication to be straightforward with no game playing. Don’t make it harder than it needs to be. I truly feel there are much better ways to use our energy than playing around with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we could have together\r\n   * A warm loving home and family where we nurture each other.\r\n   * Deep mutual trust that we are here for each other.\r\n   * Great intimacy - physically, emotionally, sexually, and any other way that comes to mind.\r\n   * Financial security and freedom - we can work on this together. So that we can pursue things other than careers and money motivated endeavours - do things that are more alive.\r\n   * Support each other in our pursuits. Even have some things that we pursue together.\r\n   * Have kids and grow into wonderful guides for them as they grow.\r\n   * Each of us puts effort into being the best for the other - then there will be no getting bored, things going stale, the flame dying out. Selfishly selfless route to endless passion and energy.\r\n   * Share in the responsibilities of life and home. As equally as possible. Recognising that it doesn’t necessarily mean the physical actions are completely equal. But we do what’s needed.\r\n   * A really fun time and fun life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said, that is my brain dump for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s meet!\r\n\r\n\r\njyue87 [at] gmail [dot] com"

      "fullText": "﻿January 2025\r\nAbout me\r\nI am 23, I live in Oxford, studied in my native Australia, and grew up mainly in India.[1] I feel moved by the plight of current people and non-human animals, but also find persuasive the basic longtermist argument that the future is big and important and changeable. So for now I am trying to help make the transition to AGI go well.\r\nYou can see some things about me on various places online, including the EA Forum, LinkedIn, Goodreads, Google Scholar, and my Substack subscriptions.\r\nThat is fairly cold and impersonal; it is perhaps more fun and interesting to get to know each other by talking. But for now, here are some less work-y things about me:\r\n* I like to read, play board games and ~any sport, hike and camp, talk about philosophy and physics and photosynthesis and occasionally non-alliterating things.\r\n* I am very honest and value open, frank, fairly direct communication with others. I tend to ask quite a few questions, mainly because I am curious to learn about other people’s experiences and ideas!\r\n* I am not very artsy; beyond the occasional poem (e.g. here, here), and some elegant mathematising if that counts, my creative output is meagre.\r\n* I have rather little familiarity with pop culture and I mostly do not regret this. But it means I wouldn’t be a very good conversationalist on such things.\r\nHere are some photos of me doing things I like. And this is what my[2] face looks like:\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nApart from demographic things (I have only ever been attracted to women, this seems very unlikely to change; being a somewhat similar age/life stage is helpful) and unsurprising things (one’s partner being kind and clever and caring and calm and courageous is always nice) I would like to be with someone who is:\r\n* Morally serious - the stakes are high; there is so much to protect; doing the right thing matters. I think I would struggle to deeply empathise with and respect someone who had a more blasé attitude to improving the world. It seems less important what exactly you care about and want to work on.[3]\r\n* Intellectually curious - talking about ideas is quite important to me, and it would be hard to spend lots of quality time with someone who isn’t interested in ideas. But what you study/studied, who your favourite philosophers are, what your favourite theorem is etc is less important.\r\nBeyond that, of course, it would be nice if we enjoyed some of the same activities, but I feel like that is more malleable.\r\nIt would clearly be nice to live near each other, but I am open to exploring a relationship with someone who currently lives far away.[4]\r\nI am open to ~any preference on whether to have kids, I have quite mixed thoughts.[5]\r\nYou can email me at oscardelaney0@gmail.com.\r\n________________\r\n[1] My parents were doing ‘global health and development’ work before it was cool in EA ;)\r\n[2] Is my past self really ‘me’? What is the relationship between ‘me’ and ‘my face’? Tricky questions!\r\n[3] I care quite a bit about EA as a project, and somewhat about EA as a community. It might be helpful if you do too, but I think the ‘morally serious’ frame of mind is the more important part.\r\n[4] I quite like living in Oxford, but would be open to moving for the right (work or romantic!) opportunity.\r\n[5] I like spending time with kids and would all else equal prefer to be a parent (and am generally pro-natalist!). But all else isn’t equal, e.g. if AGI comes this decade it could be a very tumultuous few years where I want to focus fairly hard on work without caring for young kids. But I don’t know."

      "fullText": "﻿Email: tom.arrow42@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Keith\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\nWhy am I single?  \r\n* My work life (sea below) has taken me out of the country for significant periods. \r\n* I used to be insecure about expressing romantic attraction, although this has been worked through.\r\n* My face is not very expressive, and I seem much colder than I actually am to a lot of people. I convey strong emotion much more with verbal explanation than with any visual cue.\r\n* The places I’ve lived are not bustling with like-minded people. \r\n\r\n\r\nBasic info\r\n* 5’8”/173cm \r\n* Straight  \r\n* Ideally looking for a monogamous relationship, but open to casual dating\r\n* Want children in 5-15 years, but I don’t think this is a dealbreaker\r\n* Muscular build, lean but not shredded\r\n* Atheist\r\n* 27 years old, British\r\n* Non-smoker, rarely drink but not teetotal\r\n* First-class Chemistry degree\r\n* Vegan\r\n* ~£50k salary, own a flat in Glasgow with a small mortgage\r\n* Highly extraverted\r\n* Main love language is physical touch, followed by quality time  \r\n\r\n\r\nWork life\r\nI’ve decided against publishing this on the Internet. Feel free to enquire. \r\n  \r\n\r\nCharacter traits\r\n   * Discipline, drive, and executive function\r\n   * Very low in neuroticism and anxiety, with a stable mood (I’ve got graphs lol)\r\n   * When I’m sad, I solve this through reflection and talking about it; “cheering me up” isn’t a thing\r\n   * Regrettably low in some kinds of curiosity\r\n   * Direct style of communication  \r\n   * Hard to offend\r\n   * Aside from a few skeletal anomalies that haven’t meaningfully limited me, I have excellent health (as do most of my family)\r\n   * Probably too invested in some kind of general protagonist identity, and working on being warmer and more human\r\n   * I very much have “cognitive empathy”; I care about people/things, but don’t feel their emotions with them.\r\n   * I’m becoming more disagreeable and willing to challenge people as I age. I’d like to believe I keep this constructive and make sure not to leave others feeling attacked. If your tortilla policy is mental, or I think a key part of your philosophy is wrong, you’ll hear about it. \r\n\r\n\r\nDaily routines\r\n      * I am more of a morning person; staying up late into the night without a good reason is not a thing for me\r\n      * I reach full alertness and energy exactly 20 minutes after getting up\r\n      * I rarely suffer from low energy and nap only infrequently\r\n      * This is predicated on my daily rhythm giving me good sleep and nourishing food, I absolutely crash without these\r\n      * My meals are very big, and I hardly snack. \r\n      * I abhor “killing time” at home and prefer to spend time intentionally. This most frequently comes up in relationships around partners wanting to spend lots of time watching TV/film. If you want me to do this, it’s best to sell me on why that show in particular is worth a deliberate decision to watch it. Just putting something on as a low-effort way to spend an evening will not fly. \r\n      * Work out 3 days on, 1 day off.\r\n      * Each night, I record what I did that day in a “Memory Book” and have every single day for 7 years. Be prepared to feature!  \r\n\r\n\r\nRomance & the Bedroom  \r\n         * Pretty happy with vanilla stuff, but I have discovered a dominant side and would like to explore this more. \r\n         * I’m not that kinky\r\n         * I’m not sure I would have believed it if I’d read this a few months ago, but I’ve unlocked a part of my mind that experiences sex in ways very similar to women: erogenous zones and mind-splitting orgasms that last several seconds and aren’t related to ejaculation. \r\n         * High libido and I actively want near-daily sex, but my desire to go for multiple rounds can be greatly hampered by not having eaten enough or physical tiredness\r\n         * You’ll generally get a lot more out of me by starting early in the evening, or earlier in the day, with a coffee\r\n         * *friends mocking me for going to the Roomba recharge station*\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve had one relationship lasting a year, a handful of four-month relationships, and a fair number of short-term flings or one-off encounters. I’m in touch and on good terms with many of these people, and don’t hold grudges with any. None of these were “bad breakups”, and I have never fought with a romantic partner. My longest relationship was polyamorous for the second half. I feel we made this work, and it is something I could continue doing. That being said, it came with costs that at present I would prefer not to pay in a long-term relationship. If you’re poly and otherwise think we could be a match, please don’t rule it out on these grounds!\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to take relationships quickly and am comfortable living together earlier than most, I think. As I grow close with people, I can become an absolute Snuggle Bear, but this is dependent on chemistry. A friend with benefits, who I cherish but do not feel this chemistry with, instead described me as a “Roomba”...\r\n  \r\n\r\n________________\r\nShow, don’t tell\r\n  \r\n\r\nI host a lot of events for my friends. This one was a “Dating Discussion Forum”, to give people a platform to have a frank, open conversation about their experiences with dating.   \r\n\r\n\r\nWarhammer is my main hobby. Painting the miniatures and playing the game with friends occupies the nerdy part of my mind most of the time.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve taken up the gauntlet to bag all of the Munros. I’ve hiked barely a tenth of them so far. Appetite to go up a hill with me is appreciated!  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a specific smile that comes out when I drink specialty coffee.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI’m a bit functional when I cook for myself, but I love putting effort into cooking for others!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fitness is very important to me. I was the least fit child at my primary school, and through consistent effort since, have achieved a number of things I am truly proud of. On a bad day, I can do 6 muscle-ups. Earlier this year, I joined the 1000-pound club in powerlifting. Now that I’ve leaned down again, I’ll run a mile in comfortably under 7 minutes, and 100m in 16 seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\n         * I can do sin(x) functions in my head, and could teach you how \r\n         * Made Richard Dawkins laugh\r\n         * Estimated to eat 92.3kg of houmous per year\r\n         * Exchanged typewritten letters with a romantic interest whose name I never knew through unsuspecting Berlin baristas\r\nYou\r\nBasic info\r\nThere are very few unequivocal green and red flags for me, and many different ways I can be attracted to a person. Most of my red flags are fairly common: jealous, controlling, unable to accept they are at fault, and boring. I list ones specific to me below.  \r\nGreen flags/nice-to-haves:\r\n         * Large breasts\r\n         * Muscular/athletic figure\r\n         * Confidence/assertiveness\r\n         * Aged 20-33\r\n         * Self-initiated passion projects, ideally nerdy ones\r\n         * Clear and open communication styles \r\n         * Outdoorsy/not dependent on creature comforts\r\n         * Morally motivated, seeking to make the world better\r\n         * Has done really hard stuff\r\n         * High IQ and at least middling EQ\r\nRed flags:\r\n         * Actively religious or superstitious\r\n         * Not vegan and unwilling to discuss my ethics on this with an open mind\r\n         * Significant lack of interest in their health, fitness, and longevity\r\n  \r\n\r\nWork life\r\nI want to date people who impress me, and a big part of that will usually come from their career goals. Ambition is helpful, but at a minimum, I want a partner to know who they are and what they are working towards. The minutiae of this are not so important to me, and there are very few professions that constitute red flags. Essentially, I want to be impressed by a woman’s grit. Tell me how hard you’ve worked and what you can overcome! \r\n\r\n\r\nFinances  \r\nI’d like to think I am generous with friends and partners, and recognise that there are (dwindling) expectations on a man to spend money on a woman. That being said, I am far more excited to date someone who sees being a homeowner as a signal of good financial security and executive function than someone trying to marry rich. I intend to donate too much money for that to ever pay off. With that said, I don’t have any expectations for a partner’s income or financial situation, provided that they can take care of themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bedroom\r\nI would like for a partner to be of a similarly high sex drive and be committed to this remaining an exciting activity. Ideally, an empty field in the summer would be a perfectly acceptable opportunity to get it on. Eagerness to understand my weird tantric capabilities, and consensual power imbalance would be much appreciated! There’s not much more of a filter I want to apply here; the rest can be figured out with dating.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you feel like we could be a match, feel free to reach out by email!"

      "fullText": "﻿Overview\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI’m building a life of impact, intellectual curiosity, physical activity, and a growth orientation. I’d like a partner who values and shares these areas, if not the specifics in each area. I can seem hard on the outside, but I’m a romantic and I promise that there’s a warm, soft core.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere’s how excited I can get about ideas! (Very old.)\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nIn a castle in Spain, after picking a padlock to get there.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nI accidentally got a cat during covid. I’m lucky to have a lot of friends who look after her when I’m traveling.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nNot my child. But isn’t she cute?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe basics\r\n* Male, age 44, seeking female, age approximately 35 to late 40s, for a monogamous relationship akin to (or actually) marriage.\r\n* I live in San Francisco. More below.\r\n* I don’t need to have children. I’d be excited about it with the right person, in specific situations. See below.\r\n* Email: m@redheron.com\r\n* Facebook profile. I don’t post much, and less publicly, but you can see mutual friends at least. Twitter. I don’t post much there either. It’s a bit out of date, but you can also find me on OkCupid.\r\nMore detail\r\nImpact\r\n* I’m involved in nuclear fusion, because I believe that the world needs clean, cheap, abundant, safe energy in order to limit climate change and create abundance.\r\n* I’m passionate about structural improvements to our governance systems. I’m also working on a software project (writeup) to help people vote faster, with more information.\r\n* I spend a lot of my time on another software project -- a collaborative note taker, task manager, etc. (That sounds boring, but I promise that it’s not!)\r\nIntellectual curiosity\r\n* I love discussing things that we’ve read or heard, or pondering how something works, or listening to/watching something together and trying to figure it out. I especially love finding people who are experts in some random field but are patient enough to let me question them about what they are doing, why it makes sense and how it works. I especially especially love tag-teaming this quizzing with a friend.\r\nPhysical activity\r\n* I run, ski, back-country ski, snow camp, backpack and mountain bike. At the moment I’m working on running further. Have you thought about how far one can run in a day, and how much further it is than we can backpack?! Imagine setting up a base camp in a national park somewhere and then running all over the place for a few days. You could see so much!\r\n* I’m totally excited to try your sports. These are just the ones that I’ve gotten sucked into so far.\r\n* I’d like to learn to dance. I’m pretty terrible at it, and cuban salsa did not go well, even after a year of trying. The next experiment is fusion (dance, not energy, in this case).\r\n* I’ve done a lot of urban exploration. I don’t do as much now, but I’ve picked every lock in the Conservatory Flowers in Golden Gate Park and I still love climbing cranes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth orientation\r\n* I’m not in coaching or therapy at the moment, but I’ve gotten a ton from coaching in the past.\r\n* I’m all over the various growth books and recently read Good Inside and The Courage to be Disliked.\r\n* I strive to improve my close relationships and bring my best self to them; and to take feedback gratefully.\r\n* Don’t confuse this for woo. I’m a rational atheist who wants to take the good stuff from the touchy-feely hippies, but also keeps discovering that they have more good stuff than I thought. (Who knew that blindfolded contact improv could be so much fun?)\r\nSampling of things that I like talking about\r\n* The world\r\n   * What's the right way to address climate change? And population growth?\r\n   * If you could change something about how American democracy works, what would it be? Is western democracy on a decline? How can we fix it? (I think that America may be on the verge of what I call the “New American Consensus”, and with it an era of great accomplishments.)\r\n* Tech\r\n   * What would I do if I had good VR/AR hardware?\r\n   * How can software be better? How can we build it better? What would a debugger designed for functional programming look like? (IMO: very different, and very awesome.)\r\n   * How can we collaborate more effectively?\r\n   * How will the world change when SpaceX gets Starship working?\r\n* Other\r\n   * How can I be kinder, warmer and gentler, but still help groups to get things done?\r\n   * How can I get into somewhere I shouldn’t?\r\n   * How can I travel with less gear?\r\nWhere I live\r\n* I live in San Francisco.\r\n* I’ve been here for nearly 25 years and know a lot of wonderful people.\r\n* I live in a community of 4 buildings, one big shared garden, 15 adults and 6 children (more planned or on the way!), 3 hot tubs and lots of cats. We each have our own units, so we don’t have to agree on how clean our kitchens, bathrooms, etc are. It’s co-livinging for grownups and it’s great. You might love it too. 😀\r\n* I’m loath to leave SF permanently but I’m also really eager to find an amazing partner and am willing to look in many other places for her. Europe (especially Berlin) and New York tug at my heart. I recognize that I might get lured away from SF, but I’ll also try to lure you here. Maybe we can travel a lot.\r\nChildren\r\n* I used to be pretty strongly opposed to having children. I’d be married at least twice by now if it weren’t for that.\r\n* I still don’t need to have children, but now I can now see a path where I’d be excited to have children: with a partner who is highly aligned on values and goals, and in a community like the one that I live in, with lots of social contact built in, so that parenting isn’t as isolating.\r\n* The two biggest things that changed my mind about children are (1) seeing how different parenting is when done in community, and realizing that the future will be less awesome if a whole group of us opt out of having children."

      "fullText": "Skip to content\nswyx’s Dateme\nGet Notion free\nswyx’s Dateme\nlast update: Jan 2025!\nHi! I’m Shawn and I dislike dating apps but want to take relationships seriously… so here’s my attempt at opting out of the system! Here’s the basic “what everyone asks” from dating apps:\n38yo Singaporean Chinese, 5’ 7.5’’ (171cm)\nLive in San Francisco/often in Singapore (but open to travel/moving to other major cities)\nnever married/no kids (want 26-40yo woman to marry and have kids)\ntechie (but not 100% techbro tho I was an engineer and do have a podcast and do some angel investing, don’t worry none of my exes have ever cared about that stuff haha)\nsinger (I’ve been in musicals, acapella, tiktok, teeny bit of guitar and violin. When I’m home there should always be something playing on the speakers, no exceptions!)\nwriter (people like my blog and book and short stories and newsletter and communities)\nfriendly, ambitious nerd (I sometimes run giant meetups and conferences)\nObsessions: Dropout.tv, Coupling, bouldering, runs with friends, Deep Work, Discworld, Powerful movies, good podcasts. Have had both dogs and cats but don’t currently have any, would love to\nMottos: Intentionality, Intensity, Integrity. Learning in Public. Playing Long Term Games.\nNot very religious but raised in Buddhist tradition, generally think souls and karma are real\nSocial drinker, never smoked, regular exercise\nObligatory Photo Wall\nAbout\nThe basic non-professional about page/linkedin gist is that I’ve grown up constantly straddling two worlds:\nspending half my life in Singapore and the other half in the US;\nspending half my career in finance (Wharton→UChicago→options trader→hedge fund) and then pivoting to tech for the second half (Two Sigma, AWS, 3 unicorn startups)\nbeing both very online and yet loving building IRL community.\nThe plus is I adapt/fit in easily, the downside is I have switched countries, cities, and social circles so much that my personal/social life isn’t where I want it to be — 3 serious relationships but always cut short basically by long distance due to work stuff. I think those days are done and I’ve “found my thing”, and am in a place where I want to seriously work towards being a life partner to someone who’s also ready for that!\nI get shy writing about myself but I’m forcing myself to in this new year so here are some other dating profile notes:\nValues: Commitment, Connection, Honesty, Vulnerability, Communication\nPersonality: Authentic, Empathetic, Passionate, Smart, Sociable\nInterests: Climbing, Running, Tennis, Music, Podcasts, Karaoke, traveling for friends instead of museums, Great TV/movie writing\nOther fun facts:\nI cut my own hair! Have done since Covid\nI used to make mixtapes that probably reveal way too much about my random interests\nsuper random but I won a contest for #1 Joss Stone fan in 2006 haha\nthe Cuba thing on my GitHub is real\nWhat I’m looking for\nI’m a very open minded person so this section is hard to write, because to some extent I believe that life has a way of challenging what you think you know about yourself. But literally every female friend insisted I write this down so here you go. Just know that basically none of these are hard requirements.\nDo I have a type?\nPhysically: Genuinely attracted to all races, and a wide range of body types, but yes historically have mostly dated Asian girls\nPersonality: Trustworthy, Funny, Low drama, Easy going, Spontaneous, Responsible. Smart-but-it’s-not-your-entire-identity. Tenacity, Grittiness, Creativity is hot as hell!\nGiant pluses:\nMusician - Singer, Pianist, Arranger/Composer, anything. We will make all the music!\nCareer in Healthcare/Law/traditional businesses - I gotchu on finance/tech (but finance/tech is cool too of course) but it’d be nice to balance that out\nzero issues with you making more than me if thats still a thing people get hung up on\nbut i’ll give you a run for your money :)\nWriter - the easiest tell of a beautiful mind. could fall in love just with good writing.\nCooking - I would LOVE to be your sous chef\nDancer - Mama said I was a dancer before I was born. I used to once, I don’t anymore; would love to get back into it without doing the creepy do-dance-classes-to-find-dates thing that so many guys seem to do?\nDog/Cat mom - I have lived with both, don’t currently have my own, pets are great\nBetter memory/aesthetic sense than me? :)\nProbable no’s:\nVery actively religious/political - I don’t mind it but you’ll be unhappy w my disinterest\nDefault sarcastic/cynical - I lean earnestcringe\nAuthoritarian/Statist - I value individual freedom/liberty with limits, dislike govt overreach\nCrypto/web3 - I’m not anti-crypto, but have been quite turned off by vapid vibey crypto girls. iykyk.\nOpen to living at least part time in Singapore - I do want spend time with my parents and amazing incredible sister who someday I hope you have the fortune to know as well as I do.\nhit me up!\nif you’re pickin’ up what i’m puttin’ down, find me on text or twitter or email! I like “can’t lose” first dates - a walk/hike, farmer’s market, dog rescue cuddles! Coffee is good tho I’m 99% a tea guy.\nSw yx\nJan 1\npreloved kids very welcome\nShow 1 reply\nSw yx\nJan 1\nplural kids: I waited 12 years for my sister and she is one of the best things in my life and everyone should have a sister, sisters are the best\n… more\nSw yx\nJan 1 (edited)\ndefinitely some % techbro but also have more writerbro/musicbro/community builder/financebro in me than traditional techbro\nSw yx\nJan 2 (edited)\nat least one endgame relationship has resulted from this and some day it’d be nice if it were my turn?\nSw yx\nJan 1\nI’ll be upfront that I value this but am not great at it and want to be better\nSw yx\nJan 1\naka “vibes” - the cliche is that we can be “alone together”\nSw yx\nJan 1\nyes, i’m a Taurus, people do ask so"

Whether we’re hanging out at home, playing games, or watching something fun, or heading out to explore new places, I imagine us having a relationship full of laughter, great conversations, and mutual support. We’d inspire each other to grow, share our passions, and make space for what truly matters to us, all while enjoying the everyday moments that make life special.\r\n\tHere’s a paragraph about me written by my husband: \r\n\tI’ve honestly never met anybody else like him. \r\nPensive, methodical, and startlingly intelligent; he has a very unique approach to life which I really admire. \r\nHe’s very quiet, gentle, and sensitive. He gets quite distressed by conflict, and he’s deeply passionate about the things he cares about. He’s incredibly kind, generous, and thoughtful, and he’s probably the most patient person I know. \r\nOh, he’s also incredibly silly and mischievous (when he gets to know you).\r\n\tHere’s a paragraph about me written by my girlfriend:\r\n\tPros: Aaron is extremely dependable and honest. I feel like I can tell him anything and he won’t judge me for it, but will also not jump to be agreeable with me (an autistic superpower!). Out of all my partners, he is the one I feel that I can share my deepest thoughts with. I know that if he says he will do something, he does. He’s pretty decent at physical directions, tech stuff, and organizational management, which is a huge + for me because I get to benefit off his help in these domains. \r\nCons: He is more talkative with people that he has already met a couple times before and generally prefers for other people to initiate/lead conversations. If you are bringing him to a social event where he doesn’t know others well, then you should try not to leave him to his own devices. Aaron also hasn’t dated many people in his life and therefore may not have the smoothest way to rizz you up. He is also a little bit clumsy, but is currently on a workout plan so that might change in the future. And he is allergic to cats (apparently), but with enough advance planning, he can be around cats for an extended period of time.\r\nOther considerations: I really value the impact-oriented life that he leads so the optimal UK girlfriend he gets should ideally actively support him in this way of life rather than be a distraction from it. I would be disappointed if he was derailed from the goal of reducing suffering as much as possible/practical in this world. \r\n\tAbout Me\r\n* Effective Altruism - I co-founded a charity called Shrimp Welfare Project (SWP) after going through the Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program. We focus on reducing the suffering of the billions of farmed shrimps. My work at SWP is probably the thing I’m proudest of in my life to date.\r\n“Shrimp welfare” can sound odd at first, but the pitch is surprisingly simple: \r\n* 230 billion shrimps are alive on farms at any moment, more than any other animal.\r\n* The evidence suggests they’re sentient and can suffer.\r\n* They often suffer through routine practices such as having their eyes cut off (to induce spawning) and suffocating to death at the end of their lives.\r\nCo-founding SWP was motivated by my deep desire to reduce suffering as much as possible, and it’s been a rewarding journey balancing pragmatism with ambitious goals. The work connects deeply with my values around compassion, effectiveness, and finding innovative solutions to neglected problems.\r\n* Autistic (self-diagnosed) - In 2023 it was mentioned to me that I might be on the autism spectrum. The more I looked into this the more it seemed to ring true, so I typically identify as being autistic (though I haven’t gone through a formal diagnosis). \r\nOne way in which this manifests is that I (currently) have an eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). It basically means I have a very limited diet of preferred foods, and the thought of eating other foods triggers a physiological fight-or-flight response.\r\n* Polyamorous - I’m in a polyamorous relationship currently, so you might hear me in one sentence talk about my husband, and in another sentence talking about my girlfriend. I’m married to a non-binary trans-guy (who is also in a relationship with a trans-woman). And I also have a cis-girlfriend.\r\nI consider myself to be straight (which is a little confusing as I’m married to a trans-guy). We dated for ~5 years before he came out as trans, and have found our romantic relationship still works well despite it no longer being sexual - which itself isn’t such a big deal when polyamorous. \r\nI think the definition of Relationship Anarchy appeals most to me, with all relationships just growing into whatever suits them best. That said, I find terms like \"nesting partner\" (for my husband) or \"Comet\" (for my girlfriend in America) helpful for explaining the dynamics.\r\nHobbies and Interests\r\n* Making & Creating: Projects and activities I enjoy to try and mindfully unwind.\r\n   * Animation: I love animated movies (my degree is in computer animation), particularly Pixar. I’m also writing a musical with my metamour about animation, which has been great fun.\r\n   * Musical Instruments: I enjoy picking up piano, ukulele, or drums in phases—mainly for the fun of seeing quick progress. Right now, I’m in a piano phase, though I often cycle back to the others.\r\n   * Construction Sets: Building LEGO (or Nanoblocks) is my go-to for unwinding. I have a desk setup in the living room to work on sets while watching TV with my nesting partner.\r\n* Media: Like most people an avid consumer of media… \r\n   * Reading: Generally non-fiction, my favourite book is Sapiens. I also love candid autobiographies like Strong Female Character, or I’m Glad my Mom Died. My Goodreads is here, if you’re curious.\r\n   * Music: The Beatles are my favourite band, and I love vintage covers (e.g., Postmodern Jukebox).\r\n   * Comedy: Game-changing shows such as Nanette, Inside, and Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999.\r\n   * TV & Film: Shows like The Good Place, Fleabag, and movies like The Cornetto Trilogy. I also enjoy so-bad-it’s-good films and ambitious narratives from Charlie Kaufman or Richard Linklater.\r\n   * Games: I love story-driven single-player games (The Last of Us series) and 100%-ing open-world games while listening to audiobooks. My favourite board game is Gloomhaven.\r\nWhat I’m Looking For\r\n* Relationship Style - I’m looking for a partner based in the UK to share romance and intimacy with. I deeply value my relationship with my nesting partner (we have a strong bond but not a sexual relationship) and my \"Comet\" girlfriend (though we only see each other every few months). So it feels strange to say as someone with two partners, but I sleep alone most nights, which surprisingly enough, is starting to feel quite lonely… \r\nWhat I feel I’m missing is a local-ish girlfriend (while I’m based in Liverpool, my idea of \"local\" is pretty flexible and would include most UK cities - especially London, where I spend a lot of time anyway). \r\nI’d love a relationship that fits a more traditional rhythm: seeing each other regularly, spending weekends together, or staying with each other for longer stretches when it works for us.\r\n* Good Vibes & Value Alignment - I’d love to connect with someone who feels like they just \"get it.\" A partner who resonates with sides of me like effective altruism or animal welfare. Sharing a passion for doing good and meaningful work would make our connection even stronger.\r\n* Love, Support & Growth - I’m seeking a relationship where we can genuinely care for and support one another. I want us to be partners in helping each other grow into our best selves, with plenty of encouragement and kindness along the way.\r\nMore Photos\r\n  \t  \r\n\r\nWelcome to More Photos…\r\n\t  Me and my girlfriend on the Brooklyn Bridge\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nMe and a friend in front of a shrimp-y column\r\n\t  Getting married!\r\n\t  Hanoi Train Street (after Asia Farm Animal Day)\r\n\t  Me and my now-husband, \r\nback when we first started dating in 2015\r\n\t  \r\nEnjoying a vegan cookie ice cream sandwich\r\n\t  In India during our team’s annual “Shrimposium” \r\n\t  \t  Getting my copy of Animal Liberation Now signed by Peter Singer!

      "fullText": "Skip to content\n❤️\nDate José\nGet Notion free\n❤️\nDate José\nI am looking for someone to date and eventually marry!\nUltimately finding someone is very simple: It’s just about being mutually attracted and excited about the possibility of building a life together (though you can also reach out for a less intense relationship!). The core requirements for that are:\nWe must be good communicators (Which in turn requires emotional competency, self-awareness, kindness, curiosity, and intelligence)\nWe must be mutually attracted (I’m straight)\nAnd we must vibe\nI hope you can judge communication from my writings and the kinds of things I do; attraction from my pictures. The vibe has to be experienced but unlike pictures, that doesn’t scale. So this document tries to convey my vibe through an explanation of my values, my life, and some anecdotes.\nMe on the internet\nShow; don’t tell, as they say:\nTwitterJosé Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente (@ArtirKel) on X​\nInstagram (@jlriconf)​\nJose Luis RiconNintil​\nAbout me\nI was born in Spain (Madrid) in 1992, then grew up in the Canary Islands to a height of 5’10’’. Eventually I went to college for too long, earning two masters degrees in mechanical engineering and aerospace dynamics.\nMy early career ambitions of doing actual rocket science got derailed by Life, and ended up in a series of jobs that started in the shop floor of an electric car company, an ended up in my current role as Head of Theory at Retro Biosciences. In between I worked at an AI startup that got acquired by Twitter and was offered a job to blog on the internet for 2 years by a bay area benefactor, which also got me my first O1 visa to come to the US. I’ve been a resident of San Francisco for 4 years and intend to continue residing in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future.\nThis is indeed my official pic from work, see it at retro.bio/team\nALT\nTo some people I’m most known as the blogger behind nintil.com, where I’ve written about all sorts of things for over a decade, from the economic history of the USSR to Alzheimer’s Disease to technological progress and metascience to AI risk. If my current life arc goes well, my next proudest achievement will be to have made a meaningful dent on human aging.\nValues\nWhat makes a person them? One could gesture at memories, the way they look, the things they like. Maybe people don’t really exist, if one has ripped deep from the Parfitian bong. I find some truth to the idea that people are to some extent their values. I definitely think so for myself: I identify with my values, the most stable part of who I am. What do you care about? How do you behave in the world? Here are my own\nTruth-seeking: I want to understand the world and those around me, including myself. This is probably the first value I ever consciously endorsed. My first answer to “what is the point of it all” was this, perhaps oddly as many people tend to reach for ‘happiness’, ‘understanding’.\nHonesty and transparency: I really try to only speak truths and to not decline questions about myself, my motivations, or my thoughts (unless there are concerns about other people’s privacy, promises I’ve made, NDAs, etc). I once stood in front of an audience exposed to arbitrary questions about what most would consider very personal matters and I answered them all.\nReliability: I do what I say. I keep my promises, am not late to things. I keep most of my tasks in my calendar and have good awareness of what’s happening and what has to happen next.\nIntegrity: I strive to be consistent in my actions across contexts. No matter what I’m doing, the same principles apply. If I’m being hypocritical I appreciate if I’m called out on it so I can be better aligned with what deep down I value.\nSelf-improvement: Though I’m pretty great, I believe I can be even better and I appreciate when others help me, even when I don’t ask for it. Unsolicited advice is hereby declared solicited!\nBenevolent perspective: Sometimes people make other people feel bad for a variety of reasons. I think people are, deep down, good. When they are not, they are mistaken in some or another way. This leads me to react with curiosity, pity, and sadness (accordingly, case by case) instead of anger and hate. I don’t always act like this for I too am a fallible human but I try! This doesn’t mean I’m naive about people. Some people can’t be trusted, they say one thing and do anther or are manipulative!\nPolitics: though I don’t think about politics that much in my day to day life, the labels libertarian, classical libertarian, or even anarchist of some flavor would fit me; you can read more in my blog about my views.\nWhat my life looks like\nI live in San Francisco and I really like the Bay Area. I don’t envision moving anywhere else, particularly as long as I work at my current job. If forced to choose another place (other than the Bay Area), that would be New York.\nI’m the Head of Theory at Retro Biosciences, a company that aims to extend healthy human lifespan by 10 years. I work on strategy and vision-setting for the whole company.\nSometimes after work I have time for some social occasions but I try to have those happening on the weekends. I have a car so nowhere in the bay feels too far.\nI go to sauna+cold plunge for ~2 hours every week to unwind and reset for the next week\nI go dancing often, either solo (ecstatic dance) or partnered (fusion dance typically). From time to time it is the case that I’m the first person starting a dance floor. I do contact improv from time to time and I wouldn’t be surprised if I get into tango at some point.\nFood remains a passion of mine, it truly is one of the existential joys in life! I like going for dinners and fine dining and occasionally cook. I started hosting dinners for friends this year and would want to host social gatherings in the future\nI am very social. There are people out there that probably think of me as their local Partiful dealer.\nI go to festivals sometimes; in 2024 I went to vibeclipse, vibecamp, and burning man\nBut I’m still an introvert at heart. I like staying in cozymaxxing, drinking tea and reading\nThis year I picked up meditation and circling and various attempts at embodiment practices. I haven’t jhana’d yet but trying!\nI do less travel than I used to but I could imagine getting back into it in the future. There is a world out there to explore!\nI work out at home. I started building a minigym in my room and would like to expand it if I had more space. Sometimes I go to more class-type workouts like Barry’s.\nI still read and write in my blog, but less than I used to. Now I do a lot of reading and writing at work so that need gets met there.\nIf I were to write a section like this 5 years ago I’d say that my life looks like working, going to nice restaurants, occasionally visiting European countries on the weekends, playing videogames, watching anime, reading, and writing in my blog and not feature much in terms of in person social activities. Maybe 5 years from now I’ll be making art, practicing BJJ, and starting my own company.\nPotential incompatibilities\nSome things that could lead to disagreements or conflicts\nI like order. Though I have gotten better at this, a space that’s messy and unkempt makes me feel bad and slightly judgmental towards whoever is responsible for that space in a “sigh ,don’t you like nice things, why are you letting entropy win, make things nice”.\nRelated to the above, as I want to keep my promises and commitments, sometimes I can’t be fully present if I know there’s something happening after the current activity. This comes handy at work (making sure a meeting doesn’t rabbithole pointlessly nor it skips agenda items) but it’s annoying when eg. cuddling (not having to think ‘have we cuddled for long enough?’ is nice). My solution to this is using timers.\nI can be stubborn sometimes. Often my view of the world is that I am right and everything I do is the correct action, with high confidence. But I also change my mind quickly. Truly strong beliefs, weakly held. I strive to not be too annoying about this. Fighting me is worth it though, as it will refine my understanding of a topic and eventually I do change my mind on things.\nMy curiosity about people can come across as judgmental. Whether you do something unusual or like vanilla ice cream, I might be asking questions of the type “why do you like that?” which can feel like I’m rejecting your experience or I’m wishing you to change. I know why I ask these questions and there is indeed a mixture of genuine curiosity and “I want you to change”\nSometimes I’m told I’m very “in my head” and “disembodied”. Trying to understand better what that means and be more of a being in the world at the moment.\nI get overwhelmed if I’m in a room with lots of conversations around me for long enough. “Wait but how are you in the top 0.1% of SF party enjoyers, you might ask” My current reconciliation of social events and this is to arrive exactly on time and leave once the noise is unbearable. So for me the peak forms of social hangouts are either small group conversations or ragers where there’s only dancing and music but not much talking.\nWhat I’m looking for\nThis is not a job description, take these as a broad direction, you don’t have to be perfect along all of these dimensions!\nAesthetics: I like nice things (art, fine dining, nicely decorated rooms, etc) and ideally you should too. But I don’t have enough taste as others do to make this happen for me. Help me make our lives beautiful, or let’s hire an interior designer to help us lol.\nGood self-aware communication. Someone that understands themselves deeply and is willing to extend that deep understanding to me. Let’s build little models of each other in our minds :)\nA growth partner: I see a relationship as something where we grow together. I’ll help you grow but won’t try to fix you and I expect you will do the same with me.\nA balanced way of being: You see the appeal of both cold and warm cultures, you can zoom into narrow problems and also take the high level view. Same for guess and ask cultures: you see the point of asking directly for what you want as well as looking out for what others might need.\nSomeone to do things together with: Anything in my list above, plus maybe something from your own list? Ultimately, with the right person, many activities can become enjoyable, from drinking tea and reading, assembling lego flowers together to going to burning man.\nMonogamish-to-poly: Reading Esther Perel left me convinced that pure monogamy is not for me (or people like me). When I think “will one person even be enough” part of me says yeah if they are the right person! Another part says probably not! But people change, and if I commit all-in to monogamy now (even with the right person) I see myself with a high enough risk of being unhappy in the future, tied by my values of honesty and commitment, so I want to leave that door open. You could be asymmetrically monogamous or you could be very poly, as long as we still are transparent with each other (per values above)\nKids. I am not yet sure if I want them. I am open to that, but not in the next 2 years. I expect I’ll end up wanting kids though.\nAssorted José facts\nI’m funny sometimes. I also say strange things that make sense at least to me. José Luis Ricón Fernández de la PuenteJosé Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente on Twitter / X​\nThere are a couple of podcasts where I yap about various topics of interest\nThe previous iteration of this date-me doc was featured in the NYT!\nI’m surprisingly good at table football (but I rarely have the chance to play)\nFor my 30th birthday I ran a small art exhibition of my greatest tweets at the SF Commons. Great cakes were procured. People don’t maxx out on good cakes enough.\nI was once invited to a conference in the US. As a visitor the TSA office asked me what brought me to the US. I said “to make science great again”. The officer lol’d and let me into the country.\nI might be the person about whom the most Manifold Markets have been made ManifoldHome​\nDiet: I eat animals sometimes (you don’t have to agree on this). That said, I don’t think one has to eat animals to be healthy, so I’m happy with being mostly vegetarian or vegan-ish at home, and spending my animal points on nicely cooked steak.\nPictures\nJose’s paella, known as SF’s best paella\nALT\nMe & my roommate Angie at the launch of Scout Dixon West’s perfumes.

      "fullText": "﻿Daniel Filan’s date-me doc\r\n  \r\nLast edited 2025-10-12, best viewed on desktop\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! I’m Daniel Filan! Here are some basic things about me:\r\n* Man\r\n* 5’8”, ~145 lb\r\n* Born March 1994\r\n* Berkeley, CA\r\n* Poly\r\nI’m looking for\r\n* A woman\r\n* … to (eventually) be in a committed relationship with\r\n* … that ideally leads to having kids.\r\nInterested? Email df@danielfilan.com, or reach out some other way (e.g. via twitter). Want to know more? Read on.\r\nWhat I’m like\r\nI work in the field of AI research—specifically, research that aims to reduce the chance that AI takes over the world. At the moment I’m helping run a research internship program, managing the interns and other people who manage the interns. I also make a podcast where I interview people in the field about their research.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, my main hobby is learning Latin. Other present and past hobbies include contra dancing, learning about the history of Christianity, and watching anime. I also try to do cardio exercise at least three times a week, and enjoy taking long walks (I recently walked 17 miles diagonally across San Francisco).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had to describe my general vibe, I would say that I’m academic-shaped. The thing I am best at is studying, and if I may flatter myself, I think I would make a good 60-year-old whose job was to be generally erudite and warm.\r\nTestimonials\r\nI’m bad at describing myself, so here are some friends’ descriptions of me:\r\n\r\n\r\nAsya Bergal (excerpts below, full testimonial here, bolding original):\r\nDaniel is very (intentionally) funny, at least to me and a lot of people whose sense of humor isn’t too far from mine. IMO the best thing about Daniel is a mixture of being generative, funny, and low-ego that reliably makes me joyful (often laughing) and at ease when I’m around him. I think he fosters this feeling to a really unusual extent among people I know, and I suspect the optimal long-term partner for   Daniel will be someone who really likes that feeling and wants to live in it forever.\r\n* [...] several individuals from different parts of my social network have unpromptedly expressed to me that they find Daniel very good to be around, including one who I think of as extremely judgmental and perceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEli Tyre:\r\nDaniel Filan is among the top 10 highest integrity people that I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:\r\nDaniel is interesting to talk to, he knows many things. I usually get a bit anxious around new people but did not feel that way when talking to Daniel - he seems nonjudgmental and is also occasionally funny :p\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Steidley:\r\nDaniel is a fantastically passionate guy. He’s always interested in some new topic and learning everything about it. He’s funny. He’s cheerful. He’s a delight. It’s extremely rare to find him in a bad mood. \r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel stands up for what he believes in, but also admits his mistakes quickly and completely. He’s terrifically smart.\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nAt a high level: intimate, reliable, and comfortable companionship that helps me grow in unexpected ways and can serve as a foundation for the rest of my life. But I think that’s pretty generic. So here are traits someone could have that I think predict I would get on well with them:\r\n* Being analytical\r\n* Being ambitious but also (at least somewhat) pro-social\r\n* Being curious and open-minded\r\n* Favouring bluntness and honesty, while trying to maintain tact\r\nCompatibility\r\nHere are some things about me that will maybe help you predict whether we’re compatible. Note that apart from location + children, these aren’t asks of you, they’re facts about me.\r\n* As mentioned above, I think I want kids. I’m not dead set on them, but they seem pretty cool, and in general I’ve observed that my positive affect towards babies and children has grown a lot in the past 5 or so years.\r\n* I live in the SF Bay Area. Moving for a relationship is not totally out of the question, but the bar for doing so is quite high.\r\n* I’m currently in a polyamorous relationship that I like with someone who is not currently interested in having children. Due to wanting children, I’m looking for another partner to be in a primary/committed role with.\r\n   * I don’t have much experience with polyamory, and so don’t feel very settled in a poly ‘style’ and could imagine changing what I want things to look like.\r\n* I’m asexual. I enjoy physical contact, but having sex doesn’t feel desirable to me.\r\n* I’m vegan, and disapprove of the consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy. I’m OK with being close with people who aren’t vegan, but I could imagine tension about how to raise any children, or if you think that non-human animal welfare obviously doesn’t matter.\r\n* I don’t really drink alcohol or take other recreational intoxicants (which is to say: I do such things less than once a month, but not never).\r\n* I am very politically libertarian.\r\n* I’m active in the LessWrong and Effective Altruism communities, altho I would say I’m more of a LessWronger than an Effective Altruist.\r\n* I sneeze extremely loudly—loud enough that I have one friend who is genuinely seriously bothered by it (but not so loud that I have more than one such friend (well, as far as I know)).\r\n   * If you don’t have misophonia, I think this will probably not be a deal-breaker.\r\n* I don’t believe in God. I’m interested in the phenomenon of religion, but don’t recommend practicing it.\r\nMore photos of me\r\n  \r\n I am normal and can be trusted with babies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n‘Fun’ facts about me\r\n* I grew up in Australia. My accent is predominantly general American, but retains a few Australian characteristics (e.g. the way I say “no”).\r\n* The caption on the previous page, while funny, is literally true: I am extremely bad at purposely smiling in photos.\r\n   * I’ve been told that when I smile in real life, I smile like Keira Knightley.\r\n* I can, in my head, approximately calculate the factorials of large numbers, but it takes me an unimpressive amount of time.\r\n   * You can too by memorizing Stirling’s approximation and a few base-ten logarithms.\r\n* Wiktionary uses a sentence I originally wrote (but did not add there) to illustrate the use of the word “scrutable”.\r\n* I came up with what I believe is the worst unparalleled misalignment yet found—specifically, it was used by the creator of the art form as an example of the epitome of un-funniness and torturedness.\r\n   * It’s Los Angeles // newspaper comics.\r\n* The reason I got around to actually writing this date me doc is that I told someone I would pay them $200 if I didn’t publish one by a certain date. The reason I did that is that I told the same person I would pay them $100 if, by a certain date, I didn’t arrange to make a deal to pay them >$100 if I didn’t publish a date-me doc by a     certain date."

      "fullText": "hello! – hussein.love\nhussein.love\ndate me!\nabout me\nabout my cat\nmoodboard\nHi, I’m Hussein 👋\nI’m 38, 5’8”, bi, and in pretty good physical shape (the best of my life!). I live in Brooklyn, NYC. I’m playful, reflective, and caring; I’m Uncle Hussein and godparent to two kids I love, I have an amazing cat, I do community work, etc; just a normal, stand-up guy with zero skeletons in the closet and absolutely no aspirations to start a personality cult or anything weird like that.\nThe sort of person I am\nOn bad days I think I’m a good person because I’m funny and clever.\nOn good days I think I’m a good person because I’m open-hearted, playful, and kind.\nOn the best days I don’t think about whether I’m a good person at all.\nI recently combined a list of goals and the things I like to do, and they seemed to fall into four values: connection, curiosity, beauty, and vitality.\nIf you are sick I will make soup and bring it to you. It’s an important way I show love.\nSome things I like to do:\nDance, in particular 5Rhythms (free movement / expressive / ecstatic dance);\nOutdoorsy / light-active stuff: climbing, walking, fair-weather sailing, easy cycling (no lycra);\nGrow food - I built raised beds in my garden, and love the fresh tomatoes I get from it;\nDIY and making stuff - I’ve made plenty of the things in my house, including furniture and drapery;\nCooking, restaurants, cocktails (though I rarely drink these days);\nAny classical music concert featuring an angsty Russian Romantic composer;\nI worked in tech for 15+ years and one thing it is easy to do is separate oneself from people unlike you. To work and live and play in communities of people very similar to you, or to have the “diversity” you experience look like skin color and sexuality and gender id but not wealth or class or education. It is deeply, vitally important to me to\nnot\ndo this, to stay connected to and in touch and aware of the way others live. We may be better off but we are not better. I will not separate myself from humanity.\nMy vice is hookah. If I had one at home I’d instantly die of lung cancer, so I don’t. But I keep finding that the best people I know are down to go to a hookah bar. Doesn’t have to be you, but it’s an easy way to get a 🤩 face from me.\nI want one of these. This one is someone else's, but I love her anyway.\nThe sort of future I want\nI believe a life of weeping-with-happiness contentment is possible, and I want it.\n[Update: since writing that, I have wept with happiness.]\nI would like to co-create a life - location, partner, friends, community (which I see as another word for “family”) - at a more sustainable pace, where exploration and flourishing is nurtured. I value making sure people are fed: I’ve volunteered making meals for chronically sick people, and also helped run a mutual aid food drive for two years. I want to spend more of my time tackling food insecurity and I’ve got Big Plans to do so.\nI’ve still got more travelling in me: more time in Japan, interior China, a return to Istanbul, and Iran are all on my bucket list. I seem to be converging on India from both directions.\nSomeone giving me feedback on this page once told me I come across as having main character energy. It’s true! And I’m looking for a co-star: someone who burns brightly, knows it, and wants to be with me because they love my light; a relationship where we reinforce and lift each other, ever-growing.\nI think I’d make an amazing trophy husband, which is only a joke if you’re not rich.\nI want children, and I want to be active in raising them. I grew up in London and miss it enormously, but it’s not time for me to move back\nyet\n; but I do think it’d be a wonderful place to live it’s time for me to trade my main character energy into being a supporting character in my kids’ lives. If we get serious, expect me to seriously float this idea. In the meantime, I’ll be back for regular visits: London is a place where I breathe out, find ease and peace.\nSpirituality\nI used to be allergic to the word until a friend pointed out “dude, you have a spirit, it’s the thing that makes you you”, and then I was fine.\nThe condensed version of my spiritual biography: I grew up Muslim, but quit in my early twenties because I felt like I couldn’t do it well enough. I came close to falling down the New Atheism rabbithole, but dodged it; in my late twenties I began a quest for capital-M Meaning, which I finally found after lots of therapy and years of Zen practice.\nBuddhism has been important to me for approaching a decade. Buddhist philosophy and psychology is very much a part of who I am, how I think, and how I like to relate to the world. An example: when getting US citizenship, I asked for a waiver to the Oath of Allegiance on the grounds of not wanting to support the military, even though being 38 means there’s basically no chance I’ll get drafted.\nIt’s important to me that my partner has their own self-development practice - something that helps them be freer, kinder, and more open. It by no means has to be Buddhist flavoured.\nPotential dealbreakers\nI’m happy to talk about any of these if you’d like to know more.\nI would like to have children (at least one), preferably biological.\nThe kind of relationship I want is rock-solid: lots of communication, exquisite attunement. I think such a relationship could unfold into something monogam\nish\n: if there is nothing that can threaten the relationship, there’s room for fun and sparkles. But to say that the relationship needs to feel very secure first is an understatement; getting that right is the only priority.\nI pair better with someone who also has good executive function skills. Being able to trust a partner to get things done makes me feel taken care of, and gives me a profound feeling of relief and safety.\nI am politically far to the left. That said, I have largely disengaged with US politics and treat it solely as a spectacle. These days I am more of an anarchist, by which I mean I believe that community building and mutual aid is worthwhile and morally necessary.\nIf you think Israel’s occupation and treatment of Palestine is in any way conscionable or justifiable, I am not the person for you.\nI’m an only child, and have minimal to no contact with both of my parents. My family is thus entirely chosen. If you’re close to yours, I would love to become part of it.\nI have\na (really, really, really amazing) cat\n. If you viscerally hate cats, or have overwhelming allergies, that’d make it hard.\nI am vegetarian, with very occasional and intentional exceptions. I don’t mind whether you are or not. I do enjoy cooking, and will want to cook for you, so if you’ll feel slighted by me not putting meat on your plate then… eh, I dunno.\nWhat next?\nThis is the end of the text-heavy part. Thank you for sticking around!\nThere are a few places you can go from here:\nLook at\npictures of my cat\nLook at\nan assortment of pictures and videos from my life\nIf you’re interested, or have something to say, email me:\nhello@thiswebsite\nThanks, and I hope you find what you’re looking for too. ❤\n[back to top]\nMade with\nGitHub Pages\nand\nReverie"

Now, I’m a research scientist on\nGoogle DeepMind’s\nscalable alignment team in San Francisco. In this document, I’ll overview what the intervening time has made of me, as a person.\nI’m hoping to meet a wonderful woman to be\nmy best fr\niend\nfor many years.\n(And by “best friend”, I mean “wife.”)\nAbout me\nI’m kind, conscientious, and ready to admit mistakes—maybe I’m\ntoo\nready, to be honest! Speaking of “honest”, I’m also an extremely honest person. I haven’t always lived as ethically or as honestly as I would now have preferred, and I’m surely going to make more mistakes, but\ngod damn\nif I’m not going to live this one life well.\nI am pretty goofy if I trust and feel comfy around someone. I think I’d jive well with someone more spontaneous and daring, since I tend to be more planned and conservative. Well, I’m\nusually\nmore conservative:\nIf I make a commitment to you, I keep it, and I’m not particularly afraid of commitments. I’m someone you can rely on.\n1\nOne of my friends described me as “not the kind of person who will put up with [unethical] conspiracies.”\nAt my thesis defense in 2022.\nOn the other hand, I do love a good\nethical\nconspiracy. I once hatched an elaborate “welcome back” party for a partner who was coming back from overseas. I rounded up 18 of her friends and hid them in my apartment so they could all jump out at her.\nProfessional life\nI’m hard-working. In 2017, in the second year of\nmy computer science\nPhD,\nI found out about the\nAI alignment prob\nlem.\nHowever, I lacked the skills to contribute to this hilariously neglected super-problem. That lack didn’t really matter to me—I thought that the world needed something from me, and I wasn’t going to\nnot even try\n.\nI might not be good at something at first, but I don’t quit! In the second year of my PhD I wasn’t comfortable proving mathematical theorems. By the end of my fourth year, I had proved 281 new theorems.\nPersonal life\nHawaiian waterfalls! 🏝️\nThat said, I’ve become a bit less research-focused recently. Somewhat relatedly, I’d become somewhat more anxious than I’d like. At the end of 2023, I realized that I just… wasn’t enjoying my life? Since then, I’ve focused on meditation, intentionality, gratitude, and actually taking breaks.\nWhen I was younger, I wasn’t social. These days, I love meeting new people! I’m an\nambivert\n: sometimes socializing is energizing, but sometimes it’s draining. I have a lot of friends who are precious to me, and I wish I could give each of them the time they each deserve. Sometimes I even look out over a city and wonder at the residents:\nPart of me wishes I could meet and deeply understand each and every person here. Each pinpoint of light is shining for a\nreason\n, it was put there\nby another person\n.\nSo, I care a lot about people—both in the abstract and personally. I’ve never yelled at anyone in my life (except, you know, I probably did as a young kid, but I don’t remember that well).  I’m also a vegan who cares about animals.\nWhat I like doing\nI like doing a lot of things!\nDancing\nI like salsa and waltz. I’m learning West Coast Swing. I can vibe with almost anything, though!\nAI-fueled house parties\nI like bringing a ton of my friends together in my\n2br\napartment. To commemorate such an occasion, I personalize a name tag for each of them! The tag has their name and then a picture of them. Only, the picture is tailored to the theme of the party:\nThe\ngigachad\nhouse party\n: MidJourney v3 interpolating my image with gigachad’s in order to create a “gigachad Alex” to go on the name tag.\n(a) Alex\n(b) Gigachad\n(c) Gigachad Alex\nThe\nhouse\nhouse party\n: Each of my friends has their own spirit and vibe! I made them houses which capture their\nessences\n.\n(a) Tolkienesque\n(b) Grimdark\n(c) Mario\nDesign & art\nI\ndesigned this webs\nite,\nfor example!\nWhile I don’t draw anymore, I’ve really gone through phases here! For example, in order to communicate research insights which were dear to me, I wrote and illustrated a series of blog posts called\nReframing Imp\nact:\nWriting\nMeditation\nI used to say “no, isn’t this just learning how to wirehead and evoke fake happiness for no reason?”. Then I got really, really sad, so I said “screw it.” I made the right choice, though I’m still not particularly skilled.\nReading textbooks\nYes\nthis\nis\na\nreal\nt\nhing\nI\ndo\nfor\nfun\nsometi\nmes.\nHow compatible are we?\nPossible dealbreakers\nI probably (70%) will want kids within the next 5 years.\nI’ve historically been polyamorous but I’m open to monogamy. I find it natural to form romantic attachments with multiple people and am not very jealous. I talk regularly with my former partner Emma—I want my friendship with her to stay strong.\nI currently live in Berkeley. I’m open to (but disprefer) a long-distance relationship if there’s a good chance we end up in the same location, assuming the relationship is great! In particular, cities like New York and London are more workable (as DeepMind has offices there I could work out of).\nWhat I’m like in a relationship\nI’m a positive presence. When my friends self-deprecate, I often scold them for insulting my friend (i.e. themselves).\nAs of November 2024, my\nattachment s\ntyle\nleans “anxious-preoccupied.” However, over the past few years, my style was “secure.” I find it easy to date anxious folks because I like supporting my partners through reassurance and praise.\nMy\nlove lang\nuage\nis “quality time” and “physical touch”, closely followed by “words of affirmation.” I want to find a life\npartner\n—a mutually supportive and committed relationship. I want to do things together.\nWhat I appreciate in a partner\nThis isn’t a list of\ndemands\nor anything, just ingredients for a good relationship with me:\nTrustworthiness, high empathy, and emotional maturity\nIntellect / wits / sharpness\nWe can talk for hours about nothing\nConfidence is hot\nBeing good at\nstem\nis also hot\nNon-avoidant attachment style\nThe kind of girl\n2\nwho would have refused to obey in\nthe Milgram experi\nment\nSpontaneous and medium-adventurous, but not to the point where you’re trying to backflip out of a plane while naked even though it’s 10:30 p.m. and we have an early morning the next day…\nSome dispositional\nje ne sais quoi\nwhich makes me feel at ease.\nIf this sounds like a nice potential connection, I’d love to:\nTake you dancing\n, or\nSpend a lazy Sunday morning watching the stream run by the\nHidden Café,\nor\nHave a sunset picnic and eat blueberries.\nThis could be us!\nOK, I’ve written enough! Get to know me if you want to know more.\nLet’s get in touch?\n☙\n❧\nFootnotes\nI mean, I’m not\nperfectly\nreliable. I’m just a hum—I mean, I’m just a trout! For example, there recently was a situation where I may have simply forgotten what someone had requested two years prior. But I think I am overall highly reliable—both in terms of faithfulness and in terms of logistics.\n⤴\nAka\n, ethical in the “I’ll actually stand up in real life” way and not just ethical in the “I’ll talk for hours about the nature of goodness” way.\n⤴"

A connection wherein both parties are committed to growth and practicing the art of love on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have periodically taken career breaks to globe-trot and spend time in awe-inspiring natural landscapes; and would love to continue to do so with my mate. This would require that you be in a similarly financially stable position as me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you give my brain a boner, the rest of my body can follow. Hit me up if you wanna skip the small talk[2] in favor of meaningful conversations on the trail, at the beach, or in bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour character matters to me. Your height genuinely doesn’t.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact Me\r\nIf you’re thinking to yourself, “I bet the most direct way to get into her pants is by filling out a form,” then you’re damn right.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could probably beat you at\r\nPun competitions\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 things I could never do without\r\n1. Snuggles! Preferably with humans and doggos, but a highly affectionate cat will do in a pinch 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nIf I were a cephalopod, I'd be a cuddle-fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Feeling wonderment and smallness in gorgeous natural settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Vegan meals. A way to my heart and other parts is through my belly. (You don’t necessarily have to be vegan yourself, though.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Laughing so hard it starts to hurt, and inducing said laughter in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy underground improv performance at BART Basel\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The pursuit of self-improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The type of intimate connection wherein one feels fully seen, valued, appreciated, held, and empowered to become the best version of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing people notice about me\r\nI’m a total nerd. And a total dork. And totally love it.\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can call me Babe-raham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nA day in our life\r\nNote: While this is cribbed from my days right now, I'm very much interested in collaborating with my partner, and would love your input on what you'd like our life together to look like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaking up to you caressing my body. Time and space seem to disappear as our bodies entwine; there’s only us; our souls dancing together in the ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an ongoing competition between us of who can make the other laugh harder. I thought I'd already defeated you before we even started making breakfast, but by the end of the meal we’re clearly tied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopping in the car to hit the trailhead. You start playing a lecture from one of The Great Courses, and I periodically pause the recording to discuss what we’re learning together.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting up with our friends for a hike through a beautiful location. You’ve brought gloves for everyone so we can pick up litter we spot along the trail. We take goofy pictures. The group conversations alternate between being silly/funny and profound/vulnerable/informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining our friends for an epic post-hike meal. Food always tastes better when shared and after your body has worked for it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHeading home for a quick rinse/make out session in the shower before we split up to do our own thing for the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nI eventually head back into our bedroom for my nightly wind-down ritual of putting my phone to bed, silently reading, writing in my journal, meditating, brushing my teeth, and changing into cozy pajamas.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually you wrap up whatever cool thing you were doing and crawl into bed as well, and we snuggle while exchanging gratitudes and setting intentions for the next day. As we drift off to sleep our limbs are once again interdigitated, and the world feels like a calm and serene and lovely place.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I could also be open to a polyamorous lifestyle, but am not looking to date poly men who already have primary partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Let's instead talk about: relationship goals, commitments, how to better the world, passions, philosophies, lies we’ve told, science, psychology, the quantified self, enlightenment, paradoxes, projects we could work on together, embarrassing stories, epiphanies, bucket list items, lessons learned from previous relationships and other experiences, patriarchy, your personal definition of \"god\", economics, culture, why you're optimistic about the future, hermeneutics, animal intelligence, history, escaping the rat race, traditions, the most impactful book you've ever read, role models, habits, the awe of the cosmos, the awe of humanity’s place within the cosmos, rituals, friendships, altered states, sexuality, what makes you want to jump out of bed in the morning and take on the day, consciousness, social cohesion, anything in my profile, anything in your profile, and whatever else fascinates us."

      "fullText": "﻿Date Charlie  \r\nHey, thanks for stopping by! I’m Charlie, and I’m looking for a deep connection with a man, hopefully in the Bay Area, with an eye to finding my life partner. If you’re interested, please reach out! You can message me, get a mutual friend to intro us, email me, or use this link. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nI come across as perceptive, caring, attuned, ambitious, and sincere. \r\nHere’s how some of my friends describe me:\r\nSasha Chapin: “I think of Charlie as a graceful mover, both in physical space and in conversational space — he is a striking presence that improves the energy of a room.”\r\nCatherio: “Perceptive, caring, attuned.”\r\nMax Heitmann (ex-bf): “Charlie is his own person, probably the most himself of anyone I know. That person is sincere, curious, determined, and loving.”\r\nNora Ammann: “Charlie is thoughtful, caring and attuned, as well as spirited, curious and courageous. He is a good and loyal friend.”\r\nJohn Salvatier: “Unrelentingly present.”\r\n  \r\n\r\nRelationship style\r\nI lean monogamous, though I have a few years of experience with poly / open relationships, which I’m open to exploring with the right person. I think I’ll want children in the future, but likely not within the next 5 years.\r\nInterests\r\nI spend a significant part of my life on self-discovery, introspecting, and deepening my relationships with others. I did some Serious Meditation a few years back, and had some profound experiences. I now spend a good chunk of my time on relational practices—which often looks like having very present, authentic, conversations. Relational practices bring more truth and love to my relationships and my self-expression, and nourish me massively. \r\n  \r\n\r\nI like running events! I host dance parties and run regular relational practices; I’ve run a Relateful (circling) immersion with Jordan Allen, a Coherence Psychology retreat with Malcolm Ocean, and many CFAR and CFAR-adjacent workshops. \r\nBesides that, I love to dance west coast swing (see me dancing here), lift heavy things with perfect form (see me lifting here), hang out with my friends’ kids, and cry at Jacob Collier videos.\r\nCareer stuff: I’m Chief of Staff at Palisade Research, where we’re trying to build awareness of AI risks among policymakers. Previously, I worked as an instructor for the Center For Applied Rationality. And before that, I did a master’s at Oxford, and developed Bayesian ML models to estimate the effectiveness of interventions against COVID. Tyler Cowen described my paper as ‘The best mask-wearing study so far?’.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nI’m usually more attracted to people who are more:\r\n* Emotionally attuned: You’re in touch with yourself and listen deeply to others. You care a lot about communicating authentically.\r\n* Vibrantly interested in stuff: You’re intellectually lively, sharp/analytical, and curious. \r\n* Extroverted / energetic.\r\n* Playful!\r\n* Grounded: You’re steady in yourself, and in touch with your masculine energy.\r\n* Cute / sweet.\r\nAbout us\r\nSpending time with each other nourishes us, brings us closer to ourselves, and reminds us what life is about. \r\nI’d be especially happy if our relationship had:\r\n* Deep listening. Over time, we come to know each other, and how we relate to one another, more and more deeply. \r\n* Alive, attuned, and perhaps wildly kinky, sex (I’m switch). Also, attuned touch; cuddling.\r\n* We’re entangled with what matters most to each of us. We mutually support each other’s interests, and sometimes even participate / collaborate / build together.\r\n* Fun: We go on adventures, nature or otherwise. We share music. We dance together, messy and silly, gentle and sensual. We play. We laugh lots. We cuddle up with an excellent movie or a trashy TV show.\r\nIf you’re interested, please reach out! You can message me, get a mutual friend to intro us, email me, or use this link."

Someone who is kind, intelligent, silly, curious, courageous, and empathetic. And very importantly, someone who is emotionally mature enough to realize the kind of work and sacrifices that a relationship entails.\nI am pretty flexible about the actual location, since my job is usually remote. Buttt I am a sucker for good weather - I’ve lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and in Malaga, Spain for a little bit so I am not going to pretend that living in Norway would be perfect for me. But love transcends all, right? 😛 I’ll try to use some of the existing fields in this template that I find are surprisingly appropriate or just funny.\nGoals\nIdeally - find someone who is compatible with me in a relationship sense by showing them this document and some pictures of me, at which point they will fall hopelessly in love.\nNon-goals\nMeeting more guys. Just kidding! If you think we would be two cubes in an ice tray, regardless of what your gender is, then totally message me and we can haaanggg. See “Implementation and Rollout Plan” for contact details.\nProposed solution\nMeet a lot more girls with the openness to a relationship or just a friendship depending on how we feel about each other. I see either as a win, but I want to be clear that my intention going into a meeting is 80% to date and 20% to be friends. To be clear, I love having a relationship that has the foundation of a friendship. But I am not sure how this is possible unless we read this doc, signed a binding contract to be friends, erased our memories, and then one day felt that we could be more.\nI think it’s easier going from “Ah I don’t see this working out as a relationship, but we can totally drink boba like every 5 weeks” rather than “Hey we drink boba like every 5 weeks, but I want to see you again tomorrow.”\nInterests and Hobbies\nProgramming - I am a software engineer who has worked for blockchain companies (trading and gaming-related) and I am extremely grateful that I truly enjoy my work! I love building things with an end customer in mind and I find it awesome that solving cool problems can make peoples’ lives better. Somehow, I think the universe was beautifully designed that way.\nMath/Physics\nI kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world\nI have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation\nI used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\nStrategy Games\nReally Like\nCatan (I love the 1v1 version of Colonist, I was ranked Diamond two seasons ago and btw the username is from Looking for Alaska by John Green haha)\nSecret Hitler\nSoccer\nLove/Hate\nChess\nTennis (love watching it though)\nHate\nUno (is this even strategy?)\nLosing (in honesty, I can get pretty competitive sometimes haha)\nBeing active\nRunning\nSwimming Way Too Deep in the Ocean (SWTDO)\nRowing\nComedy\nImprov (for me, humor compatibility in a relationship is huge and if I can do a bit with you, that is a huge plus)\nConan O’Brien <3\nValues\nHonesty\nI am the kind of person who tries to say what is on his mind in a compassionate, caring way towards myself and others\nI think short-term discomfort is worth long-term growth\nI really resonate with the quote from the Kite Runner, “That's the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.” It just means to me that if we both trust ourselves to be honest, we can assume good intention and it just makes things soooooo much easier (and we can also move much faster haha!)\nGentleness/Kindness\nI don’t feel like a man needs to be “assertive” or “dominant”; I think being gentle and kind is strong in it’s own way\nI think being kind and loving and holding someone’s heart with care are so much more important and I want to be with someone who values the care I give to them\nFighting Well\nI think in a relationship fights are inevitable, but I think healthy relationships fight well\nPhysical violence is not okay, as are demeaning comments\nWe try to argue our points to the best of our knowledge and acknowledge good points from the other side\nWe are both mentally healthy enough that we do our best to make it work but have the power to walk away at any time\nHealth\nI have become much healthier over the last 7 or 8 years and I would love to meet someone who also cares about what they put in their body\nI love to exercise on a regular basis, whether it is swimming, running, rowing, or playing soccer\nI don’t expect my partner to be interested in the same activities (I guess this goes for really everything I’ve said so far haha)\nAlso pretty into meditation, although my view on its importance has changed a lot over the past few years\nSelfish Altruism with a Mix of Loving Without Expectation\nI think it is important to figure out what brings you joy and how you can use that to bring joy to others\nBare altruism is rarely a good long-term goal - how many vegetarians/vegans have you met who did it for the sake of the world but gave up because of how futile they felt their attempts were in making a dent in the animal consumption problem?\nFor me, becoming almost fully vegetarian/vegan was a decision inspired by my getting healthier and looking better\nBut I think loving yourself allows you to love others best :); and loving without expectation is the best way to show up in life and in a relationship - that love doesn’t have any promises; you just have to be grateful for every moment, and enjoy every single moment\nCuriosity/Playfulness\nI love being just fun and silly and weird and my humor can be dirty sometimes with people I feel comfortable with, and I hope to find someone I can play with for the rest of my life\nI think that the universe is somehow inherently playful - it does without any purpose and it rewards joy and spreading happiness\nI think everything is connected from chess to physics to swimming to flowers and I love to find and think about these connections\nBelief/Confidence/Ambition\nI truly believe that the universe works with you on goals you really believe in and that the universe responds when you ask it for something and put a full-hearted effort into it\nI think working towards goals that ignite us is what we live for and it’s important to me that my partner is decently ambitious as well\nPhysical Connection\nPhysical touch is one of my love languages, so I would ideally like to be with someone who also likes that :)\nI think sex to me is a part of expressing love in a relationship, and while it shouldn’t be at the forefront of what’s going on, I think it’s important that there is good physical compatibility\nI don’t think about sex that much at all, unfortunately, so I can tend to be bad at initiating; however, this is something I am happy to work on\nPictures\nAnd here are some (silly) pictures of me! I guess if I had to describe myself, I am a 5’ 10.5’’ guy who tends to be kind of skinnier/toned side. A lot of these are in Europe (I lived in Spain for a bit last year!) and I switch a lot between having and not having a beard, so I’ll include pictures of both 🙂\nI didn’t even get to go to the top :,) But maybe we can?\nALT\nYeah I guess you could say I get a lot of kudos\nALT\nWhat’s up with my posture lmao\nALT\nDon’t show this to my mom (I’m a momma’s boy if you couldn’t tell)\nALT\nJust for balance, a picture my mom probably likes\nALT\nSuccess Criteria\nHow will you validate the solution is working correctly?\nHopefully, we can be very open with each other if we think things are working out. I am sometimes really good but otherwise hopelessly lost in reading signs from girls.\nI also don’t want to waste either of our time - I think a relationship is an opportunity cost and I hope that we are both gaining something from our time together to make up for it.\nWhat monitoring and alerting will you do to ensure this project doesn’t decrease performance and reliability?\nI will constantly ask ChatGPT 4.5 to tell me what I am doing wrong\nImplementation and rollout plan\nIf you read all that and you think you still want to meet me, I guess maybe you’re pretty cool yourself.\nHaha, did you actually fall for this big pile of steaming …? Okay sorry, like I said my humor can be a bit strange sometimes. Hopefully, you didn’t actually stop reading. Or if everyone stopped reading, would anyone ever read this? I wonder if I could just write whatever I wanted down here. Like YO MAMMA IS SO FAT, THAT SHE GOES THROUGH A LUNAR CYCLE EVERY TIME SHE PIROUETTES. Who said my jokes were good?\nJeez, okay… I will try to be serious for like 20 seconds. If you think we would be a good fit, text me at (plus one) five one zero, seven seven one, four nine one four. Or email me at kaushikdr@gmail.com. Or do both?"

His work bridges cutting-edge machine vision and deep learning techniques with practical applications in health, such as the development of generative models for\ndigital pathology. Carson's work has spanned basic research in the cognitive neuroscience of human vision, the neuroscience of Buddhist meditative states,\nand many practical applications of machine learning to diagnostic healthcare problems. His research is driven by a desire to improve human health, happiness, and flourishing, whether mental or physical.\nHe believes in driving forward practical technologies while sharing and publishing relevant scientific findings with the world.\nCarson has a long-running interest in Mysticism, and believes that there\nis not such a difference between the tools we think of as \"therapeutic\",\nand millenia-old mystical traditions such as Buddhism and Daoism. A culture,\nsuch as ours, which is overly materialistic and has lost touch with the subjective,\nthe natural, and the ritualistic, is at risk of collapsing under its own weight.\nCarson hopes that his teaching, writing, and research will help bridge this divide,\nand make esoteric mysticism more legible to the rationally-minded scientist.\nWe rarely hear the inner music, but we are all dancing to it nonetheless.\n- Rumi\nPlease do reach out if you are interested in research collaboration, coaching, or consultation!\nResearch and Teaching\nI have two Neuroscience degrees (Caltech BA 2013, UC Berkeley Masters 2019). I have also worked as a\nresearcher and Data Scientist at Google Machine Intelligence, YouTube, and Verily Life Sciences. My research interests span medical imaging, neuroscience, machine intelligence, and Dharma science.\nGoogle Scholar profile\nLinkedIn profile\nResearch Tools\nUltrasound Neuroimaging\nAt Forest Neurotech, we are developing a device that can image and modulate functional activity\nin the human brain cheaply, portably, and minimally-invasively.\nWe hope this technology will be used to treat a wide range of conditions from\ndepression to addiction\n,\nas well as brain-machine interfacing\nand neuroscience research.\nAutofluorescence Microscopy\nWhile at Verily, I worked on the\nVirtual Stainer\nproject. We used generative learning to predict histological stains from autofluorescence scans of unstained tissue. See\n(McNeil et al., 2024)\n, in Modern Pathology, and other publications.\nMedical Image Embedding\nI worked on a project to use Masked-Siamese Networks to embed colonscopy videos in a semi-supervised way. See\n(Shor, McNeil et al., 2024)\nFunctional Neuroanatomy\nWhile at Berkeley, I was in the\nGallant Lab\nwithin the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research org, working on fMRI research projects to model the human visual system.\nHuman Emotion\nWhile at Google Machine Intelligence, I kicked off a collaboration between Google and Berkeley to study emotion in human faces using DNNs. 5 years later, this collaboration produced\n(Cowen et al. 2021)\nin Nature. I have an ongoing interest in emotion and mental health.\nDrugs and the Brain\nWhile at Berkeley, I taught the course\nDrugs and the Brain\nunder\nProf. David Presti\n. At Caltech, I taught a class of the same name under\nProf. Henry Lester\n. Psychedelics, as a therepeutic, spiritual, and investigative tool remain of interest to me.\nCreative Content\nScienctific work is creative work. But I have also produced a lot of more casual content.\nSubstack Essays\nMedium Essays (will move to Substack)\nYouTube Channel\nYouTube Lectures\nI have several long-form talks on psycho-spiritual frameworks on my\nYouTube Channel\n. These were given at a private event, and due to popular acclaim, I posted them online. Perhaps more on this theme will follow.\nEssays\nI write essays sometimes, which I post to my\nSubstack\n. The topics range between philosophy, poetic, light research projects, and psychology. For example:\nPolyamory doesn't Liberate; Monogamy doesn't Protect by Carson\nReflections and community quotes from a decade in the Bay Area dating landscape.\nRead on Substack\nWedding Ritual Design for a Pluralistic Society by Carson\nA recollection of, and guide to, hand-crafting a syncretic, modern, and personal wedding ceremony.\nRead on Substack\nFlirtations with Death by Carson\nNecro-posting an old note from my Medium with some extra explication on the macabre.\nRead on Substack\nADHD: Steroids, The Gym, and The Game  by Carson\nThe Game is changing, and this is twice as true on college campuses, where the amphetamine black market is booming … Given my own experience and that of friends, I was surprised to see the positive effects [of meditation] were so mild, until I saw the meditation protocols. … Would you go to the gym for 5 minutes a day and expect any sort of change?\nRead on Substack\nContact\nThis contact form will send to a tagged place in my email, where I am likely to see and respond to it.\n- Subject -\nResearch Collaboration\nConsulting\nCoaching\nOther\nSend Message\n© Carson McNeil.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply."

      "fullText": "﻿EDIT: as of late 2024, I’ve found my life partner. We’re in a non-monogamous relationship, so you can still fill in the form below or reach out directly if you might be interested in a flirtation or fling. I’ve left the rest of this doc unedited from the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nI very much want a life partner who orients towards the world in a similar way as I do. I’m writing this document in the hope of finding her; please share it with women you think might be a good match. I’m male, 30, living in San Francisco, working in AI. Whether or not I have kids will depend on my partner (see section on that below). I’m open to going on dates with people who live elsewhere, but have trouble seeing myself living outside a major global city in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are five of my defining traits; I’d love to find a partner who shares them with me. If they resonate with you, fill in this form or reach out directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth\r\n* I think of the world as full of opportunities waiting to be seized - which even if we can’t get to yet, we’ll be able to tomorrow. I want to be with someone who sees themselves as a work in progress, like I am; and whose default attitude is \"why not?\"\r\n\r\nFor me, growth mindset is closely entangled with the idea of making the future of technology go well, which is the focus of most of my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectualism\r\n* It's most natural for me to relate to the world in an analytical, systematizing way. I'd love to have a partner who, like me, is strongly driven to understand what’s going on around them, to grasp the intellectual edifice humanity has been building, and to fill in the gaps themselves - not just in academic domains, but anywhere their curiosity leads them. For a picture of what this looks like in me, try reading my blog or my twitter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI often get along particularly well with people who read a lot as children, like I did. \r\n\r\n\r\nTeamwork\r\n* I want a relationship which is deeply cooperative: two people building something in collaboration, where strong communication is the default and we trust that we can handle problems together. Some examples of how I’ve worked towards this in previous relationships:\r\n   1. Scheduling an hour each week to raise issues and possible improvements.\r\n   2. Taking a course on non-violent communication together.\r\n   3. Doing circling together.\r\n\r\n\r\nRereading that list, it all sounds… kinda serious? But the spirit I’m pointing towards is much less so: if we can laugh at all sorts of things (including ourselves) together, we’re most of the way towards being a good team. And for me, being a good team is the essence of romance - everything else is built on top of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowardsness\r\n* By “towardsness” I mean being motivated by actively wanting to move towards desirable outcomes, rather than just away from undesirable outcomes. The latter typically comes from fear-based motivation (as I write about at length here). I think fear-based motivation is far more extensive than most people typically recognize, and that excitement-based motivation which actually focuses on moving towards goals is a kind of superpower.\r\n\r\nI previously formulated this point as a desire for a partner with prosocial motivations. But I now tend to think that overcoming fear (in particular deeply-rooted fear) is the main bottleneck to that, and that almost everyone would have pretty prosocial motivations if they were more emotionally integrated. And so I’m not really looking for a partner who cares deeply about any specific thing; I’m looking for a partner with the capacity to care deeply at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayfulness\r\n   * I balance the more serious traits above with an irreverent attitude towards life. I like spontaneous adventures, I like starting dancefloors, and I like thinking of rules as made to be broken. People are often surprised by how playful I am in person - it doesn’t come through much in writing, where my intellectual side takes charge. (In this doc, my whimsical side keeps trying to slip things in, but my romantic side keeps overwriting them because it thinks finding a life partner is SERIOUS BUSINESS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person I’m writing this for might not have all the traits I’ve listed (or might not yet know that she does). But because we care about the same things on a deep level, I think she would want to have them eventually - just as the traits that she’s looking for are probably the ones I’m already aiming for. Maybe we can develop them together.\r\n\r\n\r\nA note on children\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main priority is finding the right partner; how many kids I have will largely depend on her preferences. Some possibilities I could be happy with:\r\n   1. A partner who wants to have 3+ kids and to be the main caregiver for them.\r\n   2. A partner who wants to have 1-2 kids and split responsibilities fairly evenly (but also get help from nannies etc, which I'm fortunately in a financial position to be able to pay for).\r\n   3. A partner who doesn't want kids because she (and I) find their work very meaningful and we want to prioritize that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize these are pretty different. One way of reconciling them: I want to have life projects with my partner; kids are one possible life project but not the only one; and so it's hard to be concrete before knowing who I want to co-create these life projects with. I'm not apathetic about kids—I think having kids is one of the most life-affirming things you can do. But I don’t want to rule out being swayed towards other life trajectories by the right person.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other things about me\r\n\r\n\r\nMy guess is that, for the people I’m looking for, the traits I’ve talked about so far are likely to be the strongest signal that we should try going on a date. But here are some other facts about me that might help:\r\n   * I’ve spent most of my career at frontier AGI labs, working on a wide range of different topics. Now I do independent research on what I consider to be the most impactful and interesting research directions in the world (a mix of AI governance and theoretical AI alignment). For an accessible introduction to my thinking, try this podcast. I’m excited about my work, and it’s important to me.\r\n   * I embrace life. I seize opportunities to dance, sing, travel, play practically any sport, read, socialize, and try new things. I’m energetic and adventurous.\r\n   * I am fundamentally okay with myself, even as I strive to be better. I don’t easily get flustered, angry, or insecure. Growing up in New Zealand gave me an underlying relaxed optimism about the world (although it's now often expressed via a very Californian type of ambition).\r\n   * I’m unfussy about many conventionally-valued traits like a partner’s level of formal education, career trajectory, finances, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think my weakest traits from a dating perspective are that:\r\n   * I’m not very empathetic on a gut level. This sometimes surprises people, because I'm unusually good at understanding and engaging with my own and others' emotions. But on an instinctive level, when I’m not actively trying to be empathetic, I still tend to default to thinking abstractly rather than putting myself in other people's shoes.\r\n   * I work a lot, driven in part by my belief that technological progress (and particularly progress in AI) is going to accelerate a lot over the coming decades, potentially making this the most important century. This may be disconcerting for some potential partners.\r\n   * I’m short for a guy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m still on good terms with all of the women I dated seriously during the past five years; here are reviews from two of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Richard is great. 5 out of 5 stars. It didn't work out with us but the quality of friendship we have now speaks for itself. He is one of the smartest people I know. Discussing things with him is great. Sharp and constructive. He has great friends. Absurdly good at any sport. Downside: bit chaotic, no taste for good food 😉\"\r\n\r\n\r\n“Richard is weirdly good at being in a relationship; I can think of three or four concrete ways I'm emotionally healthier after having dated him. One notable omission from this doc is the flip side of him being less empathetic than average on a gut level, which is that it feels easy to express feelings to him and negotiate conflict because he can accept intense emotions without getting caught up in them. He's more whimsical than the doc would suggest, though not less serious. Moreover, he is an excellent kisser and throws very good parties.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some photos of me:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we could be a good match (or you have a friend who might be), fill in my form, email me at richardcngo@gmail.com, tweet at me, tell a mutual friend to arrange a rendezvous, throw pebbles at my window, write me a song, or send me a document like this of your own! (If you're not sure what to say, tell me about a favorite book or song, or something you're looking forward to over the coming year.) If you’re uncertain, please do err on the side of getting in touch - writing is much lower-bandwidth for discovering compatibility than meeting in person, and the heavy-tailed outcomes here are skewed very positively!"

      "fullText": "﻿Pip Moss - Date Me Doc\r\n* Age: 35\r\n* Height: 5’6”\r\n* Occupation: Solicitor \r\n* Location: London, UK.\r\n* Looking for: Women, ideally long term relationship but open to starting and seeing where we get to. Not fussed on mechanics of relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Top priorities:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Significant Overlap of Values. We don’t have to agree on everything but I want to be able to wake up and spend a bit of every day helping you achieve your goals and feel good about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Intellectual Curiosity. I like knowing things, from trivia to social research, and I like people telling me things. I’ll enjoy learning new things for the rest of my life and it would probably be good if you did too because I’ll want to talk about them. Weirdly attracted to people who cite their sources in everyday conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * General Zest for Life: I like my calendar being fairly full of things to do, be they attending talks or trying a new type of exercise. I have main hobbies but am always up for trying something new. I’d really value someone pushing me in new directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Clear Communication. I’m a direct communicator and can only really be like that. I’m very honest (but not tactless) and take honesty fairly seriously, which friends and family mostly really like.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Independence. I want a partner, and a partnership, rather than someone to completely merge lives with until we are practically one person. I want to do lots of things with you but wouldn’t expect you to curtail having a life and projects outside of ‘Us’ and I’d want that balance for myself too.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Non-Negotiables:\r\n   * I don’t want kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I can’t bear the smell of tobacco. Am not much better with cannabis though if you never smoked where we lived I could maybe manage.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Slightly Negotiables:\r\n   * I’m a pretty committed urbanite. I’ve lived in London and Manchester, and might live in other cities in the future but really value living centrally and the lifestyle that allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I’m not religious or a believer in the supernatural, and while I don’t mind if you are I am unlikely to ever buy-in and share that beyond joining festivals to be supportive/share experiences.\r\n\t* My Main Hobbies: \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Bouldering, Running, Obstacle Course Running. Three years ago I tried bouldering and I’ve fallen into a fitness lifestyle since then. I climb twice a week, run a similar amount, and am working towards the London Marathon in 2026. Allez!\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Cooking. I cook from scratch almost everything I eat and like expanding my repertoire. Currently trying different seitan recipes as I become ‘Pesc-an’ (Vegan, plus fish). Got a great vegan brownie recipe. Love cooking for friends and family, and would love to cook for a partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Cat lover. Currently sharing my house with my cat Serral.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Random research online. From perusing Wikipedia (then double-checking it) to reading government reports, I like knowing more about the world. I’m the kind of person who will fact check myself online. I try to live an evidence-based life and want a data-driven world.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Visiting Museums/Galleries/Places of Interest/Classical Music Performances. No particular theme as to where, I just like seeing friends at somewhere more interesting than a coffee shop if we can. What else is life in London for? Most recent trip: Freemasons Hall. Beautiful but left me with more questions than answers!\r\n   *    * Political Gambling. I’ve been betting on elections since I was 20, with a good record. I sometimes write about it. But I’m an obsessive, not an addict. I even have the spreadsheets to prove it…\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Board Games. Also another great way to spend time with friends. I’m not hyper-competitive but do tend to do a bit of pre-research and want to give a good account of myself. OK maybe I am competitive, but I’m a pretty good loser.\r\n\t* Values/Personality (This is not a checklist of things you have to be):\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I value agency and intentionality, in myself and others. I fear too many people too much of the time make decisions passively, by default or the path of least resistance. I want to live deliberately. I get frustrated by adults not taking accountability for their lives and I want to be held accountable for mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Introverted but outgoing in a comfortable environment. I like a busy social life, just not so open to events with heavy drinking or loud music.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Organised. I believe in systems. I meal plan, I track my freezer contents in Excel, I check my net worth quarterly, I often instigate and co-ordinate social plans in my friendship groups. I even have a spreadsheet for when I last saw each of my friends so I don’t forget someone for too long (the name turns red after 90 days). They laughed, but then half of them asked me for the template.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * High Decoupler. I don’t take disagreement personally and am happy to discuss almost anything in a dispassionate way. I try to be sensitive to other people’s discomfort, but I’m rarely unwilling to answer a personal question or consider an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Environmentalist. I cycle most journeys if I’m not on the Tube and I very rarely fly for leisure at the moment (though I might in future, especially if I found some effective offsets). I’m also a YIMBY and a New Urbanist. Don’t own a car, but can drive and would get one if it made sense for my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Effective Altruist. By which I mean I donate 10% of my salary to effective charities and generally buy-in to the concept.\r\n\tSome more photos of me:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking the most of the period Serral was light enough to hold up on one arm. I actually have a shirtless version of this from another day but that felt tacky to share unprompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Parkrun photo with two friends who got me into running and whom I owe many thanks for that and much besides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEscape Room triumph with a friend of mine. The room was Battle of Britain themed, we didn’t just turn up like this. Sadly."

I’ve broken this down into work & purpose, family & community, relationship leanings, joy, food, location, and what I look like\r\nWork & purpose\r\nI work as a user researcher and self defence instructor. My research mostly informs public service and policy though I research anything interesting e.g. DIY gene editing tools, bike paths, storm response systems etc. etc. I also run an Empowerment Self Defence charity. \r\nFamily & community \r\nFamily & community are priorities for me. I listed my work initiatives first because it’s where I’ve put most of my energy in the past without quite realising I was doing it. Recently, I've resolved to intentionally cultivate community and create family, rather than assume this will all work out with minimal intervention on my part. I’d love to create a relationship with a community around it; a relationship that is in itself a family and that also generates more family in some form.  \r\nRelationship leanings\r\nI’m into monogamous relationships, ones that are co-located, and I’d love to be in a relationship that feels like a great team.  \r\nJoy\r\nI can’t think of a lot to say about it other than: why not make a point of generating and savouring it?\r\nFood\r\nYes. Please. Ideally vegetables. Moderate drinker, more of a savourer than a guzzler. Sweet tooth problem (cake I can guzzle for some reason?) \r\nLocation\r\nUK, London \r\nAre you open to relocating?\r\nI can imagine doing this under some circumstances, and definitely know how to. Yet after moving back and forth across 3 continents for most of my adult life, I’m trying something newish (to me): staying in one place, becoming rooted. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also think I’ve exceeded the threshold of how many long distance relationships are sensible to have in one lifetime, so best if a partner and I live in roughly the same place.\r\nWhat are you looking for in a partner?\r\nQualities I deeply appreciate include: kindness, curiosity, a general sense of presence, attentiveness, introspective skills, interest in bodies, not just in how they look but in how they are, and how they connect, co-regulation (← which is more of a relational than individual attribute, but such a magic thing that I think worth mentioning.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d like to be and to be with someone we’d all want on a team; someone resourced, with skills and perspective to bring to the mix, someone who values learning and growth, someone who has my back as much as I have theirs. \r\nWhat do you think a relationship even is?\r\nI think of a relationship as a creation; something we cultivate intentionally, consciously, caringly; something we feel worthwhile to maintain and nurture even when that takes a little effort after the butterflies stop fluttering all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’d love to create a relationship that changes and expands as we do; that forms a secure ground from which we can step out into the world, have rich experiences, change, grow, and bring those changes and that growth back to each other and watch them enrich our relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also think of it as bowls of soup on the couch in winter, watching each other's bags at the train station so we don’t have to lug them to the toilet, arguing well, giggles, surprises, whispers, building community and creating some form of family e.g. with children, dogs, neighbours, friends, or a subset of these.\r\nCan we just be friends?\r\nIf we’re compatible as friends, yes please. I cherish friendship and have space and time for new ones. \r\nWhat do you and your world look like? \r\nHere are some reasonably recent photos that feel relevant\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI sit in a chair lots for work but like to move so I practise and sometimes teach chair yoga\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\nI lived on a boat for a while, and started to find land weirdly rigid\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nOne of my favourite little friends and me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLip syncing to Whitney Houston for a pandemic-era work zoom flash mob (sparkly shirt courtesy of downstairs neighbour)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne of my besties and me on a cold UK beach walk \r\n\t  \r\n\r\nThis is an improv scene about a toothache \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA hackathon about improving outcomes for violence survivors with trauma-informed self defence \r\n\tHow can I get in touch?\r\nSend me a line here :)"

I’m also open to more “casual” possibilities, but if that’s what you’re after you should probably ignore this doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was 11 years old, as my 12th birthday was approaching, I noticed that the people younger than me tended to have grand ambitions - going to space or becoming president or, in my case, building a new continent. But the people older than me generally did not have such ambitions. Clearly something happened to nearly everyone as they got older, such that they gave up on their dreams and decided to get married, buy a house and have 2.5 kids instead. I was terrified that would happen to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I swore very hard never to do that - never to embrace a life of mediocrity. And that basically worked.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a cure for aging. I want weekend trips to the moon. I want flying cars and an indestructible body and tiny genetically-engineered dragons. I want to understand minds, be able to build them and edit them and read off their internals. I want things well beyond humanity’s current bounds, and the focus of my life is pursuing those goals wherever they may lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I also want - very badly - is a partner for that pursuit. And I do mean a partner - not a hanger-on, not an enthusiastic supporter, but someone with grand ambitions of their own and capabilities on par with my own or perhaps even greater. I want someone who can actually be a peer in pushing beyond humanity’s current abilities. Because that is what I need, in order to feel romantic love; nothing else seems to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n… and that’s it. There’s lots of little things I could say - I am sadly quite straight, I love dancing, etc, etc… but I’ve said the part which matters most and I don’t want to water it down further. If a partnership of pushing beyond humanity’s current abilities and making the world more to our tastes is something you want, you should get in touch and we can find out if we’re a good fit along other axes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to scope me out, I write a lot on LessWrong. A message on LessWrong is the most expedient way to get in touch if we don’t already have another channel; Facebook or the myriad of slack spaces also work if our social circles overlap already."

You’ll like her.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nA little context:\r\n \r\nMy last serious relationship lasted a whopping 11 years, and I’ve spent the past couple of years since then enjoying some solo time, focusing on personal growth and rediscovering old passions, with dating generally taking a backseat.   \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nI’m someone who has always been very independent and at this stage in my life I have the luxury of meeting all of my own material needs.  I’m not looking for a man to put a ring on my finger, to give me children, or to bump one another up the property ladder. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for is much more elusive!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a man I can call my home.  Someone to grow old with, to experience the euphoric highs of life with, and to soften the lows.  I’m someone who experiences the world with a degree of childlike wonder and awe, and I’m looking for someone with a similarly curious nature, who finds joy in the little things, has an optimistic and upbeat outlook, and an exceptional capacity for kindness, empathy and human connection.  We’ll travel, share new experiences, surround ourselves with a network of mutual friends and build a fulfilling life together. With a dog.  Or three. \r\n\r\n\r\nI consider myself an extroverted introvert, so whilst I’m a good conversationalist I like to balance social events with plenty of quiet time and prefer small groups/1-1 to big parties.  I’m equal-parts open book & intensely private, and I tend to be quite direct and unselfconscious, which has its pros and cons in dating.  I can be a bit of a pleasure-seeker and I believe it’s perfectly ok to outsource things outside of your skillset to others if you have the means to do it (cough, shall we get a gardener, cough?)  \r\n \r\nA few things I love:\r\n \r\n·          Reading - I have a mountain of books piled up by my bed and I generally get through a couple a month.  I particularly enjoy fiction written by women about the female experience but I also love most novels set in the Middle East.  My favourite read of 2024 so far is “Her Side of the Story” by Alba de Cespedes, and my favourite book of all time is The Stray Cats of Homs by Eva Nour.  I’m also a member of a non-fiction book club and we cover everything from neuroscience to mental health, travel, social causes and psychology.  I love the idea of reading a book in tandem with a partner so we can discuss it together.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          Theatre – I genuinely believe it’s the closest thing to real magic a person can experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          The water – My happy place is on or in the water.  Swimming, surfing, kayaking…I can proudly say my Dryrobe gets used for its original purpose, and not just as an outdoor Oodie.  Once or twice a year I chuck the dog in the back of the car and drive to Devon or Cornwall for some vitamin sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          The arts – This Spring I managed to get my hands on the new Fujifilm X100 and I’ve had a huge amount of fun recreating an analogue aesthetic and generally being a brat trying to snap candid photos of friends and family after they’ve just taken a massive mouthful of cake.  I’m interested in Brutalist and Bauhaus architecture, art, sculpture and contemporary poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          The outdoors – you won’t find me dragging you up Snowdon every weekend, but I’m definitely looking for a partner who shares my love of being outside.  I have a gorgeous sighthound, so long countryside walks are a big part of our day and a failsafe way to win her over.  More generally speaking, I love to eat al-fresco, cosy up in a pub garden under a blanket and discover new rambles on the AllTrails app. \r\n\r\n\r\n·          Good food – I want to know all the recommendations!  Where’s your favourite place for fresh pastries?  Or that local Nepalese gem that no one else knows about?  I bought my first pasta maker this year and now tortellini is my entire personality.\r\n \r\nAbout you:\r\n \r\nLet’s start with the non-negotiables.\r\n \r\n·          Aged 30-44\r\n·          Ideally based in the South East.  If in London, you should be happy to share time outside the city.\r\n·          Monogamous\r\n·          I’m leaning towards staying child-free, so it’s important that you either don’t want them, or are indifferent to them.  It’s fine if you already have them, though!\r\n·          No heavy-drinkers and no drug users\r\n·          Dog lover essential.  She’s part of the family and will be joining us on many of our adventures. \r\n·          You take pride in your ability to maintain your home and can cook.  \r\n \r\nThe rest…\r\n \r\nI’m a balanced person who tends to operate in lots of shades of grey.  I don’t tend to be attracted towards extremes and I generally prefer a more measured personality.  \r\n \r\nI find myself leaning into people who are comfortable showing vulnerability.  Intelligent people with a calm aura, who enjoy thinking a question through before they answer it, and who are secure in their sense of self and what they have to offer the world.  My personal brand of humour is dry and silly as opposed to lots of “banter” or loud jokes, but there’s no accounting for chemistry, right?\r\n \r\nYou’re passionate about your interests, quietly confident, an excellent conversationalist and sociable, but a little clumsy with it…  If you’ve ever said “love you, bye!” before hanging up on your boss and silently dying inside, I’ll probably find that sexy. \r\n \r\n·          You’re a successful professional (in any field) and financially secure.  I love a healthy-mix of wholesome low-key dates with the odd boujie restaurant and overpriced cocktail bar thrown in.  Ideally you’ll be comfortable enough that you can join me for things like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re not a workaholic.  It seems to be a badge of honour these days to be building the next Fortune 500 company with eleventy-billion side-hustles on the go, but I’m looking for someone who’s generous with their time and attention.  Ambition and drive are hot, but not at the expense of your personal relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\n·          You enjoy a mix of city & country.  I live semi-rurally and my weekends are full of trips to the farm shop, National Trust days, market towns and walks by the river followed by a coffee or glass of red.  My perfect date is a day at RHS Wisley to see the Autumn colours changing followed by dinner somewhere with a view.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re present in the moment and value real-world experiences.  You’re not addicted to social media, porn or gaming. \r\n\r\n\r\n·          You like to stay healthy and fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re romantic and enjoy caring for others.  Thoughtful gestures, remembering things they said they liked and little acts of service come naturally to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          It matters to you that you’re a good son, brother, uncle, friend, neighbour etc.  You value community and your personal relationships are important.  You’re welcoming and inclusive of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re kind and gracious in an argument.  You’re open-minded, accepting of others’ views, and happy to be challenged on your own.  You don’t think you know it all, you can admit when you’re wrong, and you’re open to compromise.  You are tolerant of those whose political or social views may differ from yours and can engage in debate while keeping things light and playful.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You’re a supportive partner who would view the two of us as our own little family unit, with or without children.  You’re open to creating our own celebrations and traditions and are looking for someone to grow something exciting and meaningful with, making our own rules along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n·          You have an adventurous streak and enjoy trying new activities and generally broadening your horizons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe prospect of meeting someone special is exhilarating but the whole online dating thing leaves me cold, so I figure why not inject a little old-school romance into the equation?  If you think we could be a good match (or you know someone who might!), take a tip from Tom Hanks and let me know why at datemelou@yahoo.com.  Better yet, send me suggestions for potential dates and fun things you think we’d both enjoy, and don’t forget to include a photo!"

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me Doc: Steven Elleman\r\nFeel free to send questions, feedback, snark, love letters, etc to steven.elleman@gmail.com . \r\n\r\n\r\nThe intent of this doc is to put some basic facts about myself online. If these facts feel aligned, then reach out. Some folks have reached out to say this kind of doc “spoils the mystery”. To me, the mystery is our emergent dynamic. It is what uniquely arises from us, what dance we co-create. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe previous version of this doc was aggressively autistic, feel free to check it out if you like walls of text: Date Me Doc: Steven Elleman (old)\r\nAbout Me \r\nI worked as a professional software engineer for 7 years, I quit last year to try to align my main life threads into one coherent braid. There are three threads in my life: (1) communal living, (2) secular religious exploration, and (3) “DWeb”. \r\n\r\n\r\n(1) matters to me because there’s magic to communal living that has made my life so much richer, and I want family in a communal context. (2) is about my relationship with myself and relationship with others. The magic that (1) offers feels like the right environment for (2), and I’ve been exploring different secular religious communities and running experimental retreats. (3) is a technical movement about a bottom-up version of the Internet and our digital world. I think (1) is the right vehicle for (3). Communal living is all about navigating shared resources and infrastructure; adding home servers into the mix makes a lot of sense. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat unifies these threads is simple: home. If I had a home with a community of people I deeply admire and love I think that’d satisfy most of my needs. I’m interested in building a new kind of home from the bottom up, one that makes sense to me. This is both the simplest and grandest kind of endeavor, creating my own community-home is a constant act of world-building. I long for a partner-lover-friend who wants to build it with me.\r\nRomantic Dynamic \r\nI build intimacy slowly. Using the body as a metaphor, I build intimacy through head -> gut -> heart -> sex. Head: on an intellectual level I need to think we have aligned values and goals. Gut: I need to feel safe with you, that you’re a stable, reliable, and integrous person. Only after my head and gut feel safe do my internal inhibitions drop, and I feel permissioned to fall in love. And only after that do I feel permissioned to feel sexual attraction. My story for this order and degree of inhibition is that I fear being trapped in a partnership similar to my parents – if I’m going to be committed I need to feel deeply aligned. Typically the way I build intimacy is through shared projects and lots of talking or writing. Romantically so far my pattern has been heterosexual and serially monogamous, and I would like to be a father.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeologically I subscribe to “relational presence”; I believe relationships of all kinds should honor whatever is present and alive, over stories of the relationship. What does a shared commitment to presence and aliveness look like? When stories are prioritized, feelings can be repressed out of a sense of responsibility or obligation. This is putting the cart before the horse. It’s putting intellectual stories over feelings which often represent a deeper and more embodied truth. In rational positivist thinking, the intellect trumps subjectivity and feelings. I believe this perceived superiority is at the root of many contemporary problems; it amounts to gaslighting. Feelings are facts. If feelings are facts, they’re always valid and legitimate. All wants, desires, fears, aversions, boundaries, etc are first-class citizens; stories must follow from the feelings, the cart must follow the horse. This allows radical honesty and transparency, eliminates unhealthy shame and repression, and ensures stories are constantly brought back into alignment with what’s actually being felt, what’s actually present and alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stories we tell often feel rooted in a desire for safety and control, fear of loss can prevent relationships from changing in necessary and beautiful ways. I see possession in conventional monogamous relationships as an attempt to prevent change and loss; in the process it puts the cart before the horse, it can put the story of the relationship before appreciation of what’s real. Loss is inevitable. People change. We’re going to die. I want to feel safe in the impermanence and change. Beyond acceptance of loss is savoring the preciousness of life. Denial of impermanence prevents savoring, it leads to clinging to stories and grasping for control that simply doesn’t exist. It leads to attachment to a story or image of self and partner over who they actually are, and in the process, aliveness is stifled, and self-deception takes over. \r\n\r\n\r\nI want to see and know you as you are, and I want to be seen and known in turn. I want to honor you in your full aliveness, and even if it’s brief and fleeting, at least it’ll be real. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis belief has been shifting all my relationships pretty significantly over the last year, and I’m still seeing how it coalesces with my historical romantic dynamic. \r\nRomantic Archetypes \r\nThere appear to be recurring archetypes that I’m drawn to. “Autistic” – women who emphasize intellect, principles, analytical reasoning – I feel safe with this archetype and there’s a shared interest in systems and reasoning. “Post-Rock Bottom” – women who had to go through emotional turbulence and have hit rock bottom before – I admire the resilience and acceptance of this archetype, often it has emotional depth and contrast, which I love. I often like being a “ground” for my partner and seem to be attracted to depressive and bipolar women – I like being a source of hope, optimism, care. “Shamanic” – I often like women who marry a high degree of sensitivity, attunement and intuition with spirituality. “Fiery” – I want a warrior. I like strong women. Beneath my outer layers of personality is a lot of fire. I’ve noticed I like women who are fierce, I know I can handle them, and I want them to be able to handle me. I can like the “Brat” archetype – I like being of service, but I like taking control in other contexts – some brattiness can strike a nice balance.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re some combination of Fiery Post-Rock Bottom Shamanic Autist Brat please reach out!"

      "fullText": "﻿Daryna’s Date Me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBackground\r\nUkrainian, living in Germany since 2015. I moved here for studies (rationally) and due to my late childhood memories of calm, clean cities and sporty, smiling people (emotionally). I've also lived in China and the States, so I’m fairly used to fitting my life into two (largely overweight) suitcases. I was supposed to move to Stuttgart but stayed in Berlin (mainly because my paintings no longer fit into those two suitcases).\r\nLanguages: German, English, Russian. Any of them goes, but I feel less witty in German.\r\nLocation: Berlin, DE. I previously couldn’t imagine myself moving elsewhere, but now that has changed, and I would switch cities for new experiences and to shake things up.\r\nHow I see myself: Emotional, curious, creative, extremely stubborn.\r\nHow my close friends/family see me: ‘She is kind, ambitious, self-reflective, and gives good advice. But beware of the girl, she’s an avid hoarder’ (the ‘avid hoarder’ part was probably about the amount of art supplies I own, haha).\r\nWho I am not: Never say never, but I’m not a party/club person. I feel comfortable around big numbers people at conferences and events at work but prefer smaller groups and dialogues in my private life. The quality of conversation matters to me. And the clubs nowadays don’t even play Britney Spears songs, so why would you want to go anyway, right?\r\nLW/EA community: This is how I came across the concept of a date-me-doc but wouldn’t expect any other approach from the rationalists. My approach towards charity and rationalism grew naturally till I found out that it is in tune with a large community out there. I would like to engage with it more on a regular basis since I agree that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\r\nRandom facts: I was part of a girls' band in high school. I put salt on top of sweet foods (ice cream, chocolate, porridge, etc.). My guinea pig was a centenarian (by animal measures, 8 years = 144 years) and had a collection of hand-made dresses, made out of socks and rhinestones  🎀 \r\n\r\n\r\nMy everyday life\r\nWork: I identify a lot through what I do, so my profession is worth a mention. I am an architect and an interior designer who is currently transitioning into the field of tattooing. I've been painting since I was little and previously used to sell my art. I paint with oils and digitally, also experimenting a lot with charcoal and ink.\r\nBooks: I usually read up to 5 books simultaneously, mostly sci-fi, dystopias, biographies, and non-fiction on society, economics, and psychology. I also love myths and fairytales of various nations. Currently, I'm relaxing my reading muscle and enjoying a fantasy book series from my childhood about a boy who was given ancient powers to rule Hell and his controversial journey to find Heaven.\r\nMusic: I really enjoy silence, to be honest. I am not much of a ‘music playing in the background all day long’ kind of person unless it's something repetitive like lo-fi. When I sit and listen to music, it’s usually some indie rock, hip-hop, classical, or jazz music. I am very unspoiled as far as the quality of the equipment, like sound systems or record players, goes, so feel free to teach me a thing or two about it.\r\nSports: Mostly yoga, pilates, and gym. I’ve had a quite bad knee injury and have been taking it slow since then. I would love to try more group sports and hiking in the future.\r\nActivities: Painting/sketching, photographing, singing. Redesigning my apartment for the 100th time, helping friends redesign their apartments for the 100th time, treasure hunting for new lampshades at thrift stores. Repotting my astonishingly fast-growing basil plants.\r\nWhere you can usually find me: Bookstores, vintage markets, parks, theaters, cinemas, somewhere in the streets (I walk a lot), or at home enjoying my afternoon beauty sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\nLove language: All of them matter, but I would pick Physical Touch and Acts of Service as my main ones. With Physical Touch being one of the things you can almost exclusively get in a romantic relationship, it is a very important feature for me. While Acts of Service show the invisible care, and I like their casual subtlety.\r\nStyle: Monogamous, long-term. Committed, honest, intimate, caring, romantic.\r\nLooking for: A kind, reliable, emotionally mature, ambitious person with a strong set of values they stand by.\r\nKids: For me, the partner comes first, and children are negotiable. I am looking for a person with whom I could share this experience, but having kids is not the main goal of a relationship. I want someone I know I can safely rely on while bearing and raising a child, sharing this responsibility together.\r\nSidenotes: I don’t drink/smoke/take drugs, so would prefer a partner with no habitual substance abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou made it to the end of this document! Feel free to contact me @silxxdar on Telegram or share this doc with anyone who you think would be a great match for me, thank you."

I’m not really jealous in general)\r\n* Location: Happy to relocate to anywhere if the climate is not extreme\r\n* Leaning towards staying child-free by default (>70%), but might be open to have kids with the right person\r\n🌸More about me:\r\n* I like learning things (when my brain fog permits) and my topics of interests are:\r\n   * Philosophy\r\n   * Psychology\r\n   * Behavioural economics\r\n   * Health/medicine/epigenetics\r\n   * Ethics\r\n   * History\r\n   * AI safety\r\n* But I’d enjoy people explaining things they’re passionate about to me, pretty much anything. I find it very attractive when someone’s very nerdy about things\r\n* I work really hard to improve myself, my health, and my life, taking one day at a time\r\n* I meditate regularly, and am trying to learn more about Buddhist philosophy and Stoicism. I don’t practice any religion\r\n* I go for walks daily, but my favourite kind of walks are nature walks, as well as culture walks in a foreign city on occasions. I also exercise regularly\r\n* I have overcome so many life challenges including dropping out of high school because of my health, severe depression for decades (no longer the case, yay!), illegal dismissal from employers, coming to London from Japan all by myself, changing careers from a pastry chef to a software engineer, accepting long term illnesses etc\r\n* I seem to get along best with people who are autistic and/or Rationalist/EA adjacent\r\n* I’m extremely agentic and get things done. Super responsible. Good at taking initiative. Used to be type A, worked really hard to not be.\r\n* I'm at my happiest when I'm around nature, and animals, reading/watching a film quietly, enjoying tasty food, wandering around a museum, or exploring a foreign place\r\n* I'm very good at cooking and baking, as well as cleaning. It would be nice to cook together with my partner\r\n* I have a good sense of humour, and am childlike\r\n* I'm smart and would like my partner to be way (ideally one more big 'WAY') smarter than me and teach me anything\r\n* Very cliche but I like watching films, listening to music, reading books…trying to get back into more creative hobbies like writing, drawing, singing, playing the ukulele, craft etc\r\n* I love cycling, swimming, and dance aerobics, and am pretty stoic about regular exercise and health routines - I’m very organised, independent and disciplined\r\n* I’m the kind of person who NEVER FAILS to pet a cat on the street, or always tries to rescue snails when they’re on the street\r\n* I love enjoying nice food (just tasty, doesn’t have to be fancy. In fact, my favourite kind of food is free food) and it’s very important to me that I can share that enjoyment with my partner\r\n* As you can see, I’m very autistic honest and transparent\r\n* I'm reasonable and able to change my views based on evidence. I apologise for my actions if I made any mistake. I might argue to understand and reach an agreement if there's a relationship problem, but I don't fight.\r\n* *In 2024, I moved from Camden (central London) to Milton Keynes (30 min train from London Euston) where there’s more green and is quieter. I live alone in a house full of plants with Toffin, and there are a bunch of cows 10 minutes walk away which I’m making friends with :)\r\n🌳What I’m looking for:\r\n* Companionship based on trust and deep friendship where we help each other grow and be a better version of ourselves, and be happy together. We respect each other's space and also enjoy each other's company. We feel truly safe and free to be ourselves.\r\n* Although I loved living in a big city where a community of friends are walking distance away, and I also want to travel around the world, at this point in life (how many years have we got before the AGI?), I want to live in the countryside with a big, beautiful garden with a bunch of animals. I would like a partner who would want to share that quiet, peaceful life mindfully, enjoying each other’s company and tiny little things nature would grant us each day\r\n* Having said that, I think I’d be pretty happy to not cohabitate as well - just meeting up regularly and keeping in touch, giving each other plenty of space\r\n* From my experience (most recent relationship lasted for 8 year) someone with below characteristics will probably work well with me:\r\n   * Very patient\r\n   * Very stable (not much emotional fluctuations towards negative direction in particular)\r\n   * Who is capable of loving someone deeply\r\n   * Very smart and knowledgeable\r\n   * Kind and caring\r\n   * Practices mindfulness/meditation and has basic understanding of psychology and philosophy in general, as well as communication (NVC, IFS etc)\r\n   * Has a great sense of humour\r\n   * Still avoids covid and wear a mask indoors, or is willing to avoid it for me (I certainly don’t need Long Covid on top of what I already have)\r\n   * Willing to communicate and be honest and transparent\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading! If you think you might get along with me, please don’t hesitate to contact me at chiakimizuta61@gmail.com or pass this to that weird friend of yours :) If you want a reference, my ex (who is now my best friend; we still have a great relationship, just no longer romantic. He moved to Berkeley so don’t fret) is happy to vouch for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLast Updated: 20/11/2025"

I'm from Connecticut. I’m adventurous. I like to travel - but I like to travel for ideas. I don’t care that much about money - but I do like to make money? I’m not sure about that one way or the other.\nI think I’m kind, interesting and thoughtful. I’m 5’9” or 5’10”? I like to keep my hair messy. And I wear a lot of interesting hoodies.  I have a law degree from Oxford. An undergraduate classics degree from UConn. I spend most of my time programming or doing law or walking.\n(Oh looking to date  - then see if you are interested in getting married - and I want to have children)\nIdeas\nI’m atheist, but I think in another time period, I would have been religious. I have had a number of different periods in my life when I was gripped by ideas. First, it was classics. Then, it was law (especially contract law). Then, it was computers. Now, it’s AI and machine learning. I talk about the ideas that I like pretty constantly. I tell a lot of jokes.\nWhat I really want to know are your interests! And, I want you to share them with me. I want to be with someone that wants to share their observations with me.\nLove Style\nI really like physical touch and to hold hands. I want someone that I can spend a lot of my time with as the relationship progresses. I really have very few demands. I like to let me partner live out their goals. But, I like my partner to let me live out mine. I’m small “c” conservative (so, monogamous). I’m thoughtful - but low key. I also try my best.\nPrevious partners have described me as “kind”, “thoughtful”, “gentle”, “honest” and “adventurous”. My most successful relationships have been with girls that were like me (not in a background sense but in a love style and ideas and career sense).\nI’ve also been described as “playful”.\nCareer etc…\nI’ve never had trouble with career but my career has been super unusual. I went from legal assistant to Chief Compliance Officer at a 2k person company. There is a whole story there. The company went public. I then took 2 years off. Then was first employee as Chief Product Officer at a Regulatory AI company. I just quit.\nI think about my career a lot - but I min-max for ideas. I don’t think anyone should worry about whether I have a provider mindset - I don’t - but I make up the difference by being highly performant and knowing what I want - and the things I want have always been highly remunerated.\nPhilosophy\nI’m not a rationalist. I honestly feel like I missed the boat on that; but the rationalists I’ve met are super interesting. I have a developed thought about what it means to be a good person, but I’m pretty tempered on all of this. I feel like that’s the benefit of getting older.\nI end up with friends across a very wide age bracket (my oldest friends are in their early 50s and my youngest friends are early 20s).\n(Oh, I’m straight as well)\nFeel free to reach out at nchutcheson@gmail.com"

If you think we might be a good match, I’d love to hear from you: please fill in this form.\n💡\nThis is weird: I dislike writing about myself, and my primary partner was excited to draft this for me, so this doc mostly describes me through his eyes. I’ve added comments where I would characterize myself differently. This document carried the prose of my primary partner moreso than my own voice.\n👉 You can also read the doc I wrote for myself (sans partner intervention) here.\nTestimonials\nI <3 Francesca, she’s awesome, and I feel super lucky to be her friend and partner!\n  - The guy who wrote this dating doc\nBurning Man, Mudpocalypse edition\nALT\nWho I am\n🌉 San Francisco & Oakland-based\n🐣 In my early 30’s\n🏳️‍🌈 Bi: I think I’d like to date all genders, but thus far I’ve only dated men. I’m open to more! 😉\n🎨 Crafty: I love creating things (I draw professionally as a digital illustrator), make cool hats (like my persimmon-shaped hat), fish backpacks, and so much more!\n🤪 Goofy: I enjoy being playful and uninhibited (with people I know well). I start out quite shy, however.\n🤫 Introverted: I’m not excited about being in big groups, especially with strangers, and it takes me a while to recharge from social situations. As a result, sometimes people who are just meeting me might see me as a bit colder… but once I get to know people I can be fun and goofy (see above!).\n🔐 A private person: I am an open book. But I am also the kind of person who won’t put that contents of that book on social media, or share personal details with others unless its on a need-to-know basis. I value my privacy and don’t often share things with strangers.\n🫂 Caring: my friends know me as being extremely empathetic, and go out of my way to help others - maybe even to a fault!\n🍣 Foodie: I love trying new foods, even though I’m a vampire-white American - when I travel, I’ll try almost anything once. Some of my favorites are jjajangmyeon, raw fish or poke (e.g. from Foodland), and mentaiko bowls. Let’s go on food adventures!\n✈️ Adventurous: I said “yes” to packing up everything and nomading in 2020, and also went on a 2 week adventure diving through the Galapagos and exploring other parts of South America last year. Burning Man is kind of my vibe too. I like doing this with other people, but it will take me a while to build up the trust to do this with you!\n🤼 Addicted to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: I know I go 6 times a week, but it’s not a problem, I swear. Just one more hit. 🥺\n👪 Poly-ish: I’ve started experimenting with having multiple partners, and I’ve enjoyed it so far! I’m a solo-poly type - I have a primary partner I live with, and date alone (as much as he might like to date you too 😜).\nWhat I’m looking for\n👫 A long-term relationship: I’d like to have a long-lasting friendship and connection, where we enjoy each other’s company outside of\n❤️ Sex, eventually: see @What I’m not looking for\n📅 Dates: let’s chat briefly to make sure it’s a good fit, and then meet in person soon! I think in-person dates are the most efficient way for us to find out whether we’re a good fit for each other.\n🧭 Someone I can adventure with: this can take many forms, like wandering through the city and finding good food, going to quirky events or museum exhibits together, doing outdoor things, you showing me something new, getting some delicious to eat, and much more!\n💬 Great communication: I think communication is super important, and is something I’ve been practicing myself - I’m looking for someone who is self-aware and can talk about what they’re feeling and what they want. I also appreciate having meta discussions about our relationship and ways we can improve it together!\n🛡️ Kindness & trust: someone who is kind to others, and to themselves, who deserves the trust of their friends.\n👾 Quality time: I love walks, video gaming together (e.g. coop), holding hands, cuddling…after the shyness part of me goes away, of course!\n❤️ Sex, eventually: see\nWhat I’m not looking for\nWrestling in Golden Gate Park\nALT\nWhat I’m not looking for\n🦄 An exclusive relationship: I have a few partners that I am very close to, and expect the partner I’m living with to be continue to be my main squeeze until we get old and wrinkly together!\n💟 Sex, at first: it’s really important to me that we like each other more than just wanting to get into each others’ pants - looks aren’t #1 for me when it comes to my interest in dates, and I’m much more interested in who you are and how your brain works. Sexual health is also critically important to me, so if we get to it (maybe in a few dates) let’s talk about what this means for each of us.\n🚭 Someone who drinks or smokes a lot: This isn’t a dealbreaker but a strong preference. I’d hope that my partner is working towards a healthy lifestyle, and drinking/smoking daily in my opinion hinders that progress.\n🗒️ A FWB-like relationship: see\n👫 A long-term relationship: I’d like to have a long-lasting…\nAlong the same lines, long distance relationships or relationships with a definitive end-goal in mind (for example, you’re moving to Europe in a year) are not appealing to me.\n🍼 Kids: I’m not interested in this for myself!\nUnless you consider your pets your children, in which case I will adopt them all. Any living thing counts (your cat, your gecko, your ant colony, your succulent collection, etc.).\nDabbling in diving!\nALT\nI went and got a boyfriend and all I got were these bad pics\nI love bubble tea and can make it, too!\nALT\nGangsta\nALT\nI made a persimmon-shaped hat! The photo doesn’t do it justice\nALT\nI love animals\nALT\nTasty\nALT\nMore tasty\nALT\nIguazu Falls with one of my partners - look how tiny I am!\nALT\nCotton candy from a machine, in Argentina!\nALT\nClimbing out of a volcano in Ecuador\nALT\nBaller - because of the fish bag I made\nALT\nBaller - because of the balls\nALT\nWow, you’re still here\n🤙\nIf you think we might be a good match, I’d love to hear from you: please fill in this form. Even if you’re unsure, you should contact me anyway! 0% risk, with potential for reward 🙂\nIf you’re really bored and want to read even more babble about myself in a more sterile format, or want to learn more before you contact me, you can browse the doc I wrote for myself (sans partner intervention) here.\nFran\n06/20/2024\nI’ve had experiences with women way, way long ago. I’d say my experience is very little, but not nonexistent\nFran\n06/23/2024\nMany people who know me, including my partner, like to poke fun about my skin color, and the dichotomy between where I was born and the kind of food/experiences I’m open to 😅\nFran\n06/20/2024\nhit/roll 😉\nFran\n06/23/2024\nStraight from the answer key: One of my two main love languages\nFran\n06/23/2024\nI also hate fascism! 🤣\nFran\n06/23/2024\nI love watermelon"

      "fullText": "﻿Please don't share publicly. \r\n\r\n\r\nHi, I’m Nadia, 29, seeking the right partner for an altruistic power couple. Get in touch with me or share with men who you think might be a good match.\r\nI work in a big consulting firm (for skill building and “earning to give”) but previously dabbled in pandemic preparedness policy, research, nonprofit work, and a biotech startup. Located in Berlin as of August 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is the most recent picture (July 2025). I need to update my photos however, I have since cut my hair to shoulder length\r\n🍦Pro\r\n* Energetic and bubbly. I laugh a lot, and I’m an easy audience if you want to test your own comedic aptitude. Examples of this:\r\n   * Exercise and humour are my favourite coping skills, so…—well, I better be strong and hilarious.\r\n   * I play improv and host improv workshops sometimes.\r\n   * I go hoarse before I run out of social energy.\r\n* Deliberate approach to life, love efficiency, agentic as fuck.\r\n   * Nothing that can’t be solved with a spreadsheet, a rubber duck, and coffee.\r\n   * I found my last longterm partner after less than 2 months of building a funnel with screening criteria and setting up 5-min video calls. I won’t be a great match for most, and want to be mindful of everyone’s time while I find the person who is. \r\n* Excitable & curious. \r\n   * I’ve been told that my questions are unique and inspiring.\r\n   * I can make surface-level boring topics like patent landscaping and ISO standards sexy.\r\n* Committed to self-improvement.\r\n   * I had a lot of coaching and have set up systems so I don’t make the same mistake twice. I like having essentialist routines and hacking my brain.\r\n   * I worked as a junior psychiatrist before. I am trained in CBT and NVC, and not afraid to use both to help us grow.\r\n* Emotionally stable & pragmatic.\r\n   * Friends appreciate how I balance succinctness and solution-focus with warmth and care.\r\n   * For years, I lived out of a suitcase and didn’t really have a home address. I also cached in dozens of rejections before finding my academic supervisor—but I’m really happy most of the time. This is to say, I’m rather tolerant of uncertainty and rejection in both my personal and professional life.\r\n⚖️ Neutral (?)\r\n* Vegetarian.\r\n   * It’s important to me that my partner is vegetarian or vegan, too.\r\n* I don’t do alcohol, cigarettes, or THC.\r\n   * I care about sharing an evidence-based, healthy lifestyle that acknowledges tradeoffs quantitatively.\r\n   * Not all drugs are created equal; I’ve found psychonauting with loved ones meaningful and connecting. \r\n* No children, by default.\r\n   * Unlikely circumstances such as ²⁴⁄₇ nanny support, a surrogate, and strong impact-related arguments could change my mind if my partner became very excited about having children.\r\n* Good dancer.\r\n   * As a pretty low priority, I would love to find someone who’s into dancing, too. But I’m too impatient to take beginner’s classes together. \r\n🦄 Con/”Niche taste”\r\n* I work a lot. \r\n   * I usually travel for work 4 days a week, and quite long hours. We’ll probably need to compromise and get creative to make space for enough quality time.\r\n* Disagreeable and very direct.\r\n   * I’m also responsive to feedback on my communication style. Still, I’m a better match for someone who enjoys mutual teasing and the occasional roast.\r\n   * I love people who sharpen my thinking—let’s be each other’s whetstones, like these two.\r\n* My sleep is sacred.\r\n   * I need to leave dates before 22:30, otherwise I turn into a pumpkin. Sometimes, I need to set timers for physical intimacy.\r\n🧩 And you?\r\nI’d like to find a partner who has been told he’s a great communicator and fundamentally cares about similar things as I do. Of course, I like all the things most people find attractive in potential mates (humour, intelligence, kindness, success, conventional physical attractiveness, etc). However, I don’t believe I—or anyone, really—can armchair checkbox-criteria for compatibility. You should err on the side of getting in touch! I won’t bite I only bite with consent!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’ve read until here and think we vibe, tell me why we would make a great team, and I’ll make time to chat: nadia@montazeri.co or via Facebook messenger (Nadia Xenia Montazeri). Please also share some photos or links to socials. 😊\r\n⭐ Testimonial\r\nI’m good friends with Jan, my previous partner, and I asked him for a review I could add to this document. Here’s what he wrote:\r\n“Nadia and I were in a relationship for two years, so as a Nadia connoisseur, I want to share my experience with you. Reading this document, you might feel like I felt eons ago, when I first encountered her. A bit intimidated, a bit confused, but also intrigued and excited. Being with Nadia is an acquired, yet highly rewarding taste.\r\nYou know how when you go lift weights, you should have a spotter? Someone that both has your back, but also pushes you to improve?\r\nNadia is like that, but for life. Being with her is like standing on a skyscraper-grade foundation and simultaneously jumping on a trampoline. \r\nYou're having a good day? You will not find a more bubbly, more enthusiastic, more supportive person to share it with. Nadia is thirsty for life, and she will show you how to drink your day with gusto. Her shenanigans are legendary and her laughter is more contagious than a pandemic.\r\nYou're having a bad day? She will hold you and show you that it's okay to be vulnerable, that it's okay to be human. With her, heaven is just a hug away. Nadia deeply cares about those around her, and she will always be there for you. She is a person both sharp and soft, both strong and gentle, both wise and curious. Nadia has a vast, vast soul, a one-of-a-kind soul that you will always remember.”\r\n🎨 Pictures\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Pyjama party! I’m the one with the pink toothbrush)\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n(yes, I’m tiny, 1.57m)"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi, I'm Ori!\r\nI'm looking for a playful companion to go on shared missions, the piece of myself I don’t know that I am missing... If you resonate with what you read, you can just send me your profile, a small description of yourself and/or answer one of the icebreaker questions I put for you at the bottom. My email: ashesphoenix235@gmail.com\r\nIf you know someone who you think fits, feel free to send them the link to this doc.\r\nAll photos from 2023\r\n    \r\n                                                                                                                         The one with the white shirt is me.\r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\nbased on recent endorsements: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t[Placeholder for sophisticated show-don't-tell pieces of text that display that some of those adjectives apply to me.]\r\nOther long-term customer reviews: \"She is a rare dialectical mix of very rational and very emotional.\"\r\n“Looks like Tinkerbell”\r\n\tWhat tests say about me: \r\n* BIG 5: Very high “Openness to Experience” and “Agreeableness”, average “Emotional Stability”, “Extraversion”, and “Conscientiousness”.\r\n* Outlier scores: Mensa member, hyper-phantasia (vivid mental experiencing), Highly Sensitive Person (HSP: feeling intensely).\r\n* Hogwarts hat announced: 37% Ravenclaw, 29% Gryffindor, 19% Hufflepuff, 15% Slytherin.\r\nWhat I say about myself:\r\n* Ordinary romantic carbon-based cell-cluster looking for their person\r\n* I am into science, entrepreneurship, psychology, health, AI, Sci-Fi, love, and making music. \r\n* I have a personality, hobbies, and questions, like lists and statements with percentages.\r\n\r\nSome hard facts\r\nBody: tiny, athletic (exercises almost every day), in her thirties, overestimated 38% muscle mass (the rest is mainly cucumber), vegan, and low-carb when convenient.\r\nOrientation: Hetero, monogamous, on the demi- and sapiosexual spectrum, switch, unlikely to want kids (20%, in case my future partner can inspire me with his vision of a family and the shared mission around it).\r\nLocation: Currently living in Berlin, but want to move somewhere else. Looking for one or more places to make and call home. Often traveling to explore different cities.\r\nSome soft facts\r\nGood conversationalist. People who have just met me frequently state that they enjoyed conversing with me to an unusual extent, that they feel seen and inspired. Also, partners and friends often acknowledge my constructive and compassionate way I deal with and communicate during conflicts, even in heated situations or when I feel hurt.\r\nFemale MacGyver: I can heat the flat by opening the oven, prepare eggs in a water cooker, find and use the holes in systems. My time on this planet has shown again and again that problem-solving to bring something useful and new to life seems to be my superpower.\r\n\r\nWhat I do\r\nMy calling. The work I do isn't just a career—it's an extension of my deepest hope for humanity. Each small victory in creating positive change fills me with a sense of purpose that resonates through everything else in my life. Operating at the intersection of science, mental health, and kindergarten-ing (leadership ;), I founded, built, and manage a Non-Profit Organization. Based on the principles of Effective Altruism, we aim to do good better and to prove if we actually do that. Soon, I'll attempt to build something new. One thing I am proud of is that I have been the youngest professor ever appointed at the university where I used to work.\r\nMaking music. I play the keyboard and the organic instrument (voice ^.^), very gladly and very mediocre. Single-player and multiplayer modes are available. Genres: mainly jazz, rock, and soul. Covers, improvising, or songwriting. My favorite quote from myself: \"Nothing is so bad that you can't write a good song about it.\" I might get excited to show you songs I contributed to or wrote at trust level 3.\r\nLearning. Learning new things lights a fire in me that's hard to describe—it's that rush of connecting dots, of seeing the world through a new lens, of feeling my mind expanding.There is a long list of topics I'd like to dive into. Recent topics I've learned more about: ETFs, spine-related and supplement science (medical stuff), and how to build and prompt LLM agents. Also, I am still on the journey to finding a type of dance to do regularly again. The latest ones tested: contact improvisation, Bachata and Swing dance (beginner+), before that, pole dance, and Aerial hoop (not so much a beginner).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy social life\r\nCommunities: I love mingling at national and international weekends/events organized by communities such as Dynamite Circle, Effective Altruism, LessWrong, Mensa, Burning Man.\r\nSharing. Understanding how the world works and what it looks like for other people, especially those close to me and those I admire, has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was a teenager. Many thoughts during my day are dedicated to this. I love listening to people sharing their latest insights, ideas, or solutions they came up with, e.g., their new start-up pitch, or results from their daily observations or experiments with reality.\r\nClose ones. The friendships I treasure most are the \"Frodo & Sam\" type, where silence feels as comfortable as conversation, where the connection remains unshaken even through life's storms, and where you know you could call at 4 am, and they'd be there for you as you'd be for them. I feel lucky and thankful to have a few of those humans in my life.\r\nWhat I am looking for\r\nTL;DR: A vulnerable Chuck Norris with empathy ;-). A loving and deep companionship.\r\nI'm seeking someone whose presence feels like coming home after a long journey— safe, and exactly where I'm meant to be. Someone whose mind challenges mine and who knows the melody of my heart by heart.\r\n   * Male and single, 26–43 years old\r\n   * Caring, cognitively and emotionally empathetic\r\n   * Altruistically ambitious: works or would like to work on projects that make the world better. No astrology or healing stones stuff :-)\r\n   * Intellectually excitable: enjoys learning, exploring with their mind, and growing together\r\n   * Emotionally in tune and mature, secure attachment style, high reliability\r\n   * Overall healthy lifestyle: does not need to be a vegan yogi, just someone who takes care of themselves and their future self to age in a healthy way\r\n   * Playful and humorous\r\nPlus points:\r\n   * Would be okay to live in one or multiple moderately-sized cities (300k-1M) close to larger bodies of water, and somewhere not too cold in the winter\r\n   * Has a creative outlet one can engage in together, e.g., plays at least one instrument well, and maybe would like to jam together\r\n   * Might be interested in working on projects, initiatives, or organizations together one day\r\nIn case you’re uncertain how to approach me, here are some icebreaker questions you could answer:\r\n   * What is your current mission, and what would you rise from the ashes for?\r\n   * What was a bold decision that you made recently?\r\n   * What is one thing you changed your mind about recently, and the reason why you did?\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNo, no, pinky promise, this is really me! ;-)"

      "fullText": "Here's looking at me – Telegraph\nHere's looking at me\nLuca\nMay 17, 2024\nHere's looking at me\nLuca\nI am a run-of-the-mill carbon-based life form, living on the planet currently known as Earth (or so I've been told). If you're reading this, it's highly likely you've come across my profile on Hinge. This must be the fourth or fifth time I've created an account there. It's not that I haven't had any luck -- I've connected with some interesting people, but obviously nothing that has worked out well enough to stop me wanting to go back.\nI thought I'd write a profile (a \"\ndate-me doc\n\" of sorts) for those piqued enough by the very limited window provided by Hinge to want to get to know me more, but on second thoughts I thought I'd do something different. So here's a list of reasons NOT to date me:\nI'm married. No two ways about it: some time in 2005, I entered into a civil marriage, which is still valid on paper. The marriage didn't work out, and my wife and I have lived separately since 2018. Neither of us see the point in getting a divorce as of now, but this will obviously change if there's a good enough reason for it. Needless to say, neither of us has problems with the other seeking other romantic interests.\nSteinbeck once referred to poor Americans seeing themselves as \"temporarily embarrassed millionaires\". Well in my case the pandemic and its aftermath has found me in a similar circumstance of temporary embarrassment (which I hope is truly temporary). I work with languages and have freelanced all my working life -- something that worked just fine, despite the unavoidable ups and downs, until a few years ago. Every now and then, it does begin to look like things might pick up again, but only time will tell if they really do. So all you prospective sugar babies can happily walk right past me and I hope you manage to find your pot(belly) of gold. But for those of you who might still be willing to overlook this: I have never been that interested in making money or other indicators of worldly success. Right now, the only interest I still have in doing so is to uphold my commitment to my children (did I mention I have children? Well I do: two of the most wonderful persons I've ever had the pleasure of knowing).\nI can be a bit of a curmudgeon -- it's hard to get me excited about what's happening in the world outside (or even convincing me of its existence on some days), at least not for its own worth. In the right company, however, even the most humdrum, everyday activities take on the aura of the most exciting thing the world has ever known, and more than anything else, this quest of mine is for that right company.\nThat's it for now, but I'm sure there are many more reasons to weigh the prospect of seeing and going out (or staying in) with me very carefully. I promise to add them to the list as and when they occur to me.\nEdit\nPublish\nReport content on this page\nReport Page\nViolence\nChild Abuse\nCopyright\nIllegal Drugs\nPersonal Details\nOther\nPlease submit your DMCA takedown request to\ndmca@telegram.org\nCancel\nReport"

I’m pretty close to my family and they play an important role in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up vegetarian and became vegan 10 years ago because I care about reducing animal cruelty. It’s not a dealbreaker but I’d prefer to be with someone who is plant-based or at least respects the decision I have made.

      "fullText": "﻿João’s Date-me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! How fun is this? Date-me docs! Is that a great idea, or what? (no, really, I’m actually asking)\r\nAbout me\r\nMy name is João. Don’t worry about how to pronounce it. I’m 5'8\" and 48 years old. I’m Portuguese, but I’ve been living in Cambridge (UK, not MA - sorry Massachutessans!) for over 10 years, where I work as a software engineer. Oh, almost forgot:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the pictures are a few years old, but you can easily recognize the more recent ones by the amount of grey hair. I come complete with the dad-bod and the dad jokes, but no actual children. Trying to be more fit, but it’s been a slow process, and the frequent travels to Portugal where the amazing food is very hard to resist don’t help.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m more often in than out, but let’s talk about out first: I enjoy going to the cinema, meeting friends at the pub, having fancy dinners, going for a nice walk. My geeky side also likes board games, escape rooms, bowling, that sort of thing. I was very keen on standup comedy in the past (and was once a standup comedian myself!) but haven’t been there so much lately. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I’m in, I’m probably watching Netflix shows, or playing video games. If you’re also a gamer, great, let’s play something together; if you’re not, don’t worry, my gaming is always secondary to my dating, or any other social activity for that matter. Back to Netflix, I like mostly sci-fi, anything “mind-bending”, psychological horror, and (true or false) crime dramas, but I have a soft spot for sitcoms and romantic movies. I can also be found listening to podcasts while doing house chores, or doing homework for my Italian classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a firm believer that Everybody Likes Travelling™ (admittedly some more than others), so that’s really a non-question. My relationship with travelling is a weird one: I’m not a travel-obsessed person but actually end up travelling a lot. I’ve been to 4 continents (treating North and South America as 2) and 10+ European countries, but never to Paris. Or Ely, for that matter. I’ve travelled alone before, but it’s not the same without the right company.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live comfortably, have my own flat, live a peaceful and quiet life. I’m independent, quite used to being on my own, simply looking for someone to go out with, talk to, share and care (and touch and kiss).\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nMy phone. Almost every time. The keys are usually always at the same place but the phone could be anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously though. I’m looking for a straight, monogamous, long-term relationship. I’m not too picky, but be aware that I’m probably writing a whole page detailing who I want you to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, regardless of what you read below, if you’re looking for friendship or just someone to talk to, go ahead and send me a message! I’m friendly and a good listener, as long as you’re not harassing me or asking me for money on the Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers: smokers and drug users (which is the minimum, really), covered in tattoos or piercings (one or two are fine).\r\n\r\n\r\nNo limits on age, height, race, but be aware that I’m 48 and 5'8\". Some women like them tall and some women like them young and I’m neither of those.\r\n\r\n\r\nProximity is important. If you live around Cambridge that’s ideal; London and Essex are ok too. If you live further away, I think we better stay as friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are one or more of these things, that’s fine, but be aware that I’m not: vegetarian or vegan, religious or spiritual, right-wing, sports fan. I’m very tolerant and accepting of other people’s beliefs, convictions and lifestyles (and I like the occasional vegan meal), but I’m not looking to change my own on these matters (ok, you might be able to convince me to get into sports).\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren are welcome: I like them and in general they tend to like me too. I don’t have any and it’s too late for me to get my own now. Grandchildren is where I draw the line - I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. If you don’t have children, that’s fine too, it means we have more time for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPets. I know some of you are very passionate about your furry friends. I like both dogs and cats but have none of them. The closest thing to a pet are Tom and Ada which are my tomato plants and are still surviving despite my inexperience with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for one person only. If only one of you replies to this and turns out to be the right one, that’s enough for me. But of course that’s in an ideal world, and in the pursuit of a long-term relationship sometimes we have to stumble in a few short-term ones. Also, I have a bit of trouble juggling different relationships even before the point of official exclusivity, so apologies if you get put on hold (I know, that’s a terrible thing to say, and I’m sorry) while I’m dating someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, physical attractiveness, chemistry, sparks, these kinds of stuff are highly subjective but important (as I’ve learned over the years). While in principle I don’t discriminate between age, size, race, etc., if I don’t feel physically attracted to you, or if I somehow feel that the chemistry is not there, then it’s not going to work. That goes for you too, obviously.\r\nIf you’re interested\r\nAn email would be great, to djeidot@gmail.com. As you can probably tell, I like people who write a lot. Search for djeidot on Instagram if you prefer to start with just a Hi and go from there."

      "fullText": "﻿Text me maybe? \r\nI read about Date Me Doc recently, and I was excited to get started. I try to make it as digestible as possible, if anything is not clear just ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n*       \r\n\r\nMy Story \r\n   * Age - Mid 30s\r\n   * Height - 5ft 7\r\n   * Sexual orientation - Straight, strictly monogamous \r\n   * Location: London, UK\r\n   * Languages - English, Mandarin, Korean, Malay, (want to learn Spanish)\r\n   * Human Design Type: Manifestor\r\n   * Attachment style : Fairly secure, tendency to be anxious\r\n   * Love languages: Beyond touch, act of service and words of affirmations; I seek stability, commitment and conscious communication\r\n   * What I can offer: Patience. Listening. Awareness. Conscious communication. Friendship. Independence. Space. Teamwork. Compassion. Reassurance. Personal and relationship growth. Shared memes. Comfortable Silence. Delicious food. Emotional and Physical Intimacy \r\n   * Life quest: learning how to swim, free-diving, own a 5-bed home, have family, and own a book cafe that encourages people to disconnect from their online world. \r\nMalaysian-born mixed-race life enthusiast, who finds joy in little moments and is passionate about personal and professional development. Single-handedly raised by my mother, I learned the values of resilience, determination and gratitude from an early age. Despite its challenges, my childhood was filled with beautiful memories, love, laughter and experiences. My academic journey took me to South Korea, and ultimately to UK, where I now call home. \r\nFamily holds a special place in my heart. I live with my mom since my last relationship, and remain in close contact with my brother, who’s married. I have a close knit circle of friends and community, who I consider extended family – these connections ground me and remind the importance of love and support. \r\nImportant to know - I don’t drink alcohol,but I have an active social life. I enjoy socializing in ways that foster deep conversations via conversation cards and shared experience. I enjoy hosting, inviting friends over for dinner or social events. In addition to that, I seek spiritual experiences such as cacao ceremonies, breathwork sessions, and forest bathing. These activities allow me to connect with my inner world, God, nature and explore different dimensions of consciousness, and deepen my appreciation for the world around me. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love books - self growth, historical, geographical and autobiographies. I love random adventures, peace and quiet. I love everything about nature, indoor, outdoor spaces, fresh air. I love warm nights sleeping with the windows open.I am the type of person who gets excited about sunrises and sunsets, the night sky, thunder and the scent after the rain and engages in deep conversation while holding a mug filled with hot chocolates, sitting by the fire. I love not wasting. I love freshly squeezed orange juices. I love and I love and I hope I always keep on loving and choose love. \r\nI find joy in movements, of any sort - lately, I have been redefining my own limits and engaging a lot with salsa-bachata dancing, F45 exercises, Hyrox and the Turf Games competition. I also love reading, watching documentaries, and listening to podcasts - constantly expanding my knowledge and understanding of how this world works. \r\nWhat I am seeking:\r\nI want to connect, and genuinely get to know that person at a deeper level before we decide to embark on a journey called relationship. In my case, I am looking for my life partner. \r\nMy ideal partner is someone who shares similar values, which are non-negotiables —fitness, family and growth mindset. Ideally, someone who appreciates physical, emotional and spiritual intimacy, physically active, adventurous, trustworthy, has the ability to be vulnerable, and appreciates PDA.Ideally my partner would:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Prioritize family -I value maintaining strong ties with yours, my family and/or building family of our own. \r\n   * Want children - I want to have only one child and to conceive naturally. I love my life, enjoy travelling and I want to continue doing the things that bring me joy, finding my purpose in life and contributing to this world. I want to share these experiences with you and our children. Therefore, one is enough. I believe in natural order, and will not endure the pains and lengths of IVF or egg/embryo freezing to have children. \r\n   * Be physically active - Share my passion for physical activities and maintain healthy lifestyle. Love outdoor adventures.\r\n   * Growth and abundance mindset - embrace positive outlook of life, focusing on growth, gratitude and the belief that there is enough for everyone and there’s solutions to every problem. \r\n   * Vulnerability and communication: I believe that having the ability to be vulnerable allows deeper intimacy. Conscious, open, honest communication is important to me. \r\n   * Kind - Display kindness not just towards me, but to everyone around you, me, us, including animals. \r\n   * Shared household responsibilities – be willing to contribute equally to household tasks and chores, as well as taking the initiatives to keep our relationship alive through planning dates and quality time together.\r\n   * Spirituality - Have a strong faith or spiritual practice, willing to do the deep work. Spirituality is an important part of my life and I would like to share /exchange that with my partner. \r\n\r\n\r\nDate Bucket List\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Parkrun 9am Saturday & brunch\r\n   2. Farmer’s market \r\n   3. Arcade fun \r\nQ&A with Bilqis\r\nConscious relationship agreement - core values (something I’d like to have when we get into relationship)\r\n   1. No secrets - imagine our connections to each other like a living energy between us. I’ve noticed that with most relationships the natural tendency is for this filmy layer to build up between us, small unspoken things or untruths only add to that layer and it becomes hard to truly see and feel close with each other. Radical honesty is a way of wiping away that layer between us. It keeps the connection clear. This doesn’t mean we don’t respect each other’s privacy. \r\n   2. We are a team. As a team we get to play to our strengths. The ways we show up in our relationship are unique and there isn’t an expectation that because I do X, you will do X. It’s more about how can we both most authentically contribute and does that dynamic leave us both feeling nourished and supported. \r\n   3. No one outside the partnership knows more than we do. There isn’t a single (consequential ) thing someone else could tell me that I don’t already know. In moments of tension, instead of my first reaction being venting to friends, this practice has encouraged me to go inward first, to journal or speak to my partner to work through it. \r\n   4. No request or feeling is inherently “wrong” and everything can be talked about. Let’s create a space that felt like freedom, not judgement. All requests and feelings are valid even if we can’t meet that request in the moment. I want to feel safe to express my innermost thoughts and needs. It’s also been an amazing practice in hearing someone without needing to fix or change, just listen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext steps, if you are interested in getting to know each other better, please do\r\n   * Drop me a line via IG @hej.bilqis or my LinkedIn profile\r\n   * Please include a link to your Date Me Doc and your photos if your Date Me Doc doesn't have them"

One day, it was revealed to me by divine inspiration that Dorian's name is actually Gary Holcombe.  He felt confused at first, but he took to it pretty quickly.  Then, before long, he decided that my name is also actually Gary Holcombe.  We've been Gary and Gary ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat percentage of my life do I spend consuming text?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nProof that my Kinsey score is actually 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAm I exploiting the bridge study by showing you a pretty sunset?  Maybe.  Maybe I am.\r\nNonfiction is magic\r\nThe first thing you should know about me is that I read SO. many. books.\r\nDo you read?  Eighty points of extra credit if you guzzle nonfiction too.  I want to hear from my fellow bookworms!  You can win my heart by talking to me about books.\r\nHere's an old list of books I considered life-changing when I read them.\r\nHere's a newer list of all the books I've finished in the last two years.  (The two lists don't overlap.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite subjects is “applied psychology”—relationships, EQ, communication, motivation, parenting, and happiness.  I consider that genre one of the best tools for leveling up as a person.  What would the world look like if more people invested time in this?\r\n(Someone who knows me well looked at this part and said: “Your special interest is relationships.”  Take that as you will.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my other favorite subjects are: business, sociology, economics, neuroscience, cooking, sexuality, cultural history, memoirs, and many more.  The secret manual for life is sitting right here in plain sight!  And it's free!  Libraries are a point discontinuity in capitalism—a 100% taxpayer-subsidized public good!  It's true what they say: teachers (including authors) can open a door, but it's up to each individual to walk through that door.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, my ideal partner is a curious lifelong learner who finds joy and meaning in continuous personal growth.  I dream of bringing out the best in each other for decades and decades.\r\nHelp me stay on track to master cooking?  Write poems?  Play instruments?  Compose music?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I help you stay inspired to do?  I want to be a person's rock while they grow toward their dreams.  I want to surprise my future spouse with little gifts to support their projects and interests.  If part of that looks like evangelizing books to each other, I'll be thrilled.  😉\r\nWhat I'm like as a partner\r\n  \r\n\r\nEver since I saw this, I've been saying “geef” and “beef” in my head.\r\nSadly, the non-binary case has an awkward near-homophone.\r\nCould we say they're a “theef” of hearts?\r\n\r\n\r\n* Super duper affectionate\r\n   * Near-constant stream of verbal and physical strokes\r\n   * Figuratively-never not touching you\r\n   * Will use pet names more than your legal name\r\n* Rotates through all five love languages\r\n* Generous with shoulder rubs\r\n* Practices and expects non-violent communication\r\n   * This is a hard requirement\r\n   * Git gud\r\n* Wants to play games\r\n   * As in Dominion with a capital “D”, not a lowercase “d”\r\n   * Please try as hard as you can to beat me\r\n   * Please actually be able to beat me (or be willing to learn / find fulfillment in sharpening your game)\r\n   * Sparring passionately in mind-sports is a profound form of intimacy & a peak human experience\r\n      * Goodness gracious, I want an energetic rival/lover who gives me a run for my money\r\n      * Remember that part in Atlas Shrugged where the young Dagny and Francisco are playing tennis?\r\n         * DISCLAIMER: I placed as a finalist (top 1% worldwide) in the Ayn Rand Institute's Atlas Shrugged essay contest, and will happily talk to you about why Rand is crucially mistaken about the basic mechanics of human psychology but nonetheless raises some interesting points that are otherwise unheard in politics and must be redeemed by nuanced thought and application that Rand herself would likely reject unless she's cooled her jets a bit in the afterlife\r\n         * If you found the above disclaimer unnecessary because you celebrate intellectual curiosity, critical inquiry, and literary cosmopolitanism, please message me already!\r\n   * I can still love my partner even if we don't spar in games, but it would be really great if we did\r\n* Wants to feed you…and be fed by you\r\n* Excellent at playing unofficial therapist\r\n   * Yay, reflective listening and emotional literacy\r\n   * Have been told I’m about as effective as a well-liked real therapist\r\n   * Would also support your seeing a real therapist\r\n* Wants to build you up and emotionally co-regulate you and see you thrive\r\n   * Your joy is my joy\r\n   * Let's achieve some power-couple dreams together!\r\n      * Build a dream house?  Start a business?  Raise a loving family?  Organize a conference?  Found an eco-village?  Go on a food tour of our ancestral homelands?  (Mine's Italy—just saying.)  Compose a duet?  Revel naked under the full moon?\r\n* Clothing optional when it's just us at home\r\n   * The constant warm glow of intimacy from casual nudity with a partner is just…yes\r\n\r\n\r\nA partner who racked up eight years with me offered these suggestions to flesh out the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Wonderful conversations.  Oh, my God.  So much depth.”\r\n* “Endless memeing and inside jokes.”\r\n* “Speaking our own language we've formulated over the years.”\r\n* “Stealing your tea.”\r\n* “Going to Rationalist meetups and philosophy meetups.  And going dancing.”\r\n   * I'm rather new to social dance, but I want to up my game\r\n* “Walks in nature.”\r\n* “Looking at sunsets.”\r\n* “Staying physically active.”\r\n   * Running, hiking, four-square\r\n   * Organizing regular four-square games with a friend group!\r\n   * UPDATE: Weight training and pickleball!  I guess SF got into me.\r\n* “Going to li-ber-ries.”\r\n   * [sic]\r\n   * emphasis on the second syllable\r\n* “Being upset about temperature dysregulation.”\r\n   * I run cold\r\n   * Warmth is love\r\n   * Please ensconce me in warmth\r\n* “Being distressed at noise.”\r\n   * I never go anywhere without three different kinds of earplug in my left pocket\r\n   * Where are my twice-exceptional babes at?\r\n* “Wanting to eat, but not wanting to go out to buy food.”\r\n* “I'm just saying bullshit.”\r\n* “Being cute.”\r\n* “Studying and working passionately.”\r\n* “Talking to people.”\r\n   * “You're very social and outgoing, you know?”\r\n\r\n\r\nShe's great.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOops, I meant: “Rotates through all six love languages”.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCorrect, but they forgot memes.\r\nBasic info\r\n* Age: 31 (est. 1993)\r\n* Sex: male\r\n* Kinsey score: 2\r\n* Height: 6'1\" (and a quarter)\r\n* Pronouns: they/them\r\n* Gender: “Objection!”\r\n   * (say it in a Phoenix Wright voice)\r\n* Born and raised in: Bay Area\r\n* Currently in: Bay Area (formerly Seattle)\r\n* Occupation: startup founder and software engineer\r\n* Future location: wherever “my people” are—and especially where “my person” is\r\n   * So, maybe Berkeley for the ACX readers, or SF for the entrepreneurs?  Or some other city?  I don't know yet, and I want to find out.  I have yet to discover a subculture that shares all, or even most, of my core values.  ACX readers come the closest, but on average, they're missing relational warmth and vibrant affect.  Did I mention I'm a shameless glutton for cuddling and feelings?\r\n      * Update: I’ve found an interesting match (somewhat, ish) with TPOT culture, and I’m trying out the Hayes Valley neighborhood in SF!\r\n      * Update: TPOT culture lacks an intact contract of mutual care, and Hayes Valley ain’t it.  Next on my list: the Outer Sunset neighborhood in SF.  Perhaps, someday, I’ll check out…New York??\r\n   * Like most of my peers, I want to escape cars and atomization.\r\n* Kids: leaning yes/maybe; it depends\r\n   * I have dual concerns about this.\r\n   * I believe humanely navigating the child-rearing years requires some combination of family/community support and financially planning for hired help.\r\n   * I want to nurture others and support their development, without entirely forfeiting my own access to nurturance and development.  This is a major beef I have with the nuclear family model as we currently know it—the two adults are isolated, overextended, and under-supported.  How might we solve this as a family?\r\n* Monogamy/polyamory: let's talk\r\n   * I’m looking for a stable home life, life-mate bond, and economic partnership, founded on an expectation of continuity and permanence, that hopefully doesn’t ban me from enjoying physical affection and intimacy in my friendships.\r\n   * That means I would prefer a “monogamish” variant of ENM with the ideal reader of this doc (hey there, gorgeous!)…\r\n   * …but I would consider going monog if said partner needs it and is otherwise a bullseye match.\r\n   * Poly with me is smooth sailing if you're on board.\r\n      * I have nine years of experience with ENM.\r\n      * I've fully or partially read several of the standard poly texts.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n      * Compersion comes naturally to me.  (Thank you, voyeurism kink?)  I can't remember a single time when I've felt romantically jealous of or threatened by a metamour.\r\n   * Meeting the right life partner matters more to me than filtering for ENM seekers.\r\n* I've survived much adversity in my life, and I've put tremendous effort toward post-traumatic growth.  My true peers are others with a rich history of character-building experiences.  [1, 2, 3]\r\n* My attachment style is Earned Secure.\r\n   * This tends to fail toward Disorganized or Anxious in the absence of reasonable emotional safety.\r\n   * I do mean “reasonable emotional safety” in a literal sense.  Treat me well and we're okay.\r\n   * I have survived severely abusive relationships, and I know what to look out for.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\r\nCalling all nuanced thinkers\r\n“The ancient oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks.\r\nIt is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.”\r\n—Socrates\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's my favorite quote from Civilization V.  😉\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual and emotional honesty take the cake in my value system.\r\n\r\n\r\nListening to diverse viewpoints, trying to empathize with others, sussing out the truth, sitting quietly with the finiteness of our knowledge, forming a responsible and carefully considered worldview, and holding skepticism toward our own biases are all deeply important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI profoundly disagree with the existence of yard signs that show a pre-bundled collection of political slogans, even when I support each of the stated positions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I read Bowling Alone, I became a dues-paying member of Braver Angels and volunteered with BA as an event organizer and host.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy ideal partner would fit Paul Graham's description of an “accidental moderate”.  The more you wonder about and vibe with life experiences outside your own, the more I'd like to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThematically related.  Swiped from an Astral Codex Ten post about the regulatory\r\nchallenges facing bioengineered mouth flora that promise to eliminate cavities.\r\n\r\nYe olde ambitions\r\nI want to net eight figures (or more) over my lifetime by being amazing at tech and startups with reasonably prosocial impact.  This has been a long throughline in my life.  I taught myself to code at age eight.  Then I skipped college and went straight to work at Google, at age twenty.  In the ten years since, I've been building my business acumen, inhaling technical knowledge, developing a grand unified theory of engineering productivity, and attempting startups intermittently.  None of them have taken off yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event of a wealth explosion: in addition to buying a lot of mosquito nets for charity, I'd like to create a beautiful, rejuvenating dwelling space that's quiet and green and close to a city and looks like something off Pinterest.  Maybe not just for me-and-mine—maybe an eco-village?  A giant attic in which to keep brilliant neurodivergent artists and inventors?\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurodivergent liberation, beginning with my own, is a much bigger theme for me than status games.  I get a bad feeling in my gut about win/lose status games (though I'm admittedly driven to seek others' admiration and fondness)—but I like living authentically and healthfully, and nurturing the same in the people whose lives I touch.  To the extent that those goals require resource abundance and social capital, they tend to get folded into conversations about status.  That can lead to some inner confusion, since I do have both a functioning limbic brain and a conscience that's skeptical as hell of it.  However, I'm clear that what I fundamentally want is the freedom and power to reject toxic environments (physical, social, and professional) and to design a bespoke life suited to my and my loved ones' needs.  Wealth, to me, means being able to breathe, even if my needs require resource investment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven with a more ordinary amount of capital in hand, I'm still serious about nesting as a primary life project.  Home should be a delightful place.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a young child, I wanted to be an “inventor”.  I wanted to create contact lenses that would grant eyesight to the blind, and a dynamic converter that would project a cartoonish force field using energy absorbed from local sound waves.  I've tabled those particular projects, but their spirit lives in me still.  🥼🧪🧑‍🔬🔧\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel curious about working with something more tangible than pixels and bytes.  Materials science sparks my imagination.  Could I create an eco-friendly material that beats plastic at its own game, at a lower price point?  Something that biodegrades into clean air, let's say?\r\n\r\n\r\nI also feel curious about moving deeper into the business side of the world.  I've been encouraged to contact leading MBA schools and ask whether they'd consider me as a nontraditional applicant.  The idea keeps boomeranging back into my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I can still make something of these dreams without disappearing entirely into the pages of Baby Blues.  If it takes time, it takes time.  It would be lovely to land in the kind of relationship where we can plan across decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI assure you, fam, I am a highly qualified Superloser.\r\nSome art I've made\r\nI took these photographs.  I take a lot of photographs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs any professional photographer will tell you, snapping photos is a perfect example of Superlosing.  You attempt a hundred shots in earnest to capture a single great one, and then you go home proud, with a camera roll full of 99% duds.  This is considered a good ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was sixteen, I collaborated with my best friend to compose a progressive-metal instrumental track.  The piece was stylistically inspired by a band called “Animals as Leaders”, which you should definitely check out.  We titled our track Amaranthine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write poems.\r\nIf I like you, I will write you a poem.\r\nBem's androgyny, y'all\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe more I look at that mise-en-place, the more I wonder\r\nwhat she plans to do with the ladle.  Defense, maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nSandra Bem’s androgyny framework is the actual bee’s knees.  Here’s the rundown:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are culturally tagged “masculine” and “feminine” modalities of thought, feeling, and behavior.\r\nA fully developed human has mindfully cultivated both in themself through a combination of deliberate self-work and acquiring varied life experiences.\r\nThat human is the Avatar of shitty gender constructs, bending all the elements at once:\r\ncompetence and warmth, yin and yang, nurturance and agency, assertiveness and receptivity…\r\nAccording to Dr. Bem, they've risen to the rank of “androgynous”, the peak of human potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Bem came up with this idea and developed research tools to measure people on a two-axis system of “femininity” and “masculinity”, with the really cool people landing in the upper-right quadrant, high on both scales.  Those folks can display “situational appropriateness” across a wide variety of contexts, either by switching modes or by blending both modes at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nBem’s androgyny feels like a cousin to two of my other favorite ideas in philosophy, which are the golden mean (watching out for “too much” and “too little” in literally all things) and Hegelian dialectics (thesis/antithesis/synthesis).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, am I masculine?  That’s a very solid “yes-and”.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the final minutes of an attempt at a sub-5:30 mile, I prayed to the departed ghost of my Marine grandfather for the strength to endure and exceed my body's limits—and I clocked in at 5:24, shaking, on the verge of heaving, but triumphant.  I'm excellent with technical systems.  I achieved the competitive rank of Onyx in Halo 5.  For projects that really matter (and some that don't), I plan carefully using numbers and spreadsheets.  I lift weights.  The old Teddy Roosevelt quote stirs my heart and lights a fire in me.  I like making my loved one feel safe and protected and provided-for (so long as I'm not over-parentified by my peer).\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve also cried unabashedly at the songs in Steven Universe, which I purchased season-by-season in its entirety.  The lyrics of “Love Like You”—if you know, you know.  Visually, I'm obsessed with color.  I want to be aesthetically beautiful and to create beauty around me.  I'm captivated by sensations and will visibly surrender to joy when I look out over the hills, snuggle up under a soft blanket, or take the first bite of a good meal.  As I mentioned earlier, my special interest (other than deck-builders and approximately every subject in nonfiction) is relationships and feelings.  I'm a cat whisperer and absolutely melt for kitties, baby talk and all.  And I want someone to kiss me like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you spend time on the parts of Reddit where this\r\nsort of image gets posted, please send me a message.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could be an appropriate partner for (among other sorts) a cishet AFAB who is herself holistically developed, and honors and craves the same breadth and depth in her male partner.  Historically, most of my partners have been bi+ and neurodivergent, so the gender thing took a back seat to a grounded notion of compatibility and like-mindedness.  In any case, if you like what you see, I would be glad to hear from you.  Just understand that policing my “masculinity” would be grounds to end the relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this has bearing on family life!\r\nCatch me teaching grit, agency, and excellence to my future kids, hopefully by modeling these myself.\r\nAlso catch me spoiling those kiddos with bottomless emotional attention, attunement, and co-regulation—which I expect to model just as much in my relationship with my spouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nI greatly value some kind of bend toward Bem’s androgyny in others.\r\nIn AMABs, that usually looks like culturally conspicuous EQ and warmth (with their agency and excellence taken for granted by society).\r\nIn AFABs, it usually looks like culturally conspicuous agency and excellence (with their EQ and warmth taken for granted by society).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCan we please teach this to all preschoolers, regardless of sex?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more hot take:\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve developed a view that temperament and neurotype really are what gender is cracked up to be.  People empirically differ in their essential, embodied natures—meaning blank slatism is false—but the pink/blue bucket system is a stain on our culture.  Temperament and neurotype show uncountable natural variations, giving rise to “endless forms most beautiful and strange” among individuals.  People are best bucketed by their contextually relevant distinctions (I call them “CoRDs”), which vary completely from one context to the next.  Reproductive sex class is almost never a CoRD, unless we're actually talking about intercourse or family planning!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth about a person’s talents, instincts, and proclivities dwells in that person, and the optimally developed version of that person is bespoke and exists independently of cultural archetypes.  I don't know, nor do I expect ever to know, what traits statistically correlate with reproductive sex class at a population level in a truly culture-fair society.  I do know that if you're dealing with (for example) a young Norah Vincent, who, as an AFAB child in the early 1970's, persisted doggedly in wearing jeans and climbing trees despite every imaginable social pressure to the contrary, then you love and embrace that lil’ lesbian tomboy from the bottom of your heart.  And for goodness's sake, can we please make heroes rather than martyrs of our highly sensitive AMAB children?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this means for parenting is: I’m going to let my kids show me what their natural talents and interests are, and then I’m going to nurture those without too much editorializing.  (Yes, rooting out bias and subtle influences is a hard problem, but still.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe user selects negative-one genders, and the fortress bursts into flames.\r\nCase study: BayHouseWarming\r\nIn 2021, as I was moving from Seattle back to the Bay Area, I tried founding a group house with 4–6 ambitious residents from among my friend group.  I affectionately called this project the Bay House.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy vision was to gather folks who would positively peer-pressure each other to achieve their dreams more proactively, in a warm and nurturing environment where we all enjoyed one another, shared meals, kept up with each other's lives, and did activities together.  (Looking back three years later, I recognize this as a variation of “family”, which I now call one of my core values.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI shot for the moon and landed in the treetops: I succeeded in establishing the house with a total of 3 residents, plus a fourth who visited for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took on sole responsibility for furnishing our new nest—everything from budgeting to design to logistics.  When one housemate's parents came to see the place, they pulled me aside and said, “You put all this together?  This is not some bachelor-pad setup.  This is a grown-up house,” nodding with a raised brow.  That's still one of my favorite compliments I've ever received.\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to plan and host a housewarming party, hoping to knit together different parts of my friend group and establish the house as a social venue.  Naturally, I named the party “BayHouseWarming”.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still have the planning sheet in my personal archives:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIs this “masculine” or “feminine”?  You tell me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unchecked items got done in time; I just never went back to check the checkboxes.  By then, the list had served its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also made this document to help track food prep.  It's an early example of what I now call [pun redacted]—my personal survival tool for C.W.N. (cooking while neurodivergent).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the rest of the story in photos:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe appetizers turned out delicious.\r\n(The cans are all soft drinks, most with low sugar.\r\nI'm a lifelong teetotaler; all my parties are dry.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI make frequent efforts to share my love of hot sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nReady for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake it double.  (Or sextuple.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNametags, just as the sheet foretold!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe crew's all here.  The whiteboard mounted over the hearth was lots of fun—\r\nevery time a visitor came over, something new would appear on it.\r\nWe got poems, lewd drawings, people's hopes and dreams, more lewd drawings…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA chessboard is to some of my friends as a paper bag is to cats.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring the chess match, one of the spectators started\r\ndrawing the other guests on paper plates.  I have no\r\nidea where the palette came from.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMain course: vegan chili and cornbread.\r\nI'm a “reducetarian” myself, and it's always easier to plan\r\nmeals for large groups by defaulting to a vegan menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt was the kind of dinner you'd want to eat outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is why.  The view from the back deck that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs intended, the party set the stage for many afternoons of four-square…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n…with the good ol' crew…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n…plus many evenings of Telestrations…\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t…which got pretty wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the Telestrations booklet responsible for those reactions.\r\nWilliam (far left above) saw only page 4, then drew page 5, and was VERY pleased with my guess on page 6.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSex and other wonderful things\r\nIs it bad form to talk about sex in a dating doc?\r\n\r\n\r\n…No.\r\n\r\n\r\n…Maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's settle for a middle ground.  Here are some books I've read attentively:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Magnificent Sex: Lessons from Extraordinary Lovers by Peggy J. Kleinplatz and A. Dana Ménard\r\n   * (HIGHLY recommend!)\r\n* Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski\r\n* She Comes First by Ian Kerner\r\n* Rethinking Sex by Christine Emba\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll save most of my steamy shares for a later time.  Here's just one for now:\r\nI have a strong track record of creating a reverse orgasm gap in my relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're my sweetie, I will learn all the ways you like to be touched, both in and out of bed.  😘\r\nI care a lot about this!  In a fully selfish sense, I come alive by making you come alive.  There’s nothing better than a partner's joy.\r\nOn good terms with my ex\r\nAt 23, I met and fell in love with a very charming human, who is now working on her own dating doc, which will get a solid endorsement from me.  [UPDATE: Here it is.]\r\nThat relationship continued for about eight years.  We lived together for four of those years, then moved apart.\r\nFinally, we decided that we had irreconcilable differences and it wouldn't make sense for us to marry.  Our paths have disentangled somewhat, and we’re currently in a cooling-off period of low contact, but this person is still like family to me and to my relatives.\r\nExpect her to continue playing a role in my life!  She’ll likely appear at family gatherings in the future.  It’s possible she’ll be “Auntie Alicia” to my kids.\r\nHow I'm searching\r\nUsing dateme.directory, I ran a database query for every F and NB doc worldwide.  (My data cutoff was 2024-04-14.)  Then I carefully read all 130 of them, skipping one.  That part took a total of 10 hours.  I built a spreadsheet as I went, recording my feelings about each doc on a dual 7-point scale—separately measuring the strength of my positive response and the strength of my negative response.  Both scales work like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n7—overwhelmingly present\r\n6—clearly present\r\n5—weakly present\r\n4—ambivalent or unclear\r\n3—weakly absent\r\n2—clearly absent\r\n1—overwhelmingly absent\r\n\r\n\r\nI recorded my data in normalized form so I could write relational queries.\r\nThen I wrote a query to generate a bubble chart visualizing the frequencies of different score pairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I look at the size of the 5/6, 6/6, and 7/6 bubbles,\r\na certain Taylor Swift song starts playing in my head.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also wrote a query to grab the data records forming the lower-right portion of the chart (high positive scores, low negative scores) and sort them in a certain way.  That tells me which docs to revisit at length.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom there, intuition takes the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you get an outreach message from me, know that a lot of forethought and appreciation went into it, and I've been spending lots of quality time with your writing!  😊\r\nContact info\r\nIf anything in this doc has inspired you to say hello, pen a spicy response, ask me out on a date, or just be my pal, you're warmly invited to do either of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Text me at two zero six, two two five, seven zero four two\r\n* Email me at: langhisc at [DELETE THIS] gmail [DELETE THIS] dot com\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you try one method and you don't get a response, please try the other.  As long as this doc is published and visible, I'll try to acknowledge every message I receive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for making it this far!  Have a blessed rest of your existence, dear reader.  ✨"

That they made this \"hang out with your friends BB-8 and Chewy\" rather than straight-up cult indoctrination into the Jedi religion is unforgivable\r\n2. “You miss NaN of the shots you don’t take”. Wait no that’s not right, it’s not 0/0, it’s n/0 – “You miss Infinity of the shots you don’t take”. Wait that’s not right either, it’s actually just n/n, AKA 100%, AKA the conventional saying was right all along 😛\r\n3. How open should I be with various friends in various contexts? Where are the lines between sharing, exploring, over-sharing, holding things back in ways that create fun tension?\r\n4. Well shit, now that we finished the climb, we’re on top of a fin of rock with cliffs on both sides – how do we get down?\r\n5. AI for epistemics is great and all, but what about AI for coordination and political stability?\r\n6. Quintal voicings on piano! And the “harmonic experimentation” sitting down at the piano that led me to “discover” them\r\n7. Textbook, you say that isometric mappings are linear, and you show that they preserve sums. But what about scalar multiples?!? How can you just not address that at all?!?\r\nStuff I’m into\r\nOutdoors/exercise\r\nI go backpacking in the Sierras a few times a year – I’ve recently gotten into hiking up from the east side, going off trail, and wandering around the basins, ~as described in this excellent book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI go climbing in the gym and outside, often sport at Mount Saint Helena and occasionally trad in the Sierras.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love mountain biking when I’m back home in Tucson, but I haven’t bought a bike yet in the Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy hiking, tennis, soccer, Spikeball, and weightlifting.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn most days I do one of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation etc.\r\nI do concentration meditation most days, and I’m in a weekly circling/relatefulness group. I used to go on meditation retreats fairly often but recently I’ve been going on noble silence solo backpacking trips in the Sierras, which have been excellent.\r\nMusic\r\nI play jazz-adjacent piano. I rehearse with my band every week. Here we are playing one of my tunes, and here we are playing my arrangement of one of my favorite pop songs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy jamming with friends and singalongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m trying to accomplish in the world\r\nAI is rapidly getting smarter, and I expect it to have a huge impact on the course of world events in the coming years. My main professional goal is to make that impact as positive as possible. I’m pursuing that goal by working at Elicit, a startup that’s building an AI research assistant to do literature review. I hope that AI-assisted research can give everyone access to high quality evidence and reasoning, and help us work together to make wise decisions, agreements, contracts, and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelatedly, I’m an Effective Altruist:\r\n1. I used to work on alleviating global poverty\r\n2. I’m ~vegetarian\r\n3. I’m into some weird subcultural stuff e.g. date-me docs 😛\r\n\r\n\r\nUs\r\nWhat I’m looking for in a relationship\r\nI’m looking for a very long-term, marriage or marriage-adjacent life partner\r\n\r\n\r\nKids?\r\nIn short: probably but flexible\r\n\r\n\r\nI can imagine living a good and fulfilling life without kids with the right partner; I can also imagine living a good and fulfilling life with kids with the right partner. The latter feels more straightforward and easier to imagine.\r\nMono vs. poly?\r\nIn short: ~mono\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve done both and both have worked for me. I lean towards ~monogamy but with flexibility so it’s not a disaster if after some years we go through a spot of not being attracted to each other. Strict monogamy also OK, poly OK with the right person. I am very non-jealous, FYI\r\nPersonal qualities\r\n1. I’m very loyal, I stick with friends and partners. I try hard to make things work in relationships. I’d like you to be pretty loyal as well. On the flip side I hope we can both stay loyal to ourselves and only move forward with deepening a relationship if it’s the right thing for each of us\r\n2. I’m pretty honest – I’m ~never actively dishonest, and I’m more on the side of over-honesty and over-sharing than keeping things to myself. I need you to be pretty honest and ~never actively dishonest or deceptive. I’d be quite interested in an excruciatingly open/honest relationship, though I’m also happy with normal levels of openness and honesty\r\n3. Relatedly, I’m quite interested in exploring my and other peoples’ emotions/hearts/souls. I’m in the middle of my journey on this one. 5 years ago I was below average at feeling, understanding, and working with feelings. I think I’m now roughly average, I’d like to be extremely good\r\n4. I’m pretty smart. I know about lots of different domains and I’m also pretty good at figuring stuff out. I’d like you to also be pretty smart\r\n5. I’m extremely high-openness. Probably won’t work unless you’re also fairly high-openness.\r\n6. I think I take in and interact with the world in my own weird, surprising, and beautiful way and I think I bring lots of joy to how I interact with myself, others, and the world. Looking for someone who does the same but in their own way\r\n7. I’m trying to accomplish some stuff in the world. It’s not important to me that you are, exactly, but I tend to get along better with people who are\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\nAt datebenrachbach@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to just send me a quick ping to take a look at your dating doc/dating profile :)"

Someone who wants to co-create a beautiful partnership where we can support and inspire each other in our missions to create a better world while overcoming life’s inevitable challenges, building relationships/communities, and enjoying life.\nAge: Born 1992\nKids: 65% yes but 95% that I won’t get kids in the next two years (until end of 2026).\nGender/Sexuality: Straight man.\nRelationship structure: Monogamish.\nLocation:\nLondon: ~ 6 months/year until at least mid-2026.\nUS/Bay area: ~2 months/year.\nAnywhere in the world (but preference for strategically relevant places): ~4 months/year\nKindly don’t share this publicly!\nTable of content\nAbout me\nMy journey\nMy decade vision\nFacts\nAbout you\nQualities and tendencies\nImportant stuff\nFacts and nice-to stuff\nAbout us\nNext steps\nAppendix\nBig-5 personality\nAbout me\nMe with some of my friends in London. (2023)\nALT\nI’m a co-founder of Impact Academy - a non-profit that runs ambitious educational programs to enable young people to use their careers to solve some of the most pressing problems and contribute to a better future. I also work as a coach for impact-driven people. I enjoy communal living and have lived in multiple group houses -  including one with a six-month-old baby, but am also open to other forms of communal living.\nBefore that, I did a bunch of different things throughout my life. I trained as a medical doctor, did biosecurity research at Stanford that might have contributed a tiny bit to the prevention of pandemics, co-founded Effective Altruism Denmark, co-authored a book during my undergrad, and created a course for 1000+ students.\nI’m also a mediocre salsa dancer and a non-terrible singer (who loves to sing Alicia Keys songs). On the more adventurous side, I've spent four months in Nepal and hitchhiked from Copenhagen to Budapest.\nMy journey\nDue to luck and a great teacher, I had a wake-up call when I was 16 and I realized that I was on a bad trajectory. I started to work on forming my values, character, and lifestyle to take care of myself and lead a more meaningful and altruistic life (such as supporting refugees). As I was deciding on my degree, I considered many different options (from social science to philosophy) as I’m very curious (and still am! 🙂). However, I narrowed it down to medicine and psychology and eventually decided on medicine as I thought it was the most promising way of understanding the human condition and thus help others the most. Especially those who needed it the most. This was mainly driven by altruism, curiosity, and unnoticed guilt.\nDuring the first years of my undergrad, I co-authored a book with a Norwegian author who had inspired me when I was younger. The book we wrote together was on how to study effectively and I was later hired to create and teach a course for all medical students at my university. I eventually decided to pivot away from this because I believed effective altruism and global health were more important (not an easy decision!). I had several existential crises and almost dropped out to join Effective Giving when it was starting out. However, I decided to finish the degree and build the EA community in Denmark (which I did for three years next to med school). During these later years, I also started finding “my people,” with whom I built deep friendships that last to this day, frequently bringing me joy and gratitude.\nTowards the end of med school, I ran a career experiment in biosecurity at Stanford University, SSI, and the US CDC for two years. My research was on mortality monitoring using EuroMOMO because I predicted it’d be useful in pandemics (pre-covid). This included living in an incredible group house with entrepreneurs in Palo Alto and trying coaching. These experiences introduced me more seriously to entrepreneurship and coaching - both of which I’ve been pursuing since 2020. In 2022, I had the fortune of meeting some awesome and like-minded people who had a similar vision so we co-founded Impact Academy.\nMe facilitating a workshop at a conference. (2019)\nALT\nMy decade vision\nI have three main ambitions for this decade (until December 31st, 2030):\nMake Impact Academy a world-class organization that runs ambitious educational programs to enable people to use their careers to solve some of the most pressing problems and contribute to a better future.\nFind the other half of an altruistic couple - a \"romantic co-founder\". Someone who wants to co-create a beautiful relationship where we can support each other in our missions to create a better world, grow, and create beautiful experiences. This could involve starting a family.\nBe a coach for some of the most impactful individuals and enable them to enhance their lifetime impact, become their best selves, and care for themselves and their loved ones.\nFacts\nHeight:\n183 cm\nAge:\n31 (1992)\nKids:\n65% yes: I’ll give it 65% that I will get kids at some point and 95% that I won’t get kids in the next two years (until 2026). Since I was 18, I’ve felt that the world is my family and haven’t had a need or drive to have my own kids. For several years, I wanted to adopt, but now I think that isn’t the best way to improve the world. Recently, that shifted for me and if I find a partner, I’m open to it (but not in the next two years) if it doesn’t significantly detract from our ability to serve the world.\nGender/Sexuality:\nStraight: I identify as a man, and I’m attracted to women.\nRelationship structure:\nMonogamish: Historically, I’ve found it difficult to find enough time for one partner and don’t have a need for multiple partners. I’m open to my partner seeing others if that makes her happy.\nLocation:\nOxford/London until at least mid-2026: 10-30% remote work is possible for that period. Open to moving after that (e.g., to the US) but I hope to set up a base (including a group house) with a partner in London.\nReligion/spirituality:\nAgnostic/atheist: I’m deeply grateful for the scientific method and the Scout Mindset. You might be somewhat religious or spiritual, but you’re more likely to identify as Atheist or Agnostic. That said, I have some sense of spirituality and have benefitted from some aspects of religion (especially secular Buddhism), and I hope you have too.\nMe at a salsa camp - almost feels like a different life now (2019).\nALT\nLinks\nHere are some of the books I’ve read throughout my life Goodreads (only a small subset of the books).\nHere’s my website.\nMe finishing a Spartan race with one of my best friends, Paul. (2021)\nALT\nAbout you\nBelow is my current hypothesis for what I’m looking for in a partner. If most of this resonates, then we might be a great match, though (in all honesty) you may be too good for me. 😊 Don’t worry about “ticking all of the boxes” - the most important thing is that most of these resonate with you. I’d much rather that you err in favor of reaching out (you’re probably awesome) than think that you “don’t tick enough boxes”.\nQualities and tendencies\nImportant stuff\nWe will likely be a good match if most of the following qualities are important to you.\nEthical and on an ambitious mission to make the world better.\nYou have a drive to make the world a better place and have used this as your guiding star during most of your important life decisions. You have engaged with several moral theories, and you likely find some form of consequentialism the most plausible, though you appreciate other theories. You might be particularly devoted to the betterment of future generations or think that the alleviation of suffering is more important than the promotion of happiness. You’ve probably been inspired by Effective Altruism (though may have significant reservations), but you’re at least positive about the core principles of wanting to improve the world and using reason and evidence.\nIntellectual and curious.\nYou find great joy in understanding things by using a scientific mindset. Holding accurate beliefs is much more important than being right to you. You’ve changed your mind on important issues, which led to you taking action, too. Even though it was weird or unconventional. You enjoy trying new things, are likely an avid reader, and find long (3 hours+) conversations enjoyable.\nGrowth-oriented and perhaps even a bit wise.\nGrowing as a person and becoming wiser is important to you. For many years, you’ve probably done things such as i) reflecting on your values, strengths, and weaknesses, ii) trying to optimize/systematize your life, and iii) cultivating virtues such as humility and kindness. You may have read books like Man’s Search For Meaning, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, and Peak and have habits like meditation, journaling, and tracking. You probably also love facilitating this for others.\nGlobally-minded (Cosmopolitan)\nYou’re globally minded and care about global affairs - from the more substantive and difficult to the lighthearted. For example, you’ll happily engage in a discussion on the relationship between the US and China and appreciate cultivating friendships with people from different cultures.\nLoving and affectionate yet strong and emotionally stable\nYou’re caring and attentive to the needs of others. You’d sense whether I’m happy or sad and make me feel cared for via your words and actions (and emojis ☺️). Bonus points if one of your love languages is physical touch. That being said, you have a fairly deep sense of who you are and some level of self-compassion. Consequently, you don’t let others’ perspectives and needs crowd out yours so you can set boundaries and express disagreements when you think it’s right.\nProfessionally, you’re likely to have tried many different things that involved bringing out the best in people and were deeply guided by the things above. You’re passionate and (at least mildly) obsessive about what you do. Perhaps you are (or have been):\nA social entrepreneur\nCoach\nEducator\nBuilder of communities.\nKids: You’re not in a hurry to get kids (definitely not before 2026).\nFacts and nice-to stuff\nPerhaps some of the following hold true for you, too.\nAge:\nIdeal: 25-35. Acceptable: 22-40\nHeight:\nIdeal: 163-180 cm. 160-185 cm.\nDiet:\nVegetarian/vegan unless you have good arguments not to be.\nOther things that are less important\nAbout us\nAt the highest level, I want us to co-create a beautiful partnership where we can support and inspire each other in our missions to create a better world while learning, building relationships/communities, and enjoying life. This will require experimentation, work, and direct communication.\nBased on my previous relationships, I’d love to do some of these things together:\n💓 Supporting each other through the most important ups and downs in life. Be it celebrating big and small wins or holding compassionate space for each other's imperfections.\n🖥️ Co-working. I expect both of us to be at least moderately obsessed with what we do, which makes co-working very valuable and deeply meaningful - this also works remotely.\n🫂 Getting to know each other deeply and creating a “shared language”. From having long conversations about the books we’ve enjoyed the most and what we’re doing professionally to coming up with cute idiosyncratic words and knowing each other’s journeys intimately.\n📕 Co-reading a book. I really enjoy sitting closely while reading a book. This also works remotely. Perhaps we’ll co-author a book one day.\n🤗 Cuddling and being close when we’re together (perhaps one of your love languages is physical touch).\n🎤 Singing songs (as mentioned, I’m a sucker for Alicia Keys but very happy to sing other songs) and improvised dancing 💃🏽.\n📝 Writing blog posts together, learning about important concepts or skills (I’m upskilling on AI these days), or co-hosting events such as intentional reading, lighting talks, yearly goal-setting, or world-building.\nThis is a picture from an intentional reading event I co-hosted. (2023)\nALT\nPast relationships\nI’m grateful for the previous romantic relationships I’ve been part of, and I think all of them are wonderful people. However, they didn’t work for some important reasons, and it’s valuable to learn from them. Here are some reasons why it didn’t work (work in progress).\nWhat I felt was missing (in some or all of the relationships):\nNot enough altruism and/or dedication.\nFelt I was the one who was taking the initiative and helping us grow\nNot being into intense intellectual conversations.\nWhat they felt was off (across some or all previous partners):\nI worked too much, didn’t prioritize them enough, and tended to talk too much about our work instead of their feelings.\nFelt I had too high expectations of them, which caused some anxiety.\nThem not liking long distance and/or us moving for professional reasons. I don’t love long-distance, but I can be happy while being apart if the initial base is there.\nNext steps\nIf this resonates deeply with you, please reach out to me on email (sebastian@sebastianschmidt.world). I appreciate directness! 😊\nAppendix\nBig-5 personality\nOpenness: 90%\nConscientiousness: 93%\nExtraversion: 75%\nAgreeableness: 80%\nNeuroticism: 20%"

I immigrated from Haiti in 2018. I have lived and went to college in New York and have been living in the South Bay for over 2 years. I am a sister, a cousin, a godmother, and a friend to many. I value family and friendships a lot and a continuous goal of mine is to maintain and nurture these relationships. I consider myself an introvert but can be outgoing in the right settings and with the right people.\nHobbies\nI like cooking and love trying new recipes, at least every month. They don’t always turn out how I want to but it’s always a good time and a fun experience (see my failed attempt at baking croissants and eclairs below)\nI lived on island for most of my life so I love the beach and feeling the warm sand in between my toes. I am also a sucker for a beautiful sunset and will always stop to admire and snap a few pictures (see below).\nI have tried many sports such as basketball, tennis, boxing, swimming, muay thai, and kickboxing. I’m currently doing the latter. My mantra is to try some things at least once. This applies to sports and other aspects of my life.\nWork, Volunteering\nI am software engineer now (I studied CS and Accounting) and I have dreams/goals to venture into other careers that are fulfilling and meaningful to me.\nI have mostly volunteered within the tech industry either as a mentor or a website developer for non-profit organizations in the Bay Area.\n💃🏾Things that excite me:\nFinding the solution to an implementation\nBoard Games (social deception are my favorites)\nVolunteering\nSpending time with loved ones\nTraveling\nFostering and Mentoring\nThings that make me laugh:\nBad jokes\nPuns\nDad jokes\nA bit of vulnerability here:\nHonestly this Date Me Doc alone is a huge step out of my comfort zone. If we were to meet on a dating app or out in the wild, I wouldn’t be the type to talk a lot so sharing this much is already a a huge step. Writing this was hard because I don’t think I have ever thought about myself to that extent. BUT writing this has also been nice. I love the person I am and am becoming.\n💘 Love compatibility\nMarriage is ultimately the end goal and would love to have children, with the right person.\nI show love through words of affirmation and act of service. I can be an overthinker so reassurance is greatly appreciated.\nIdeally, you are 26-42, with no children, but want some day. You, share some of my values, can be vulnerable, kind to others, caring, curious and open minded, enjoy deep talk, fun and playful to be around. You have goals and are actively working on them. You’ve seen or are seeing a therapist. You are aware of things that needs to be worked on. You get my weird humor.\n🚫 Non Negotiables\nNon LGBTQ+ Ally\nRacist\nConforms to patriarchal views of women in the workforce/home\nPromised Pictures:\nBeautiful sunset from SF (photo refuses to stay upright :’)\nALT\nFailed attempt at baking croissants (1)\nALT\nFailed attempt at baking croissants (2)\nALT\n☺️ Interested?\nIf this resonates with you at all or know a friend, contact me at neissa@dorsinville.com"

If you resonate with what you read, let’s chat or meet up! psaniko@gmail.com or @akimbow on Telegram. If you know someone who you think might be a fit, feel free to send them this doc.\r\n  \r\n\r\nBasics\r\nMan, straight\r\nMonogamous\r\n32 years old (1992)\r\nBerlin, flexible\r\nGerman and English\r\n190cm tall\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies & Interests\r\nEnergy: I’d consider myself ambivert, i.e. I enjoy meeting new people and doing activities in large groups but also need a lot of down time (which can be with close friends). I had periods where I filled my week with salsa, bachata, acrobatics, HIIT, and scuba - and apnoe diving but also ones where I tinkered with a rocket layout for a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouch: I greatly enjoy cuddling and massages (recently did 100h of learning Thai massage and am loving it). Physical touch is my primary love language by a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nSports: I love being active and pushing my body. The past 7 years I’ve enjoyed Crossfit and olympic weightlifting a lot. With friends I sometimes do AcroYoga or go hiking.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharity: I discovered Effective Altruism 11 years ago and it’s become a big part of my life. Most of my friends consider themselves EAs and I enjoy engaging in big questions about our future. It has shaped my career and worldview and while working in IT and finance I was lucky to be able to donate large parts of my salary to charities and causes I believe in.\r\n\r\n\r\nVeggie: I’ve been vegan for 10 years. I rarely make veggie exceptions but eating meat is a non-negotiable for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks: Super into sci-fi and fantasy epics (Brandon Sanderson, Pierce Brown, Andy Weir, etc). I also enjoy non-fiction books about history, psychology, economics, and the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames: I almost exclusively play co-op games with friends. Something about strategizing and adventuring with friends in vast worlds is super satisfying to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\nI’m looking for the classic partner in crime. I’m done with short term dating around and would like to build a long lasting relationship. I want to live out my cheesy, romantic side while at the same time knowing I can rely on my partner in whatever life throws at us.\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle: For me that means a monogamous relationship but I’m not strictly opposed to opening it up if that’s what we both want. \r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: I currently live in Berlin but I’m flexible w.r.t. moving in the future. I’ve lived in Hong Kong and the Bay Area before.\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I want kids and it’s a deal breaker if you can’t imagine this in your future. I’ve felt ready to be a dad for the past three years. Being a parent to me means sharing the work of childcare equally. I love working but would have no issues being a stay-at-home dad either.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther preferences: non-smoker, kind, curious, witty"

      "fullText": "﻿Date me (2025): Jacob\r\nHello! Here is a picture of me looking to the left of your screen. Position a bright light there if you want to bring the photo alive.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI’ve put more pics at the bottom. Now for some words  ↓ ↓ ↓\r\n\r\n\r\n(Did this guy really copy this over from a spreadsheet?)\r\n(This works better viewed landscape on phones)\r\n\r\n\r\nOk cool. Welcome to my document. Welcome to Zombo.com my date me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAge\r\n\t37\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tHastings, UK (this is ~1h20 – 2h from London by direct train)\r\n\tHeight\r\n\t178-179cm, depending what time you measure me. (We’re taller in the mornings.)\r\n\tJob\r\n\tI'm a freelance web analytics consultant. I've been doing this for over seven years (funnellinsights.com).\r\n\tRelationship type\r\n\tMonogamy or monogamish fit me well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've got experience in:\r\n- Long-term (up to 3 years+) monogamous\r\n- Long-term (3 years+) open relationship\r\n- Meaningful but non-exclusive connections with people who live a long way away; swapping visits\r\n- Steady friends with benefits\r\n- Mostly just friends unless we're feeling it\r\n\r\n\r\nI've never been married/engaged or done totally random hookups with someone I’ve barely talked to. I need some sort of connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf I really fall for someone, then I lean heavily in a monogamous direction, especially romantically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMyers-Briggs (yes I'm aware this is probably more akin to astrology than science, but some people find it indicative :))\r\n\tINTJ (but this varies owing to its inherently low reliability). \r\n\tBig Five\r\n\tAccording to the scientific gold standard of \"random internet test\", I'm high for Openness to new experience and Agreeableness, and moderately high for Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these are very mixed, however – I'm not prone to anxiety, but I do think quite a bit about the consequences of my actions. I take doing what I said seriously, and I’ve owned literally all areas of my work life entirely alone for over 6 years, but I'm more inclined to be a little disorganized. \r\n\r\n\r\nExtraversion here is also covering the fact I am the classic \"best one to one/very small groups, likes time to recharge\" introvert. But at parties/conferences, I actively approach and talk to new people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tInteresting link so even if you don’t like this profile, you get something out of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEvery Noise at Once\r\n\tWhat I'm looking for\r\n\tI'd like to find a long-term partner, and that's my main goal and my main priority. I want something I can invest in over the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also happy with just about any other kind of connection, including new friends. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs I live in Hastings, and most potential people live in London, I'd be happy to swap visits (I love showing Hastings to people) or meet halfway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tKids\r\n\tGenerally lean towards wanting them. Not a deal breaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThings I like to do\r\n\tI like:\r\n- Learning new things. I find so many things interesting it's hard to delimit it, but recurring themes are \r\ni) how and why do people do what they do? \r\nii) how did things and people come to be the way they are?\r\niii) what will the future look like?\r\n\r\n\r\nI also like taking an interest in things for the sake of it. Architecture, natural history, art, fossils etc etc. It doesn't have to be part of some grand narrative or project to understand the world. If I have a superpower, it’s knowing something about a lot of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome books I’ve liked: Superforecasting, Giovanni’s Room, Science Fictions, Permutation City, The Grapes of Wrath, Being Mortal, The Precipice, Flights, The Book of Trespass, Radical Markets, How Music Works, The Gift of Fear, Deep Work, How Pleasure Works, Moral Tribes, Moral Origins, A Short History of Nearly Everything, Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?, The Routledge Companion to Ethics, Stories of Your Life and Others, The Poetry of Sex, Wild Nights, Shroom, Intuition Pumps & Other Tools for Thinking, Writings on an Ethical Life, Three Men in a Boat\r\n\r\n\r\nSome podcasts I like: Astral Codex Ten, More or Less, Making Sense, Rationally Speaking (RIP), The Happiness Lab\r\n\r\n\r\n(Listing any of these does not imply a particular level of concordance with the conclusions of their authors/hosts.)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Hiking & wild camping. Every year I do one 1 week+ walk and I'll do numerous shorter self-guided walks with maps. I've got a knack for finding secret or little-visited places, even in the south-east of England. My longest so far was walking from Kosovo -> Montenegro -> Albania and back; I have a two week traverse of some islands in the Arctic Circle planned for 2024 [edit: done this! It was beautiful. And boggy], and another traverse of a mountain range in Spain. I take a lot of care to tailor what I do to my company, so don’t fear if these sound intense. I can be very happy doing a shorter amble through the countryside.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Friends and family. This is one of the best things about my life. I’ve developed a higher-than-average number of close friendships that I work actively to maintain, and I’ve developed new close friendships right into my 30s. I have an exceptionally good & close relationship with my immediate family. My closest friends are all highly agreeable, intelligent and curious people.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Running. Trying to get my half-marathon time down. It’s useful. You never know when you might need to run 20k to catch a bus.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Gigs and live music. I see a bunch of local/UK bands as well occasionally seeing something truly international. My taste is super broad but rock, metal, and folk would be my core genres.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Cooking. I make food from plants; I’ve been mostly vegan for 6+ years. I have like 100+ ingredients, I enjoy trying things that take work to get the ingredients/recipes for (I’ve translated a few). I like novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Learning French. I got my B1 certificate ages ago, currently in the push to get to B2 and I want to pass the exam by the end of 2025. I’m currently making every francophone I meet speak to me in French. So I’ve got about 35% more misunderstandings happening in my life than usual right now, sacré bleu !\r\n\r\n\r\n- Learning more about myself. I’m an analyst by trade. I collect data about myself every day, I journal, I try to improve and figure out my personal operating manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEA and rationalism\r\n\tI've got a decent background in both worlds. I’ve read a bunch of the core books, blogs and communities. I've been to multiple conferences and have a few friends in the space. My involvement peaked between 2015-2018 when I ran my local EA city group.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think \"EA adjacent\" best covers where I am now. I appreciate it a lot if people are interested in some of the core things that motivate these movements, even if they're not directly involved in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if EA/rationalist framings are your exclusive way of really encountering and thinking through things, I may not be what you're looking for. I am more fox than hedgehog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAbout you\r\n\tI find all of the following really attractive:\r\n- Curiosity. I mean a real ranging curiosity. The kind that stops you in your tracks, literally or figuratively. A sense that you really do just have to know more.\r\n- Independence. You have your own projects going on. You like to do your own things.\r\n- Playfulness. Silliness. The older I get the more value I put on this.\r\n- Interpersonal effort. Showing up, being thoughtful, being engaged. Another one I value so much more in myself and others as I’ve got older.\r\n- Rigour (when needed). Following a line of argument is really hot?\r\n- Intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for someone roughly between 26-42, although I'd consider people outside of this if it really made sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow to get in touch/ask questions etc\r\n\tExcellent idea (did I ever tell you that you have the best ideas?) \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat thing(s) caught your attention? What’s your date me, if you have one? I'd like to know!\r\n\r\n\r\nDrop me a message! jacobREMOVETHISANTISPAMTEXTarthurfunnell@gmail.com \r\n\tMore pictures!  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd shameless pic with a dog:"

We’ll celebrate when my climate fiction novel comes out, when you get your dream job, and when the kids win their Lego robotics competitions. We’ll learn and grow together and face hard times as a team. And through it all, we’ll feel secure in each other's support -- a rock-solid foundation from which to live our values and make (not find!) our happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this resonates, read on 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\n\r\n* Age: 42 (looking for someone +/-8-ish years)\r\n* Gender: Female\r\n* Location: I’m pretty tied to living in San Francisco at least half-time for the next ~14 years, til my kids are adults. Could live anywhere within ~3 hours the other half of the time.\r\n* Sexuality: For the purposes of this document, I’m looking for a partner who is a cis or trans man, or is nonbinary with masculine-leaning energy. Hence, “straight-ish” in the summary above, although I (also?) identify as queer. Sexuality is complicated! Happy to discuss more as we’re getting to know each other! 🙂\r\n* Monogamy? Am flexible on this (open to both monogamy and ethical non-monogamy). More details in the “About Us” section below.\r\n* Current Kids:\r\n   * I have 50% custody of my two children: Tuck, 6 years old, and Astra, 4 years old. We live in Potrero Hill.\r\n   * More than fine if you have kids too!\r\n  Taking the kids to see the elephant seals at Año Nuevo (2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Future Kids: I have a good store of frozen eggs, and would consider having another kid if the right partner came along in the next few years.\r\nMore about me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I've spent my career largely in progressive activism, fighting on urgent issues like climate change. I’ve also spent a lot of time in effective altruist circles. Now I’m working to try to leverage generative AI to increase the impact of nonprofits and mission-driven for-profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBack when I was running the corporate accountability nonprofit I founded (and had long hair!) (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’m a big ol’ nerd. I’ll solve that math puzzle or go down that Wikipedia rabbit hole with you – and if we’re not careful, I’ll start a book club or something in the process 😅\r\n* I’m very active, and community is central to my life. I organize writers retreats and hikes, play in pickleball tournaments, host games nights, you name it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy to help you get hooked on pickleball, too!\r\n\r\n\r\n* My coparent and I intentionally designed a platonic coparenting arrangement from the start; we’ve always had separate households, never were married or anything. I am currently in a secondary poly relationship, but finding a life partner is my priority – I’m open to anything on the monogamy-polyamory spectrum.\r\nWhat next?\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me at datetaren@gmail.com if you’re interested! If you don’t think you’re the right fit for me, but you have an idea of someone else who might be, I’d love for you to pass this profile along to them!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for reading,\r\nTaren\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. If you want to date a different Bay Area pickleball fanatic who cares about making the world a better place, check out my friend Julia’s date-me page as well!"

      "fullText": "﻿[Still looking for responses as of 12/07/25 - massively rewritten]\r\nBit cautious about identification/digital footprint, but I am happy to send pictures and identifying details via email (dmdgeorge24@gmail.com) if you write a few words about yourself!\r\nHi, I’m George and I’m a 24-year-old mathematics PhD student based in the UK. I’ll write down a few quick bullet points before writing some more detailed prose :) \r\nWhat I’m looking for, in brief!\r\n* Woman or non-binary person in their twenties in a compatible life stage (e.g. early career or PhD student).\r\n* Looking for a monogamous relationship, unfortunately not interested in polyamory. \r\n* Based in the UK, preferably England within a few hours of London, but this is flexible. If you are moving to the UK in the near future this works fine as well! I am unfortunately not interested in relationships that are likely to be online for an extended period.\r\n* A life-partner: I would not be interested in short-term or labelless relationships. A marriage would be nice for our families especially. That said, I am a slow-burn type person and willing to be very patient as a connection builds over months. If there are significant and immovable/hard-to-move barriers that prevent the relationship becoming long-term/life, then I may take this as a sign to move on. \r\n* Someone who would like to have children in the future, I have a very strong aspiration to be a father.\r\n* It “just works”. There is a bidirectional mutual intelligibility where we just get each-other. Conversation flows well. Everything is such that we can easily work through differences.\r\n* Someone who is open, non-judgemental and pleasant to be around. I am understanding of cases where the latter isn’t possible. \r\n* I have a lot of transgender/non-binary friends, so a partner should not have any issue with such people. \r\n* Someone who is tolerant of psychedelic use. Better yet, interested or actively engaged in psychedelic use. \r\n* Someone who is driven and trying to accomplish something. This doesn’t have to be work, it can be non-monetary-creative or charitable ventures. Has plans for the future. \r\n* Someone with whom I can discuss issues in a healthy way. Someone with whom a safe environment for emotional conversation is created. Unhealthy externalisation of anger/frustration in particular is a red flag.\r\n* Neurodivergence is especially welcomed, provided you are at peace with it and manage any difficulties healthily. \r\n* Someone with whom I can maintain a good balance of give and receive. \r\n* If long-distance, I’d prefer if someone was able to engage in deep conversation via text, and if this is not the case I think I’d like frequent voice calls.\r\nMe, in brief!\r\n* 6ft something, white man, beard, short hair, physically awkward\r\n* Completely irreligious \r\n* When comfortable, I am an extraordinarily calm presence. \r\n* I am driven and do not give up on accomplishing goals. \r\n* I try to say yes to new experiences unless I have a specific reason to say no. \r\n* I am very active in organising social events at my university.\r\n* I am quite good at “troubleshooting” and finding unconventional solutions to or explanations of things.\r\n* I don’t think any ask is too great of a friend or partner, provided the arrangement surrounding it is healthy. \r\n* I think I would not get on well with someone who had a strong sense that they “should” or “shouldn’t” do things purely out of social pressure. \r\n* I am a very intent listener and I ask plenty of exploratory questions. \r\n* I make active efforts to be optimistic but not toxically positive. \r\n* I am neurodivergent but I do not identify as neurodivergent (ask me about this! haha), I am against the idea of identity for myself in general. \r\n* I have been involved in BDSM dynamics in the past and fit in as a switch (though I have only ever acted as a dom in real life), however this is not a requirement for me and I won’t try to introduce elements of this unless interest is expressed mutually early on. I am not actively involved in that community anymore.\r\n* I have no physical type, come as you are\r\n\r\n\r\nIn more detail!\r\nAt the moment I’m in the midst of a self-improvement project. I’ve been trying to “diagnose and troubleshoot” issues I see in my interaction with other people. This has included improvements in physical expressivity, organising my thoughts on certain topics more clearly, trying to balance conversation dynamics, better active listening, and tidying my physical appearance. I believe I have come a good distance but this is an ongoing project and will likely be a factor in any romantic relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve had one previous long-term relationship and several online “talking stages”. As part of my self-improvement I’ve had a lot of thoughts on relationships and am very excited at the prospect of actualising them. As part of this I have a very strong ambition to become a father, having thought a lot about how I would take on my role in raising a child. \r\n\r\n\r\nPsychedelics have formed an important part of my self-development since my teens, and the surrounding community has allowed me to meet some of my closest friends. I have been very proactive in fostering such a community, being the vice-president of the Psychedelic Society at my university and running regular social events. Psychedelics have helped me develop my theory of mind, develop a stronger security in my self-control and analyse life problems. I have a blog on psychedelics which I try to write on, but I am actively seeking further dialogue with experienced explorers to develop these ideas. The psychedelic experience, at its most extreme, dissolves the distinction between the self and other. It may take some thought but one can sense a “unity” and synchronicity of themselves with those around them. I believe that this would be an utterly magical experience to share with a partner, being able to connect without barrier as pure consciousnesses. That said (!), I do not expect that a partner will be interested in taking psychedelics. I would like tolerance towards psychedelic usage and curiosity about the psychedelic experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very passionate about making an impact on people’s lives, especially in education. I have spent a lot of time giving advice to prospective university students, both in-person and on e.g. Reddit. I have also really enjoyed improving my teaching skills in-person as a teaching assistant. One of my biggest projects has been expanding ProofWiki’s coverage of functional analysis and measure theory: some of my writing appears on the first page of Google. This is something that I want to keep up into the future and would be very excited to discuss. \r\nLighter notes\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has all been rather serious so far! I have always enjoyed British comedy, e.g. Monty Python, The Office UK, Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb, Big Train, Not The Nine O Clock News, Bruiser, etc and would love to share some of these shows with people who are unfamiliar. I have very very fond memories of watching American comedies like Parks & Rec and The Good Place (a realllly cosy show) for the first time. I’m also a fan of animation like Smiling Friends, Futurama, Bob’s Burgers, and (especially) Bojack Horseman. You can also find my Letterboxd here. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m also into PC gaming, you can find my HowLongToBeat profile here - multiplayer gaming, no matter how casual, is definitely something I’d really enjoy doing with a partner. I’m very interested in the history of video games and computing, and am considering volunteering at a local computing museum.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy listening to 2000s/2010s pop, techno, emo and various shades of metal (especially metalcore and electronicore). I will be seeing Electric Callboy at Ally Pally in November. I want to go to more concerts and am willing to give anything a go provided the energy is good! \r\n\r\n\r\nI think it’s a great sign if we have compatible media preferences, but I don’t think it’s a requirement. The only thing I ask for is for an interest in things that I am interested in, and I will certainly return the interest! \r\nContact\r\nIf you’ve read this far, congratulations. Fire me an email on dmdgeorge24@gmail.com if you are interested or just want to chat. My main channel of communication is Discord, but I’m happy to use Whatsapp, Messenger, Signal etc."

      "fullText": "﻿(Last updated: 17 September 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Reading guide: Click/tap on yellow words like these[a] if you don't see a right sidebar. I'm using gdoc comments to annotate with footnotes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHello, and welcome to a time before Tinder and Match.com, where people got to know each other through a more in-depth process than one sentence, a bathroom selfie, and a pick-up line. Please allow me to introduce myself[b], and explain in excessive detail why you should date me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start, let’s get the boilerplate character sheet information out of the way. My name’s Richard Nicholson, I’m a Level 3 Human Programmer, male, age 32, straight and monogamous[c], wants kids (eventually). I live in Pacifica (tiny town just south of San Francisco) and I’m very used to hour-long drives[d] to get anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is my family knot, the Cær Niɣol!\r\n.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, who is this asshole anyways?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a creature of stories and games, but I mean both such concepts in frustratingly broad ways which become hard to express through sheer virtue of their vast scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nStories can mean obvious things like books, movies, anime, roleplaying games, and so forth, but it also means hearing about what happened to you at work today, or recounting that one time on vacation, listening to what you liked about a book (the story *of* the story is its own story), or the history of the evolution of ride ticketing models at Disneyland.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames means all the obvious things like videogames, boardgames, roleplaying games, sports, and such, but it also means things like using clever wording to layer meaning into sentences, mutilating the spirit of a rule while sticking to the letter, stepping between all the cracks on the sidewalk, or answering the question of WW1 tanks versus hippos[f] by doing research on how much force they can each exert and survive. I love exploring ideas and taking them apart; I love presenting my twisted results to others and seeing what they do with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a huge dabbler. At any given time I’m doing 3-5 “projects” (if you can count reading a book series as a project) with a dozen others on the back burner half or wholly forgotten. Not counting regularly scheduled events like watch parties, hobby club meetings, and roleplaying sessions. I try to pack a lot of fun and variety into my life. Accordingly, my hobbies are a pretty good lens through which to understand me. Here’s a smattering of my favorites:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Videogames (action, platforming, strategy, coop/team, logistics)\r\n* Rock climbing[g] (it’s like a workout, but a puzzle game!)\r\n* Books (fantasy/sci-fi, Lois McMaster Bujold, Brandon Sanderson, the Kingkiller Chronicles, and Phillip K. Dick especially)\r\n* Convoluted philosophically-inclined bullshit (Umineko, K6BD, Homestuck, Evangelion)\r\n* Sports (disc golf, minigolf, bowling, archery, curling, and wait there’s more!)\r\n* Sharing experiences and passing thoughts (I love the intimacy of seeing your interests and encounters in real time. I love to share things I find.)\r\n* Roleplaying games (various TTRPGs, e.g. D&D or Tenra Bansho Zero)\r\n* Cuddling (just being together is nice, but touching is special and important)\r\n* Board games (eurogame point salads, worker placement, action point limited, deckbuilder)\r\n* Animals! Let’s go to the zoo or go on a hike and look at birds![h]\r\n* Anime (Thunderbolt Fantasy, Violet Evergarden, FMA, Durarara)\r\n* Writing and game design (I make my own stories and games, too!)\r\n* kdrama (intrigue and mystery) (also does anyone know how to capitalize “K-Drama” and make it not look weird?)\r\n* Wordplay and linguistics (I WILL look up the etymology of that weird word, and use it for a godawful pun three weeks later. Or maybe three seconds later.)\r\n* SPREADSHEETS (there is nothing as exciting as well-formatted data! How do you rate this list?)\r\n* Music (Anything with a strong melody really. Strong lyrics to sing along to in the car, and high-energy stuff for workouts)\r\n* Nerdy documentaries on unnecessarily specific topics (like a 6-hour dissection[i] of a game about being a kid spending summer vacation in rural japan, and its thesis about childhood)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a lot more, especially in terms of dabblings I don’t actively pursue (genetics, crafting, proper walking technique, celtic knot drawing... etc.), but this list is long enough as it is. Time to nonsequitur!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sense of humor trends to postironic tastes, where something is both sarcastic (funny because it is false) and sardonic (funny because it is true) at the same time. The phrases that get reactions like “okay, that’s technically correct but...” or “that is absolutely not how that works! ...but maybe it has a point”, and especially “that’s stupid but correct/useful/great”. My true masterpieces are the ones where I say something which is deeply but subtly wrong, and you nod in casual acceptance until, “...wait a fucking second-!” Oh, I also enjoy silly and absurdist humor, too (like tone whiplash). You might have noticed that one already.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love the process of self-improvement. I used to think I wanted to be the very best that no one ever was, but then I took a closer look at the leaderboards. The games I am good at and most enjoy, I am consistently in the top 10% of the global rankings, except[j][k] when I am in the top 1%. I found it didn’t matter to me. I don’t want to be better than other people, I want to be better than me. I don’t care about being good, I care about being better. Improvement is itself the joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dating Philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nI've started trying to date without expectation[l]. Supposedly, as the ancient wisdom goes, if you live without expectation you are ready for anything. As the much less ancient but much more wise Mister Rogers said: “Love isn’t a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like 'struggle.' ” The most important parts of love aren't found, they are built. Intimacy, trust, safety, chemistry; these things don't form in a day, or even a month. These are the sorts of things that come from having been together through thick and thin, that are made of time and shared experience more than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has led me to value the friendship at the core of the romantic relationship. I don't want to overfocus on the future at the expense of the present. Those moments of connection in the present are what the future is built of and on. Worrying about what a lifetime together would look like makes no sense without first understanding what a week or month together looks like. I know in my mind that I should give that natural rhythm time to breathe and grow, to settle in to familiarity. Of course, emotionally I much prefer to take things objectively too fast and bathe in the crush phase 😂. It’s called “too” fast for a reason, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking for in a Partner\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, depending I guess on how you count, about four things I’m really looking for in my future life partner. They’re not immediately actionable issues, usually requiring gradual building of intimacy; they’re more like my areas of long term interest and focus. I’m sure these aren’t the only things I want, but these are my dealbreaker values. They are, from most to least important, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first is a mutual confidant. The kind of intimacy and trust that we can -- and more importantly, *do* -- share our secret thoughts with each other. Beyond being merely friends or close, I want our relationship to be a safe space. I want to represent safety and security to you, and I want to be able to find safety and security in you as well. I want you to be the dependable constant in my world that I can retreat to when life gets hard, and I yearn to provide that service as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second is friendship and companionship. Shared activities and aimless conversations. Someone who I can regale with whatever weird articles or dumb memes I stumbled across online that day, someone who tells me about the drama their coworkers keep starting. Watching shows or playing games together, or going out to the park or whatnot. I have some preferences on activity choice, but I’m not picky here; what matters to me is that we have fun things to do together and we enjoy ourselves doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third is a focus on lifestyle compatibility. This isn’t exactly something I’m looking for in a partner, so much as a value I am observing. A huge part of relationships is the things that aren’t fun, or the things so mundane as to escape notice. Doing chores, standards of cleanliness, what temperature is the bedroom, do we share a bed and/or bedroom or do we sleep separately, how are objects stored and organized around the house, and hundreds of other minutiae. This is a big deal and it’s the make-or-break (especially break) of many (if not all) partnerships. I’m not going to try to litigate that out here, -- it needs to be a conversation -- but it’s worth preparing this idea in our minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth and finally, kids. I don’t want kids right away, but I do want them some day. Probably one or two. I have a lot of natural inclinations both as a teacher and as a parent, and I want to channel them. Kids are great. Childrearing is another very complicated subject which, much like home lifestyle choices, tends to be assumed first and only considered once conflicts emerge. It’s definitely not a first date conversation, but it’s something that should be talked about before making a permanent commitment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this is in many ways a description of a relationship, not a partner. That’s somewhat unavoidable, as the two concepts are deeply intertwined and, well, definitionally inseparable. But you were probably hoping for some more person-scale descriptions to see if you match them, yeah? So here's that nice bullet point list of melodramatically pretentious trait descriptions you ordered:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Integrity. Both in terms of personal responsibility, and a pride in precision. Someone specific and direct when speaking who cuts off misunderstandings and ambiguities[m] before they happen.\r\n* Playfulness. This one is mostly literal and also one of the most important. It’s important to have fun, even when doing something serious. The desire to toy with things is one of the traits I find most attractive and full of depth for connection. A mischievous streak is a bonus. 😉\r\n* Conversation. I love to talk, at length. Sharing stories, investigating some random factoid, snide banter, and otherwise just experiencing the mind of another. This is a very important level of connection for me, and I find the ability to speak openly and honestly very precious.\r\n* Honesty. Not in terms of not telling lies, but as a commitment to tell the truth. To be the one who speaks up when something is wrong, even when it is uncomfortable.\r\n* Curiosity. I like people who try to learn and understand the world around them. To push past surface level comprehension and hunt for the details.\r\n* Understanding and Growth. There are a lot of things people don’t know or are bad at. Not in terms of some mystical conspiracy, but just generally people aren’t perfect. It’s important to forgive people for being imperfect, and to show some grace. This is even more important in a relationship: There will be misunderstandings, there will be conflicts. In order to make anything lasting, both of us will need the maturity to talk about what is wrong and the flexibility to learn and change.\r\n* Self. I want a partner with an inner fire. I want someone with the audacity to be herself and to shape the world to suit her needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle; or, What I’m looking for in a relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about lifestyle compatilibity[n].\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the oddities of the distinction between a friend and a roommate (and by extension, a spouse) is that the hierarchy of which traits are important is largely inverted. Small lifestyle patterns are not very important in a friendship, or even a sexual relationship, but are some of the most important things for a roommate or spouse. Does your friend do the dishes before the meal, after the meal, or procrastinate them? You don’t really care! But if you wake up every day to find your roommate’s dishes in YOUR sink, well now that might be an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating has taught me that there are so many variations in lifestyle that I cannot possibly imagine. You will have expectations of me I cannot possibly predict, and vice versa, about topics we don't even think have choices – even while things are going wrong! For example: going out to eat. When you order food on a date, who is it for? I’ve seen the unspoken and assumed “obvious” expectation be that one eats the food they ordered, that my partner will order less for themself and steal my food, that we order together and trade food, and also that my partner will order far too much and expect me to eat half of it. I’m very comfortable with the first option and somewhat comfortable with the third, and can tolerate the second, but the fourth? I was certain nobody does that, even after experiencing it for three months.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I was recently given the feedback “I didn’t think you were into me; we had a very long first date and you never tried to hold my hand” and at the time my reaction was, “Hold hands? On a first date? What kind of a SLUT do you think I am? How am I supposed to show that I’m interested in you as a person and not a sex object if we’re getting touchy so fast? I don’t want to be that guy!” Which to be clear, I understand now that this is insanity and holding hands on a first date is not a scandal. The point is that it is a key example in highlighting how impossible and unthinkable the perspectives and assumptions of others can be, and also how simple it can be to bridge the gap if you simply ask about it with your words.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m sure there are an infinite number of such unthinkable (to me) lifestyles that people really expect of their partner, which is the axis of relationship communication that is most often neglected. It’s important to talk about these sorts of ignorable issues early and build a consensus on how to act. If one is serious about a lifelong partnership, than much like committing to sitting still in a chair for the next 18 hours, you really want it to start out as comfortable as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, my lifestyle has existed in so many different forms, each unrecognizable to the others (yours probably has too); I’m a person and I change. My love of learning and growth and constant self-improvement can lead me to rather drastic and sometimes sudden changes to large portions of my life: I once went from watching 6+ hours of youtube daily to none, because I felt it was becoming a burden. I once went from only doing things online to attending distant events four days a week, and then a few months later dropped all of those events and started a new workout routine. There’s also a time when I had the same meal for breakfast for five years straight. It’s hard to guess what has longevity and will remain interesting or sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human mind is capable of astonishing levels of self-modification; if you can show me a different way to live, I can incorporate (at least parts of) that into my own lifestyle, and I’ll probably want to. Maybe being with a wonderful person will remove some of my hangups: Perhaps I won’t find certain things so difficult, or I’ll find a hidden joy in something I had dismissed. Or perhaps you’ll introduce me to something entirely new, and I’ll make space to rebuild my life around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, what would living with me look like? What do I want out of that?\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’ve lived my whole life in the Bay Area. I don’t particularly comprehend the alternative[o], but there are places like Portland and Seattle where I might not notice the difference. I'm not tied to the specific location and I'm at a place in my life that I could move anywhere, but I'm not sure what living elsewhere would be like or if I'd enjoy it.\r\n* Despite the plethora of things I like to do at home, I grew up outside. I don’t just mean the near-daily trips to the zoo, but my grandfather[p] would take me on hikes every week to go birdwatching. I’ve been backpacking with the boy scouts and such, and I never want to give up proximity to nature... but also I’ve become okay with “wimp camping” full of modern conveniences, or not camping at all anymore. 😅\r\n   * I am the kind of person who could comfortably not leave their house for several consecutive months[q], and also the kind of person who can go on a ten mile hike by accident. That’s not hyperbole, I’ve done that dozens of times.\r\n* I love doing things together, even when I couldn’t manage them alone. Going to the movies by yourself just feels wrong, you know? There’s a bunch of things I like doing with others that I can’t bring myself to do by myself. Minigolf, bowling, movies, hikes... I’m sure there’s also plenty of things I’ve never thought of that I’d love getting dragged along to.\r\n   * I value time spent together very highly, but we can’t spend all our time together. Not just from a practical standpoint (e.g. employment) but there’s no activity so good you never need a break from it. I don’t know what that balance will look like; I’m sure it will vary based on which interests we align on.\r\n* The kitchen will be clean! To a like, 80% degree! Dishes can briefly soak in the sink in extreme cases, but they best be moving to the dishwasher within a day. Pots and pans do not sit dirty after a meal. If anything, I will clean them before I eat. Other parts of the house are whatever, but the kitchen is a place of industry and therefore it needs to retain baseline operational capacity. For the rest of the house, I’d much rather stay clean by not making a mess in the first place, and neat and organized can look nice, but as long as things don’t get cluttered I accept that any space that people actually live in will succumb to some level of chaos[r].\r\n* I love trips to faraway places, but I’m perfectly content with 0 to 2 such trips per year. I hate the process of traveling, the anxiety of making sure I’ve packed everything, and getting through an airport without anything weird happening (track record is startlingly bad). I love being there on the other side though!\r\n   * There’s still a lot of places I’d love to visit someday. The waterfalls of Iceland, another trip to South Korea or Japan, Australian wildlife centers, Germany, maybe another stay in Patagonia or New Zealand just because they’re pretty...\r\n   * Also, maybe having a partner with me will ease my hangups? If you turn out to be better at managing the parts I struggle with, perhaps I can enjoy the rest of it without reservation and will join you on monthly vacations. Who knows!\r\n* I am not a pet person. I am especially not a rambunctious puppy person[s]. I love animals, but I find living with them exhausting. If I am going to put in that much work, I want things in return that they can’t give. Old dogs and certain cats are alright because they’re calmer and relatively self-sufficient, and terrarium pets are great because I can ignore them and they don’t mind. But if I’m gonna have a small energetic disaster living in my home, I would hope it is a human child. Those at least learn to talk.\r\n* Cozy time is important. Talking about each other’s day, what we’ve seen and read and done recently, plans for the immediate term future, and assorted random nonsense. Time to cuddle and simply be together. I value this one a lot, it’s probably the second most intimate thing I can imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I’d like to know about you\r\n~~ AKA ways to introduce yourself to me when you’ve run out of ideas ~~\r\n\r\n\r\n* What’s your trashy comfort fic? Do you read litRPGs, HP fanfic, edgy vampire teens? Romance novels or shoujyo manga, chuuni shounen, Deep Lore stuff? Also, B-movie horror or kung fu flicks qualify. What’s your fiction vice?\r\n* What did you do this week that you don’t normally do? Nobody ever has a truly “normal” week where everything colors inside the lines of their regular schedule. So: Did you make progress on a project, or go on an adventure - maybe by accident?  What stood out to you, what did you find interesting about this week?\r\n* What’s a super cool place or event you’ve been to? It doesn’t necessarily have to be travel. A really neat museum, a friend’s unforgettable wedding, that one playground you wish you were small enough to go back to, or any sort of chaos so far out of the ordinary it defies categorization. What is a memory you cherish?\r\n* If you were suddenly freed of all obligations – and I mean all: no need to eat or sleep, no need for money, etc – what would you do with your time? When you finally have no pressure on you, what do you actually enjoy pursuing?\r\n* Any thoughts you have on dating. As a process, as a commodity in the dating app world (and why you turned to dateme docs[t]), how it does or should function, the dysfunctions to avoid, past experiences that guide your present, or your current philosophy. I'm especially interested in things you dislike about dating and how you would change it, as I would love to incorporate those lessons. It’s always a fascinating topic to hear how different everyone’s perspectives and experiences are in this field!\r\n\r\n\r\nCall me, maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this far! If you didn’t actually read this far and just skimmed to the bottom, thanks anyways for still being interested. If you want to date me, think we would be a good match, or just want to chat and go on some outings, send me a mail at elathrain@gmail.com. Tell me a little about why, and something about yourself!\r\n[a]Congratulations! If you can read this, you now have access to the proper reading experience.\r\n[b]🎵 I'm a man of wealth, and taste 🎵\r\n[c]I remain open to discussing various degrees of open relationship and/or my partner being poly so long as I’m their primary partner, although personally I am monogamous (or at least monogamish) by nature. (Besides, finding a first partner is hard enough! 😂)\r\n[d]This seems to always horrify people that I drive this far. No really, it's fine.\r\n[e]For those of the discerning eye: Why yes, I did in fact change the font to Times New Roman just for that name. The kerning on the lowercase gamma is *unforgivably _awful_* in Arial.\r\n[f]My friends started asking some \"who would win in a fight\" questions that got really out of hand.\r\n[g]I stick to indoor bouldering gyms. I like knowing there are mats if I fall even if I rarely need them. It lets me go all-out and push my limits safely.\r\n[h]Weird how this point isn’t formatted the same huh? That’s gonna bug someone... Oh wait it’s me.\r\n[i]For the curious: Action Button Reviews Boku no Natsuyasumi\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=779coR-XPTw\r\n[j]wait a fucking second-!\r\n[k]😉\r\n[l]This is harder than it sounds, and has proven more difficult than anticipated. Which might be my problem right there, that I had expectations for not having expectations 😏\r\n[m]Except of course when messing around and ambiguity is the joke. Ambiguity is a great joke.\r\n[n]The term is described far more fully in this blog article, which provides additional good foundational understanding of a relationship.\r\nhttps://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner-part-2.html\r\n[o]Sure I’ve stayed briefly in the mountains and such, but that doesn't provide me an understanding of what living in the country would actually be like. It's like suggesting I move to Lothlórien; it doesn't make sense to me.\r\n[p]After he retired he became the head of the bay area chapter of the Auduban Society! Dude is a walking library of birds. Ask him about a call and he can give you the bird's full name and description from the sound alone.\r\n[q]It was after surgery in the summer of 2020, so not leaving my room was a responsible choice, not (just) a lazy one.\r\n[r]Even Marie Kondo conceded this point after her third child. Life creates chaos, and sometimes that chaos is better to manage than eliminate.\r\n[s]I learned this by currently living in a house with a rambunctious puppy. Send help.\r\n[t]Good choice, by the way!"

This is K speaking.\n(I'll tell you my name later, of course. Even my shoe size. Just not sure how this 'going public with loads of seriously personal' works yet...)\nI'd like to start with some controversies, if I may - they should tickle your interest buds, all being well.\nAnd there you go, the first one has just\nlanded\n, and even without intent!\nI make up phrases in English sometimes, quite probably because it is my second language. But aren't your interest buds all the merrier now that they know they exist?!\nFor illustration\n(\nthough, a non-linguistic one\n):\nphotographic evidence of the moment when my nephew and I invented the 'simultaneous reverse swing selfie' 10 years ago.\n(I've made the whole sorcery into a 12\" video but this site wouldn't... so this is the end frame, as you can tell from the catharsis on our faces.)\nalrighty then, on with the controversies...\nI love hiking\nbut hate camping\nthese two loonies\nI wasn't supposed to befriend because\nI am allergic to dogs\nbut I've walked them for a friend with the greatest joy dozens of times\nbest sound and smell!\naaand I am allergic to dust 😩\nI'm creative (in some ways)\nand while you might not get the sense instantly, I'll have you know that I've just done an online test and it says it is one of my signature strengths, OK?!\ntime to get back to the allergies...\nI love dogs, horses and cats are OK, too, but if you have any of these living in your house, we'd be in a pickle...\nBut hey, don't write me down as 'the allergy girl'! I might be lactose intolerant and vegetarian, too, but no hayfever can sweep me off my feet!\nJokes aside (hope you've been having the time of your life so far), I'm a heterosexual female, 178 cm tall and 60 kg, give or take, and an atheist. I turned 40 three months ago, which feels so recent, but if you think about it, that's one Q already... 😶\nI live in London normally (but presently unemployed so sticking it out in a cheaper place) but if a job offer took me to Copenhagen, Stockholm or Amsterdam by any chance, I wouldn't weep my eyes out. (I love bikes and definitely prefer cycling to public transport... but not just for the bike culture, of course!)\nI work in project management in the creative industries but I've just completed a short course in environmental sustainability and oh my, there's just so much potential in so many areas of sustainable development! I firmly believe that if anything, technology and science will save humanity from exterminating this planet but there's so much everyone can do! I hope you agree with that and don't let climate despair get the better of you!\nI hate waste in any of its forms (materials, time, money, energy....). I wish I had the skills of a chemical engineer to invent more ways to upcycle/recycle waste. Or the powers of a social psychologist to ignite a grassroots movement that would turn overconsumption into something society would end up frowning upon and would eventually lead to global behavioural change... (My folks call me naive at least once a fortnight so it's OK if you think I'm a bit too far into wishful thinking, don't worry.)\nLacking the skills of scientists, though, at least I have a skeleton idea of a dark comedy tv show (in terms of flavour, think of a layered cake of Boat Story, Back to Life, After Life, and, me, of course) that would stick it into the faces of local governments (and the main one) re how much more they could actually do (or try to do) to solve/ease a bunch of social and environmental issues at local levels. We'd be following the stumblings of a 40-something main character who is completely lost on the tracks of self-development (but sane, just kind of driftwood-ish a bit), and circumstances make him/her settle into a small town community, and we watch in awe how these stumblings sometimes turn into brilliant solutions to problems without the main character's slightest awareness of his/her role in them... anyway, I could go on but you'd need to sign an NDA. However, if you have any ties to Two Brothers Pictures or Harry Williams or Jack Williams (the two brothers) or their EAs or their PAs or their postman, get in touch this instant, of course! (Ricky Gervais' management agency I had tried already, the most junior of their junior staff bounced me off in a blink of an eye, albeit, politely 🙂 )\nBut yeah, if not changing the perception of the population about overconsumption and overproduction, there are still a billion things to try, right?! I did some decluttering a couple of months ago, took crates of items to a market with the intent of donating the proceeds to animal shelters. Luckily, I managed to sell a dozen items or so. Then winter came, the books got soaked right after unpacking one time so I took the whole thing online. I created a website, photographed hundreds of clothes, books, utensils, knick-knacks, and spent ages uploading and describing everything and getting word out on local social media... then 3 books and a cheesegrater got bought. But hey, the intent was there!\nDreaming of having a small abode right by a lake\nThis spot is my favourite so far but I'm happy to go for an old Scandinavian villa on sale for peanuts with you, to do up while I can swim a lot and make lots of hot beverages for us. Or a Mediterranean little house? With colder drinks?\nAre you also scanning social media channels like cheappropertyeurope and such daily? (Ours will have solar panels and a heat pump and all the clever things, OK?)\nI asked a friend to describe me as this seems to be a frequent advice re dating profiles... so this is from her (and I am all blushing while typing):\nA clever introvert with such integrity but little confidence.\nShe values tranquility over fanfare but she is all in for adventures and creating memorable experiences.\nKeeps lots of her ideas to herself despite being a creative person, possibly due to being afraid (that lack of confidence thing...).\nIntelligent, great sense of humour, quick on the uptake but a bit sceptical first about new things. Sometimes it takes a bit of letting guards down but after that she is a truly loyal, trustworthy friend, by your side through thick and thin.\nShe is monogamous and would go for problem-solving without hesitation rather than throwing it all in way too soon. She expects honesty and loyalty in return as well: once trust is gone, it would be a rocky road winning it back.\nThe person who will fall for her (who will seriously want to make her happy) will get a most devoted wingman (woman), that's for sure. And the two of them will carry around laughing their heads off, probably. She is such fun when there's no need for walls.\nThere. Can you believe all that praise?!\nEmbarrassingly\nlovely, isn't she? But she has known me since I was about 3 years old so... 😬\nAnd you know me a little by now, too, don\"t you? - let's get pragmatic and avoid wasting each other's time (if that's the case) because wasting is so insanely stupid.\nI guess this aversion to waste accounts for my thriftiness and indecisiveness. For me it takes longer to decide on a purchase or an action plan than for most people - and if you are the kind of clever guy I'm after, it might have already clicked for you that what I'm trying to do with the best intentions is just another form of wasting, i.e. wasting time under the illusion that I'm working out the optimal usage of resources.... 🙃  how dumb, huh?! If you'd found me out, get in touch by all means. I could definitely welcome someone in my life who catches me out when I should be. And the best would be if you were patient and easy-going, too. Or just patient.\nI don't seem to be attracted to men with long hair and I am not keen on facial hair, either (I have a theory that circa 98.7% of men sporting a beard or a moustache would look incomparably more handsome without them. There's such a tiny segment of the male population who might actually benefit from growing facial hair that I could almost elevate this theory into a general rule. But I won't, cause I respect the rights of those 1,214 men to attractiveness.).\nI prefer not being taller, stronger, faster, fitter or heavier than my man.\nI'm not planning on having kids so it would be great if you didn't have/want any, either.\nI guess I am just writing this whole novella because I wonder if there's a chance after you have already lived half of your life to find someone who can add kindness and smiles to the remaining years while you want to add the same to theirs because you both understand how precious companionship actually is. Just looking for a team mate (whom I quite fancy), I reckon.\nYou don't need to be a dashing prince with wealth or have a great sense of style but as long as your sense of humour is ace and you like to fool around while also being aware that no relationship can get far without respect or honesty and that maintenance on it will most probably be needed along the way, too, we could be in for something.\nBe old enough to know that you carry the responsibility for all you do and say but young enough to still want to venture out there and enjoy tomfoolery. (38-46 would cover that, you think?)\nbirthday present\nloved it! (I mean, I didn't get the plane...)\ngood to become friends\nwith strangers who bring your food\ndidn't get this aircraft, either\nbut maaan, holding out your phone on a trike for a photo when there's absolutely nothing underneath is a thrill!\na full body shot\nis probably also expected...

I am looking for my fellow beautiful nerd!\r\nName & pronouns: Tanner, he/him\r\nAge: 40 Height: 5'9\" / 175cm\r\nLiving Location: Groningen, Netherlands; American born and raised in the United States\r\nStudies: BSc in Psychology, MSc in Environmental Psychology\r\nOrientation: Straight, looking for a woman aka spirit-animal level\r\nRelationship type: Monogamous/ish (I’d like to establish an outstanding relationship with a partner prior to adding the complexity of a third party), I would like to raise kids with a partner and starting this process at the same time going on that particular adventure together, looking for the right partner to do life with.  \r\n\r\n    \r\nMy life as a film logline: A romantic adventure about a guy (40) who worked in IT, tv/film, and finally finished 4 intense years of university (psychology), now seeking to find a forever partner in this beautiful wide world.\r\nHobbies: learning the mandolin, learning Dutch, lindy hop swing dancing, independent films, long-distance cycling trips, hiking, skiing, writing, personal development, scuba diving, community organizing, improv, reading, writing.\r\nMy personality traits using HEXACO, which has the most validity and reliability of such psychological assessments, is Openness 96%, Conscientious 98%, Extraversion 96%, Agreeableness 95%, Emotional Stability 97%, Honesty-Humility 96%; all of these percentiles are plotted relative to a normal distribution.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends/Colleagues/People I Know\r\nHello beautiful people whom I already have the pleasure of knowing. If you are worried about “ruining the friendship,” I can promise with very high confidence that won’t happen. If you’re worried about looking foolish if you try and we do not click, I can also promise that I’ll always have nothing but respect for people who show vulnerability to reveal who they really are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\nI was born in a small town near the border of Utah but located in Colorado (US citizen, US passport). Losing myself in nature came natural to me as a child, exploring the thin air at the tops of mountains, the lush forest, and the arid badlands; losing myself in nature continues to be a lifelong love of mine. It took me some time to rediscover my bliss compass and how to use it, but once I learned (including via cognitive behavior therapy i.e., talk therapy), it opened me up. It took me on my own hero’s journey where I left the world of IT and my self-imposed invisible retaining wall, and opened myself up to vulnerability and intimacy with others. I explored storytelling and storymaking, working in Los Angeles in tv and film. I served, near the Aegean Sea, the needs of people fleeing war and hardship in refugee camps. Then I relocated to the Netherlands and returned to university dedicated to becoming a psychologist so that I could use that knowledge to help people in relation to our greatest societal challenges, earning a BSc in Psychology and MSc in Environmental Psychology. Along all these journeys I learned to be open, to try everything, to say yes, to embrace uncertainty (most of the time), and to be intimately attentive and responsive to my intuition.\r\nIn each stage of my journey, it became increasingly important that I understand the problems and sufferings of people and more-than-humans so that I can do what I excel at…bring very different people together and co-develop and bring about solutions to these consequential problems. I once heard a quote that “one must save themselves before they can save the world.”\r\nI’ve always been a late bloomer (or felt like I was a late bloomer). Late to learn to tie my shoes; try alcohol; achieve the death of my ego; have the feeling of falling in love; going on the university journey, embracing the beauty of my own body; deciding I want a forever partner (note: I’ve never been married); deciding I want to raise a family (note: I have no children). And as a luminous late bloomer, I am using this time to find my beautiful other.\r\nI have a great amount of genuine curiosity about the world and about people. As such, I discover many incredible beautiful souls and I like nothing more than bringing all of these extraordinary humans together so they can also fall in love with each other. I am a natural bringer-together of people. Example, the JamesWebbSpaceTelescope group where we have dinner parties and discuss the beauties and properties of the universe while reviewing the latest awe-inspiring imagery coming from the telescope (of the cosmos), with attending explanations of the image content. Recently I kicked off a book club focused on The Artist Way (by Julia Cameron) where we share our thoughts, feelings, challenges, and difficulties together as we complete the workbook.\r\nI am an empath, loving, affectionate, careful, and honest. I love to dance and most recently am taking lindy hop lessons. So long as I can be verbally and artistically expressive, I am full of glee, kicking off the covers in the morning and dancing my way through life :) I am a deep listener, present, communicative, and I’m told I give extraordinarily good hugs. I adore deep conversations and love the unfolding of all manner of topics, experiences, and reflections in creative-flow conversation.\r\nIt is important that I live congruently with my values; I’m going full vegan this year (2024) as it is important to me I do not cause harm to other creatures and that I live within the planetary boundaries. I now know too much about the reality of this moment so I am prompted to action. While I am a scientist I am also an artist and am spiritual. I am spiritual in the sense of feeling and reflecting on the fact that I am but one output of the universe, made of atoms that have their own lineage of existence; I explore, ponder, and rejoice regarding my own connection with the cosmos. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I Sing the Song of the Universe\r\nI am involved with practical transformations of society to achieve an existence of humanity within the planetary boundaries (e.g., depart from neoliberal economics for thrivenomics?), equality, and justice for all, while also caretaking for the more-than-human creatures. In my profession and as a hobby, I build communities. Professionally, I co-run a non-profit non-extractive consultancy that conducts research, drafts scientific-literature-based interventions, and performs project management of transition projects, all regenerative, to achieve societies that thrive within the planetary boundaries. As mentioned earlier, I used to work in IT where I would bring all the stakeholders and team members together to achieve alignment in succeeding or failing at achieving our goal as a team. With my shiny new MSc in Environmental Psychology, I do something similar but in relation to helping to move our societies into the safe/thriving zone regarding social services and planetary resources i.e., the safe and just space of the Doughnut Economics model.\r\nI also volunteer for causes that I see as virtuous, currently with Extinction Rebellion, Scientist Rebellion, Scientist4Future, and community organizer for local regenerative non-extractive food growing/consumption. Before that I volunteered with a community theater, political organizing, Make a Wish foundation, and refugee camp aid volunteer/emergency responder.\r\nMy core values are:\r\n* generosity\r\n* honesty/transparency\r\n* empathy\r\n* joy/bliss\r\n* deep listening/presence\r\n* interdependence \r\n* being in the moment\r\n* Playfulness\r\nHere are some visuals that are ever constant in my world:    \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traits I am looking for in a partner:\r\nI would love to find a special someone who is:\r\n1. Kind to others, compassionate, empathetic, interdependent approach, authentic, curious, interested and motivated – someone who ranks high on emotional intelligence and goes out of there way for meaningful exchange; let’s their curiosity lead them to investigate/research, pursues interests, is proactive bliss motivated rather than fear pushed.\r\n2. Warm, joyful, silly, playful - someone who radiates warmth, love, and joy; who has a playful sense of humor and doesn't take themselves too seriously; who finds joy in connection and in making others feel good about themselves.\r\n3. Impact driven – take notice of societal issues and takes action to bend the needle of the moment  in the direction of the good and just; a person who acts congruent with their well-defined values; who does meaningful work congruent with those values, and that they feel good about their efforts (either professionally or as a volunteer or donor or as a side project).\r\nI am quite active, flowing through life and trying out all the entrees. In sport (fencing, snowboarding, marathons, etc.), in art (improv, dancing, mandolin-learning, etc.), and I guess I’d call it “exploring” (volunteering, long cycling trips, hiking, top rope climbing, scuba diving, etc.). Additionally, I spend a great share of my time with loved ones (friends, family, and I hope soon a partner); with romantic relationships I am quite physically affectionate (as a psychologist, I thought I’d mention that my attachment style is secure attachment). I think I would be well matched with another who correlates with a good deal of the above. I am looking for one also marriage-minded/forever partner and I am also keen to raise a family.\r\nI’d love to create a partnership that is rooted in mutual consideration and support, is embedded in community regeneration, and is full of emotional and physical affection. \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to connect? \r\nI’d love to hear from you! Email me at datingtanner@proton.me. You definitely don't need to have your own date me doc, but it would probably be helpful to include a bit about     yourself, some photos, and what made you want to reach out! *The cat below isn’t mine ;)\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus\r\nWow, you are thorough!

After some difficult times around the pandemic I decided to give my future prospects a boost by getting back into education. Currently I’m a freelance tutor. I teach guitar and English (eg GCSE, primary), and I hope to advance this through taking a degree in English. I’ve always written a lot, and studying at Kings’ College London under published academics, poets and novelists I hope to increase my chances of getting some additional work as a freelance writer, perhaps in journalism or educational texts. I write fiction and poetry too. I’m quite ambitious, and I like the idea of getting into something more scholarly, perhaps even lecturing. I’ve spent much of my life as a musician, but this is something I’m less interested in now, other than the professional tutoring I do.\nInterests and personality\nI enjoy reading. Some favourite books include\nThe Left Hand of Darkness\nby Ursula K le Guin,\nCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin\nby Louis de Bernieres,\nKafka on the Shore\nby Murakami,\nDavid Copperfield\nby Dickens,\nBrave New World\nby Aldous Huxley,\nFlowers for Algernon\nby Daniel Keyes,\nThe Buddha of Suburbia\nby Hanif Kureishi,\nOryx and Crake\nby Margaret Atwood, and\nThe Mayor of Casterbridge\nby Thomas Hardy.\nI also read history - favourite periods/subjects so far include Soviet Russia, nineteenth century Europe, the French Revolution and World War II.\nThat’s all pretty heavy isn’t it…\nSo, in lighter news: I like having a laugh (despite having read books about the Soviet Union), and people say I’m funny (although you can be the judge of that). They’d probably also say I’m a sensitive soul (may as well confess this now), and it’s quite important to me to have long, deeper conversations with people. I could easily chat till 6am to people I click with. I don’t demand this of any prospective partner (!) but I don’t think it would work if our conversations lacked depth. Another thing people say of me is that I put people at ease.\nA few more things I enjoy\nMusic: I like classical these days, a few fav composers include Beethoven, Chopin and Ravel. I also like arty rock, soul, jazz and ambient; a few artists I listen to/have listened to: Bowie, The Velvet Underground, Radiohead, Sonic Youth, The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Leonard Cohen, Antony and the Johnsons.\nWalking.\nFilms and drama: I like arthouse, sci-fi, comedy and more.\nTheatre (just getting into it).\nGeneral evenings out (although to be fair staying in with good company seems more and more appealing these days).\nWhat do I want from a relationship?\nCompanionship, fun, comfort, being challenged sometimes, sharing experiences. I love children, so I would like to have kids. I tend to be attracted to big personalities, or at least people who have their own deeper interests, whether that be professional or otherwise. I respect sincerity, but I don’t expect people to tell me everything about them from day one.\nDrop me an email if this is your thing (see above for my address)."

Until recently, I’ve always lived in co-ops and group houses (5+ people), and really love most things about group living. I recently moved to my own place, but still value this sort of community and try to stay involved with group houses where I’ve lived in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really like being active outdoors. In the past that’s involved a lot of cycling, especially mountain biking. These days I still bike almost everywhere I go, but tennis is my go-to physical activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m vegetarian and reduce my consumption of animal products where convenient.\r\nWork\r\nCurrently, I work at an AI company because it seems like helping AI go well (or rather, helping it not go poorly) is potentially very impactful. I care a lot about my work because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I got here: I studied physics because it was interesting and I value humans understanding the world. In grad school I found out that doing good was so neglected that you could save a life for a few $k. I took a job with a highish ability to donate while figuring out what to do next. GPT-3/scaling-laws happened next, and I decided that’s what I could be most useful doing.\r\nYou\r\nI’m a rather rational, analytical person and I think I’d like to find someone who is as well, but also someone who’s kind and cares about the welfare of others.\r\nUs\r\nIn previous long-term relationships (most recently 6yr), I’ve really enjoyed having someone to cook a quick meal with after work, then get outside with for a tennis match or bike ride, and finally cuddle up to half a movie, back rubs, or just reading and chatting. I’m pretty affectionate, and physical contact and emotional warmth are important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually it’d be amazing to face life as a team, optimizing jointly for what’s best for both of us. We’d support each-other’s growth where wanted and work together towards being the people each of us wants to be and living the lives each of us wants to live.\r\nKids\r\nShort version: no kids\r\n\r\nLong Version: I don’t want kids any time soon, and I’m much more comfortable committing to not having kids than to having them. The rest of this decade is potentially a particularly important and crazy time for the world, and I’m not totally sure what my life or the world will look like afterwards. Depending on what the world looks like in ~2030 I’m potentially open to kids then.\r\n(Non)-Monogamy\r\nI’ve been in various mono/open relationships in the past and am open to most relationship types as long as there’s clear and open communication about it. The important thing to me is finding the right person.\r\nContact\r\nI’m <wampiter at gmail dot com> and facebook.com/wampiter"

SF Bay Area; not looking for a long-distance relationship. Software engineer. No kids, but I'll probably want kids someday. 6'1\" tall. Atheist. Politically liberal (but with a lot of nuance). Drink socially, no tobacco or drugs.\nPhotos\nAbout me\nI'm a thinker and a tinkerer: As a kid, I was addicted to LEGOs, but my meager allowance couldn't support my LEGO habit, so in my teens I switched to coding. In undergrad, I detoured into physics at Caltech; although I was an 'A' student, I decided research wasn't my passion, so I didn't pursue a PhD. I'm now an engineer at AI research lab Anthropic. (And I love my job!) I also dabble in electronics and 3D printing, leaving behind a trail of\nhalf-finished projects, as well as some finished ones\n.\nI love spending time with my friends, even if it's just casually chatting over dinner or hanging out on a friend's couch. I'm semi-introverted -- I get along fine with new people, but my \"social battery\" gets depleted after a few hours.\nA sample of things I enjoy:\nBret Devereaux's history blog\n,\nMatt Levine on finance\n,\nChemical Safety Board investigations\n,\nr/PixelArt\n,\nr/WholesomeMemes\n,\nr/Frogs\n(they're cute! 🐸). I'm more the \"academic\" kind of nerd than the \"Star Trek and D&D\" kind of nerd, but I get along well with the latter kind. I play video games occasionally, and when I'm having a bad day, my guilty pleasure is to binge-read terrible manga.\nI enjoy being out in nature, and I ride my bike along the Bay Trail on weekends. I like road trips, and my friends and I usually go on a road trip every winter. I kinda want to travel abroad more, but I'm not a fan of long plane flights.\nAlthough I'm financially stable, my ethos tends towards minimalism. I prefer not to own unnecessary things. I like mending worn clothes and fixing broken things. My apartment is tiny, clean, and cozy. I currently live alone, but I've had roommates in the past and really enjoyed it. Living with people is a great way to form a healthy and supportive community!\nWhat I'm looking for\nRelationships should be comfortable and fun! I want a relationship where I can be myself and my partner can be herself. Good communication and mutual emotional support are important.\nI love to cuddle. Physical touch is my love language.\nIn-depth conversations are my other love language. What exactly is a leap-second? Is a certain fractal space-filling?

      "fullText": "﻿Date Me | Puja Gandhi (last updated 12/2023)\r\n\r\n\r\nHi There!\r\n \r\nI’m looking for a life partner, and decided to make this longer-style profile as a means to better articulate who I am, what I’m looking for, and maybe I find my human along the way 🤞\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Fairly traditional, 37 y/o female (5’ 2”) looking for someone who is kind, family-oriented, prioritizes being outdoors/being active, who strives for balance in life while also being somewhat ambitious. I was born and raised in the US and am a US citizen. \r\n\r\nYou can find more photos of me and my highlight reel on my instagram (I’m an infrequent user)\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a Texas Native currently ‘living’ in Seattle, Wa. I say ‘living’ because my mailing address and company I work for is based in Seattle, but I also live/work remotely from other locations. I’m a bit of a minimalist in the sense that I live out of a carry-on and checked bag for the most part and keep my other things (think ski gear/tents/sleeping bag/etc) in storage. I have been living in short term rentals post-pandemic and I like the flexibility and cost-savings this lifestyle provides (for now, not forever). \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for education/career; I have a Master’s degree in Analytical Chemistry (proud PhD dropout), and I no longer do anything chemistry related – I now work as a product/program manager for a remittance payments company. The work is meaningful to me and pays me enough to live a comfortable lifestyle that is flexible without an excessive amount of stress. I suppose you could say I ‘designed’ my career path to be this way (you can see about the unconventional path I took on my linkedin). I’d eventually love to have children, and I’d like to be a present/active mother, so I chose this career path to allow me more time to care for those close to me whom I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I have so. many. hobbies. In the winters, I teach skiing at a local ski resort outside of Seattle. I don’t mean the ‘cool’ downhill skiing, but I’m talking about dorky Nordic, cross-country skiing. I love being outside, in nature, in the snow with friends and sharing my love of the outdoors with children. I also volunteer with Outdoors for all and teach skiing through that program as well. In the fairer seasons, you’ll find me backpacking, hiking, and cycling. Prior to the pandemic, I purchased a Specialized Ruby Road bike, and have logged over 10K miles on it since then. I love road cycling, but would also love to dive into trying out a gravel-style bike as well!\r\n\r\n\r\nI love being outdoors, but I can also chill. When I’m having a weekend indoors, you’ll find me curled up with a cup of tea knitting sweaters, or taking on a design/woodworking project. One of my dreams is to have a woodworking shop, and to build a sauna in my backyard! \r\nSimple times spent cooking with friends/family, sharing new experiences with others, or enjoying a sunrise/sunset with others are what make me happiest. I have a website that I last updated in 2022 that can tell you a bit more if you’re curious. \r\n\r\n\r\nWho you are:\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is excited about finding a monogamous long term relationship leading to marriage/kids. You are family-oriented. \r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who loves the outdoors and travel\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are intentional, sincere, and ready for a long term relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAre open to living in a place where being surrounded by nature and outdoor activity is accessible and part of daily life\r\n\r\n\r\nYou love to challenge yourself and try new things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m a vegetarian and have a strong preference for folks who are plant-based. If you are a carnivore or eat meat daily, this won’t work. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’d really like to have biological children of my own with someone who wishes to be a present parent.  If having children isn’t your jam, this isn’t going to be a fit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill intrigued/think this is a fit?\r\n\r\n\r\nSend me a message at gandhi.pj@gmail.com, I’d love to connect!"

      "fullText": "﻿Hi there! I’m Tejas. I’m not very familiar with “date-me” docs, and haven’t read too many of them, but I thought I’d write a brief one. I only recently decided to start looking for a relationship, and thought this was a reasonable place to start!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’d be potentially interested at all, please feel free to shoot me an email (you can reach me at tejassubramaniam@gmail.com) or contact me via Facebook Messenger. Feel free to tell me a bit about yourself, but even just expressing possible interest works!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I’m 22, and currently an undergraduate student at Stanford (studying economics). \r\n* For some simple demographics, I’m South Asian, male, and a lacto-vegetarian. I’m also bi and gray-ace/demisexual. Politically, I’m centrist, or slightly left-of-center. I’m an atheist. \r\n* I’m broadly an effective altruist. I’ve been torn about this label before. I’m not too certain about my future plans; I think I will probably apply to masters programs, and then try to work at a research role at an EA org. I have fairly broad interests, so I could see myself working on animal welfare, AI policy/governance, or economic development. \r\n* I’m a bit introverted, although I’m working on being more social. In my spare time, I like reading nonfiction (and blog posts), playing chess online, and participating in competitive British Parliamentary debate (which is an activity I’ve enjoyed a ton). \r\n* I’m very intellectually curious and eager to learn things: I love having long conversations with people about random things I can learn a ton about, including things I know very little about. \r\n* I’m very neat and organized (although I don’t expect that from a partner necessarily). I’m good at replying to texts and emails promptly. When I’m especially interested in a project, I can be quite hardworking, but otherwise my work ethic is poorer than I’d like (this is something I’m working on myself). I don’t have excellent emotional intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for a long-term relationship, but would also love to go on a few dates. I’m open to dating people of any gender. I’d also be open to either monogamy or poly; I have no strong preference on this matter, and would be flexible according to my partner’s preferences. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’d especially value a partner who is interested in making the world a better place, interested in any one of economics/math/political science/statistics, nerdy, and loves long conversations about particular curiosities of theirs. Bonus points if we share hobbies (e.g., debate, playing online chess). I’d also love to share some of our values (either on our political views or on effective altruism – not necessarily both!), but this is not a dealbreaker. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my preferences\r\n\r\n\r\n* I have a low sex drive, and don’t experience a lot of sexual attraction. \r\n* I think it’s unlikely that I will want kids.\r\n* I’m fairly comfortable with long-distance, and I’d be happy to meet/go on a date virtually. But I’d love to meet in-person too. \r\n* I’d want to date someone over 19 but under 30. \r\n\r\n\r\nPictures of me (descriptions below each picture)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m on the left, and that’s my uncle on the right. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding in front of a bookstore. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking at a debate tournament."

      "fullText": "﻿God help me I’m making a date me doc  \r\nAbout me\r\nHello! I’m Lawrence. Here you’ll find some basics about me, what I’m looking for in a relationship, and some of my writing and photos.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasics:\r\n* I'm a 29-year-old straight cis man and 6’3”. \r\n* I live in Berkeley, CA, but I’m not super attached to the Bay Area and I like traveling.\r\n* Looking for a long- or medium-term relationship, open to dating both trans and cis women. \r\n* I don’t know if I want kids. \r\n* I’m open to both polyamorous and monogamous relationships. \r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\n“Lawrence is pretty emotionally mature and insightful in a bunch of ways, and is happy to talk about feelings. [..] I think he might be the best person I know for helping people get over lack of intellectual self-confidence and problems with being intimidated by technical content. [..] He holds himself to very high standards, in a way that can sometimes hurt him but is also often very positive – he’s extremely receptive to feedback and is very non-defensive even when he’s upset. I think he’d be a good match for someone who wants their relationship to be a big source of growth and improvement, but also of security and unconditional affection.” \r\n– Beth Barnes\r\n\r\n\r\n“Man Lawrence, if you have romantic struggles, then there's no hope for the rest of us.”  \r\n– Nat Kozak\r\nMore about me \r\nI often feel intense emotions. I sometimes stop while walking or driving to just take in the view and reflect on how good things are. I get excited about clever ideas and am deeply touched by acts of kindness. I feel on a deep level that most people are very good and are trying their best, and it makes me really sad when they fail or have a rough time. I feel very upset when people are unreasonable, and I often feel a strong desire to fix problems I see around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty good memory. Both for dates and conversations, and for lots of random facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m eager to pick up my partner’s interests. In the past, I’ve enjoyed ballroom dancing, traveling, hiking, cooking together, stargazing, and visiting museums and exhibits. I enjoy talking about machine learning, economics, history, psychology, and random animal facts.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a dog. His name is Benji, and he’s a good boy (not really, but he is a very adorable one). \r\n\r\n\r\nI care deeply about doing good. I want to make both the world around me and the world in general a better place. I’ll stand up for what I think is right, and try to keep promises and be fair to people. (Also, sometimes I stay up all night to help others finish their projects and meet their deadlines.)\r\nWho I tend to get along with\r\nSincerity and kindness: I like people who say true things, genuinely relate to others, and aren’t afraid to wear their heart on their sleeve. I like people who do nice things for others from the depths of their hearts. Also, I think it’s fine to take lots of time and be very gentle when you do it, but I think it’s very important to be able to face hard truths about yourself or the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual curiosity: I like having conversations with a partner where I feel like one or more of us are learning something, or I can share in their enthusiasm and knowledge about a subject. \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh standards: I like people who have high standards and push themselves and their partners to grow and improve.\r\nPossible sources of incompatibility\r\nI can be quite negative. When I’m sad, I often feel like nothing is working; when I fail, I can be quite harsh with myself. I also tend to be lower valence in general, but I’m working on being gentler and happier. I sometimes express true but unkind opinions about others. \r\n\r\n\r\nI work a lot. I think it’s important to be working on productive things, so I tend to be a bit of a homebody by default and I’m not likely to spontaneously develop new hobbies. However, I think that spending time with my partner would definitely count as productive time and I’m happy to spend a lot of time with you!\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t drink or do drugs. I feel comfortable hanging out with people who drink, though I would feel uncomfortable about frequent heavy drinking. I’m also fine with psychedelics as long as you don’t take them in the presence of charismatic cult leaders. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am pretty attached to my dog. If you’re allergic to dogs, this will be a problem. Sorry. \r\n________________\r\nOther Pictures\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nContact Info\r\nIf you’re interested in chatting more or think we’re compatible, please email me at lawrencechan96@gmail.com. \r\n________________\r\nAppendix\r\nSome things I believe about dating docs and dating:\r\nDating docs aren’t (just) for finding dates. I think a significant fraction of the value of dating docs comes from the process of writing; another large fraction comes from communicating information with future partners that might not come up naturally in the first few dates. I’m also not super convinced that dating docs work well for finding new people to date, compared to e.g. asking people out in person. So this doc errs on the side of being more informative as opposed to promotional. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional and social intelligence are real and important. There are many skills in actually making relationships work, both in terms of knowing yourself and in terms of knowing how to relate to others. While I can be a fan of numbers and spreadsheets, it’s important to be in touch with who you are and what you want, and also who your partner is and what they want. Also, communication is important! \r\n\r\n\r\nShared interests are significantly less important than shared values and shared desire to make a relationship work. I think dating apps and docs tend to focus too much on screening for shared interests or experiences, which I think can easily be developed over time. (In particular, I’m happy to pick up your interests! In the past I’ve picked up the interests of previous partners.) On the other hand, deeply held values are probably unlikely to change, and I don’t think romantic relationships work without both parties wanting it to work and putting in the effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost disagreements and issues can be worked through (given shared values and a desire to make the relationship work). I think I have a lot of growth mindset for relationships; I think that many common points of disagreement can be worked on. For example, I think that issues like division of labor (for chores) or different hobbies can generally be solved if both people are willing to try. As a corollary, I think that fights are really bad in romantic relationships; the whole point is to be on the same side, and work toward a mutual goal. Accordingly, I’ve had very few fights in my past romantic relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity is necessary for people to grow in relationships. I personally value relationships that push me to grow and do better, but I don’t think these relationships can be stable without a firm bedrock of security and mutual trust. After all, it’s pretty hard to be ambitious if you feel like a single misstep could cause your partner to leave you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationships can be thought of as trade agreements, but you generally shouldn’t. Relationships are trade agreements (in the sense that every persistent interaction can be thought of as a trade agreement), and this frame can be somewhat helpful. For example, it highlights the fact that relationships should be a positive sum voluntary endeavor, and that both partners should try to provide things that are to their comparative advantage. However, I find that this framing can often cause people to take an adversarial stance toward their partners (i.e. a trade negotiation), or cause people to value tangible, concrete things about their partners over emotional support or vibes, and so don’t think that people should think about relationships this way by default. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional writing samples:\r\nI guess the largest repository my public writing is my LessWrong account: https://www.lesswrong.com/users/lawrencec"

An imposter among all except those who are equally culturally confused. Trained in philosophy, self-taught in everything else. Serious on the outside, goofy on the inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinds the unambitious, parochial life to be humble and beautiful. Finds the world too broken, and himself too privileged or hubristic to accept such a life for himself. Grinds and hustles against the hustle and grindset culture. Always curious about engineering, tinkering, science, but not a techno-optimist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes has “one thought too many,” a character flaw. Speaks mind when probably shouldn’t more often than keeps quiet when probably should speak up. Can be quite direct at times – avoids sugar-coating things. Sets high expectations for self and others. Sometimes struggles to admit when wrong, but eventually does.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking to share the ride with a life-long friend accomplice! Always striving to live more virtuously :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNB: Friends fear this dating profile is “a bit too much.” To which I respond: “but that’s very like me!”\r\nSeeking:\r\nNB: don’t think I’m only interested if you check all boxes! This is just a list of some ideal things I’m looking for. In fact, ideally we should break our ideals as well – surprise each other!\r\n* A co-conspirator. Let’s maybe go save the world? I wish to build beautiful things with my partner, at work and at home. I wish to be involved in my partner’s career, and vice versa. I wish our talents and temperaments to complement each other so as to make us a dynamic duo, a force for good :) I’m currently trying to help “make AI go well.”And save democracy. And other stuff.\r\n* Someone who challenges me. Someone well-studied in their craft or a rigorous thinker. An interest in philosophy, economics, or art are pluses! (Trading in truisms and half-baked things turns me off pretty fast.) But also…\r\n* Someone who knows how and when to shove all that braininess to the side and run down a sand dune! Pull a silly pose! Bask in the moonlight! Or cozy up with a warm cupp :)\r\n* Someone who knows Europe and or America: I’m culturally confused enough as it is, and would rather not become more so... Ideally looking for someone who understands what that’s like, since it’s a key aspect of my identity. I don’t brag my privilege of being well-traveled, and I dislike what I call “cultural tourism” (treating culture like so many colors to embellish one’s instagram feed; taking cultural diversity for granted; failing to care for, own up to, partake in, and embody one’s own culture).\r\nSome things I love:\r\n* Cooking for/with friends, hosting dinner parties, board game nights!\r\n* Tinkering: DIY repair, optics, dance, music. Not good at any of these, love experimenting anyway :)\r\n* Hiking, being in nature\r\n* Reading a poem or watching a great film and then doing a deep dive discussion with others! Off-the-cuff sampling of works I love:\r\n   * Films:\r\n      * Rashomon\r\n      * Parasite\r\n      * Lawrence of Arabia\r\n      * East of Eden\r\n   * Literature:\r\n      * Le Petit Prince\r\n      * Lord of the Flies\r\n      * Brave New World\r\n      * The Cosmicomics\r\n      * (poems by Robert Frost)\r\n      * Calvin and Hobbes\r\n   * Games:\r\n      * Outer Wilds\r\n* Watching some classic Looney Toons or an old comedy with my family (typically Jerry Lewis or Danny Kaye!) ❤\r\n* Playing some silly couch multi-player games with friends or family (Nintendo boy here!) (∩^o^)⊃━☆\r\nDetails:\r\n* Male, straight\r\n* 5’10”\r\n* 29, looking for someone in the ~28-32 range (but not strict about this). I highly value maturity, confidence and resilience in a partner.\r\n* Seeking primary, long-term partner.\r\n* Preference for monogamy mostly because I’m pretty certain my attention/affect would be spread too thin for me in a polyamorous relationship. However, I’m not into possessive exclusivity (I don’t get jealous and feel slightly uncomfortable with people who easily get jealous).\r\n* Demisexual. In the realm of relationships “I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires.” I become loyal very quickly, and I’ve long prioritized intellectual and platonic connections. But it takes me a while to get comfortable with physical touch (something I’m working on). I promise though, I love cuddling :)\r\n* Love languages that currently come easiest: quality time, acts of service\r\n* Mix of intro- and extroverted? Medium-sized social battery? I like meeting new people occasionally, and love hosting or hanging with friends. But after e.g. a fun weekend of full-time social exposure, I need a day or two of quiet to recup. I lean heavily toward quality over quantity of friendships.\r\n* I think I’d like to have children one day, but I have lots of uncertainty here.\r\n* Currently in Boston but pretty flexible: could move to basically any major city in US or EU. Preference for East or West Coast of US, France or UK.\r\n* Fluent in English and French (would love it if you are too!)\r\n* Current work: AI policy researcher, screenwriter.\r\n* B.A. and M.A. in Philosophy\r\n* Vegetarian when I’m ordering, flexitarian otherwise. (Would struggle to live as a vegan: cheese is a strong part of my identity. Could be swayed.)\r\n* Not religious\r\n* Non-smoker, glass of wine on occasions\r\nHow to proceed:\r\nIf you think you’d like to meet, or chat with, feel free to reach out at ctroutcsi@gmail.com, or here on messenger, or text me at 781 518 8996! (I think messenger or text are more reliable, since emails will sometimes go to spam…) If you’d like to learn more about my work/hobbies, feel free to visit www.ctrout.art.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know it can be intimidating to reach out, but of course I made this doc to meet new people, so don’t be shy :)\r\nMore Photos    \r\nDid we mention hubris?"

I studied engineering at Carnegie Mellon before that.\n​​\n​​I’m definitely a nerd, but an outdoorsy one - I enjoy hiking, biking, golf and hosting dinners for friends, as much as going to Green Apple Books, going down Wikipedia rabbit holes and reading about bioreactors and the history of the Russian royal family.\n​​\n​​I love to travel, and bake the best brownies and banana pudding that you’ll eat. I always have snacks on me :)\n​​\n​​Being in touch with my inner self is important to me, I mediate and keep a gratitude journal. I’m more likely to make people groan than laugh - I was voted “teller of the deadliest dad jokes” in college\n​​\n​\n​What next?\n​​If this sounds interesting, reach out and schedule a date!

I'm Anna Crow/Anna Magpie, haven't settled on that yet, a 23-year-old trans woman living in the United Kingdom.\nAs of writing this (1:17am BST, September 5th 2024) I am in the process of attempting to independently fundraise my salary so I can go to Stanford and run a longitudinal study monitoring tens of thousands of different biomarkers on people beginning, then throughout gender affirming hormone therapy, in order to begin to develop a foundational understanding of how to coordinate complex signaling pathways in real world biological systems.\nI am\ncurrently applying to computational biology PhDs mostly in/around London. My core interest is in understanding biology “across scales”. How do we integrate molecular biology data into a coherent whole in order to make useful predictions about disease, with a particular focus on aging. A subquestion I find particularly interesting is the extent to which regulatory networks are defined by complex, non-linear interactions vs simple additive ones. This question has big implications for combination therapies and, more generally, how fast we should expect biomedicine to progress.\nM\ny life is a little up in the air at the moment, I'm currently staying at CEEALAR, but hopefully moving to London sooner rather than later.\nPolyamorous by default. I want to have one or two people that I'm extremely special to, and as long as I feel special to someone I can't bring myself to care about whether they're having sex/romance with other people; monogamous relationships just sound like too much work.\nChronic infodumper, if we date, you can expect rambles on things like\nBiology, especially cellular biology, the mechanisms of aging, and mathematical models of evolution. Evolution is a better engineer than you are and I will tell you exactly why\nMilitary history, I have a particular interest in the development of early semi-automatic firearms, and how this was influenced by institutional thinking around infantry doctrine. However I'm a modern warfare geek in full generality. Also I have strong opinions about people with strong opinions about the F-35.\nAquaculture and ornamental fish. I’m a keen tropical fishkeeper, although I haven't been able to pursue this seriously lately due to the housing constraints associated with being a student.\nIf you also like these topics, that's great, but if not I'm probably happy to listen to you if you ramble as well.\nGenerally eclectic, very into HEMA (Historical fencing with an emphasis on the martial art), bouldering, hanging out in places which have neat people to talk to (hackerspaces, etc.), and photography, almost exclusively wildlife, but someday I'll get into astro (even if you don't do that part with me, it would be great if you accompanied me on the outdoor walks. You will learn about birds and you will enjoy it). I also like to read: Trying desperately to get out of the rationalist monoculture, so have picked up “An experiment in criticism by CS Lewis” and in the middle of “The guns of August”\nI have extremely strong feelings about moral responsibility and individual virtue, especially as they relate to interpersonal relationships. In general I think that the biggest distinction between me and others isn’t intelligence or aptitude, I just care more. I also value serious, precise thinking and try to be fairly ruthless about avoiding what I can best term “vibes based analysis” alongside discouraging it in others. I’ve deliberately cultivated an instinctual uneasiness about hard to falsify claims. I want to date someone who helps me to be a better thinker, a better truthseeker. Stress test my claims, point out when I'm being more of a soldier than a scout and judge me for it, etc.\nMy ideal partner would be someone kind, extroverted and intelligent, who likes when I ramble and can ramble back at me, and enjoys cuddling me and having me occasionally draped over their arm. You should be an independent thinker who tries to avoid uncritically reciting  recieved opinions. Ambitious or at least interested in improving yourself to a similar degree that I am, and willing to help me as I start assembling the life I want outside of university.\nThe tone of this document is possibly a little stand-offish, that's just my writing style. I am an extroverted, 6’5” trans woman with motor coordination issues; this makes me an inherently ridiculous person. I\ncan't\ntake myself too seriously. “Bouncy” probably captures my default orientation in most social settings.

      "fullText": "﻿David’s Dating profile\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSummary\r\nI am a disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m an assistant professor working on Bayesian social and formal epistemology, the philosophy of AI, and the foundations of physics. Somehow I have ended up with two PhDs, one in particle physics, and one in the philosophy of science. I am something of a polymath. My Erdős number is less than or equal to four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kind, thoughtful and curious. I am excited by, and open to new ideas. I strongly value openness and honesty. I am shy, introverted and almost certainly terribly socially awkward. I am a neurodivergent trainwreck. I am often found at the epicentre of a whirling void of chaos, but this is just by coincidence. Imagine a confused and profusely apologetic teacher running in late to teach their class, and dropping their books everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am vegan, somewhere on the (highly heterodox) left politically, feminist, and very loosely adjacent to (or aligned with?) effective altruism and rationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am (very) British. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important to realise that I am definitely not “fun”. Don't even *think* about trying to take me on an “adventure”.\r\nInterests\r\nMy interests are rather eclectic. I particularly enjoy discovering new, elegant and holistic ideas that simplify and unify a great many threads: this applies not just in physics, but in every field of human knowledge. A selective summary of some things I often think about might include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Physics – especially quantum field theory and particle physics. \r\n* Philosophy – my specialisms are in formal and social epistemology and the philosophy of science, but let’s face it, every area of philosophy is almost definitionally interesting.\r\n* Rationality and Bayesianism.\r\n* Cognitive science and artificial intelligence – obviously.\r\n* Why isn’t my code compiling?\r\n* Politics/economics/sociology. \r\n* History.\r\n* Music and music theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, please let me stress this list is non-exhaustive. I am generally very fascinated by other topics as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder at the nature of time, space and the cosmos. I marvel at the mysteries of human history and the patterns exhibited in human societies, minds, biological structures and other complex systems, deconstructing and analysing the various media of human culture. I am particularly fascinated by the problems of epistemology, and other areas of philosophy. How should we interpret quantum field theories? Is it possible that the Universe is deterministic? What does it mean for A to cause B, and does that imply a direction in time? What makes time so different from the dimensions of space? When are two scientific theories equivalent? Is scientific knowledge cumulative? How can we justify the use of Occam's razor in induction? How important is the \"look elsewhere effect\"? Why does anything exist at all? How strong is the anthropic principle? Is a high level of artificial intelligence imminent and what are its implications for society and the economy? Should we aspire to have a society without work? Is it OK to have incommensurable moral values? How culturally contingent is the modern, Western ideal of liberty? Is it possible to improve human happiness or are we stuck on a hedonic treadmill? Also, how can we save the political left in Western Europe in a time of globalisation, secular stagnation, and a resurgent China? Is the Eurozone doomed? How can we save the Labour party from itself? A question possibly more intractable than anything else posed here! When I am out and about, I often think about urban design, public spaces, and architecture too. Or I mull over post-Soviet hauntology. I particularly enjoy discovering new, elegant and holistic ideas that simplify and unify a great many threads: this applies not just in physics, but in every field of human knowledge. There are, I think, few forms of happiness greater than the satisfaction that arises from the creative application of thought to a problem and discovering a brilliant solution. I love being introduced to new ideas, so if you think you know something that would interest me, please do share it!\r\nPersonality\r\n* INTJ-T or INTP-T depending on the test (I treat Myers–Briggs as a convenient summarising tool rather than a highly credible scientific model). \r\n* Presumably Ravenclaw (obviously a much more objective model).\r\n* Neutral Good alignment.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed I’m quite eccentric. I generally have a very high willingness to deviate from social norms, and I’m usually unphased by weirdness in other people. In some ways, I might take this too far: I instinctively veer away from groupthink, tribalism or veneration/idolization, in a way that probably can make me seem disagreeable. I seem unusually disinclined to naturally align my opinions or attitudes towards those of other people around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sprinkle a lot of what I say with very subtle and dry humour, which very few people understand or notice. From this, you should probably conclude that I'm actually not very funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very open to new ideas, and generally curious. I am very much a high-decoupling thinker, although I see the value of being able to think in a low-decoupling way too. I do enjoy exploring ideas in a way that can sometimes come across as unintentionally controversial or provocative. I can comfortably suppress this, but I think I get on best with people who also enjoy thinking in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kind, patient and good at listening. I am generally very forgiving of mistakes, and tend not to hold grudges against others.  I highly value kindness and magnanimity in other people. I don’t tend to take differences of opinions personally, and I am very open to criticism. I don’t tend to get angry easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nI strongly value openness and honesty, and I get on best with people who also share these values. I like to build relationships on intimacy and trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can dislike people who are very loud, arrogant or domineering. I am generally very sensitive to power-balances between people. I have a streak of culturally puritanical moralism. I like integrity, authenticity, and the calm search for enlightenment. I dislike extravagance, gaudiness, and unjustified grandiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like my life to be zen. I do not tend to get on well with high-drama people. I am a good demonstration of Karl Friston’s Free Energy principle because I try to avoid surprises, both good and bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am usually very polite and obliging to the needs of other people. But I mostly prefer it if people are willing to openly assert their needs and desires. I strongly adhere to “ask culture”. However, occasionally I can overthink things, in a way to ensure I do not inadvertently pressure or harm other people. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very ambitious and motivated. People tend to perceive me as something of a workaholic; however, this is only the case with work I passionately enjoy, or am very stressed about. I am a terrible procrastinator at everything else, especially anything involving admin. I can be very strong-willed on certain things; unfortunately motivating myself to do things I find tedious is not one of them. Some people find that I can be very stubborn; like some non-Newtonian fluids, my rigidity can increase under pressure.\r\nPsychology\r\nSometimes I feel like the fated star-child, but then the camera dolly-zooms, and in a dizzying gestalt shift I realise that I am actually a barely-functional human being. It bemuses me that some people find this profile intimidating, because in truth I am usually a chaotic mess, stumbling from one fiasco to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, I am “neurodivergent”. I think I am autistic (self-diagnosed), I have ADHD (sort-of diagnosed) and I am dyspraxic (actually diagnosed!). The possibility that I might have ADHD only occurred a few years ago (I had a complete misconception of what this was); since then I have been taking vyvanse/elvanse (lisdexamfetamine), which has improved my life incredibly. The only comparable experience I can think of is when I first put on glasses. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this, I am mostly a scatter-brained, highly forgetful disaster. I am naturally fairly incompetent at most basic day-to-day tasks. I do my best, but my best is usually pretty terrible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I probably haven’t mentioned this yet, but I am also highly forgetful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of many types of social interactions, I am pretty spectacularly awkward. I am usually better one-on-one than in groups, but I generally prefer large groups to small groups (more opportunities to hide). I am very introverted, by which I mean I tend to find social interaction very exhausting. This decreases when I grow more comfortable with someone, but usually it is still somewhat tiring. However, I actually really love exploring getting to know interesting people, and I generally do enjoy and value social interaction. I’m just able to do much less of it than some people, and need a lot of time to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, I think I am actually very good at intuitively understanding and emotionally reading people. This is something that I have never found difficult. However, there are probably some social conventions that I miss or don’t understand. That being said, I don’t think my understanding is all that bad: there are some advantages to viewing things as an outsider, a sort of alien anthropologist. (But of course, I might not know what I don’t know!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have high levels of anxiety overall. This is very much lower than it used to be, but is probably higher than average. I had OCD as a teenager, and still have some mild OCD tendencies (yes, I am mildly triggered by the poor alignment of the images at the top of this profile). In the past, I have experienced some mental health problems including depression. In recent years, I’ve been remarkably happy and mentally healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last seven or eight years, I have felt increasingly more alive, and reinvigorated. A lot of my mental health problems have become less severe in one way or another. I have gradually been learning to fall back in love with myself. This has been an extremely romantic process.\r\nPhysicality\r\nPhysically speaking, you could describe me as an organic, self-organising, irreversible, dynamic, non-linear, open, dissipative system, far from thermal equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s not what you were looking for? Fine, fine, if you really insist, here are some more “salient” features. I am:\r\n\r\n\r\n* 34 years old\r\n* Anatomically male\r\n* British (obviously)\r\n* Average height (around 175cm, or 5 feet, 9 inches tall)\r\n* Average weight (with a bmi around 23 at the time of writing)\r\n* Presumably not unfit (I am a fast walker, and I run 6 days a week)\r\n* In no way \"in shape\", unless the shape you have in mind is some sort of blobitectural abomination (perhaps a Gömböc?)\r\n* Physically healthy (except for very mild asthma)\r\n* White/caucasian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have:\r\n* Green-brown eyes\r\n* Disaster hair\r\n* Glasses due to being short-sighted.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can probably infer my approximate appearance from the pictures, some of which were even taken within the last decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Things\r\nI am genuinely (yes, genuinely) open to forming many kinds of new connections, or just seeing how things evolve. That could include forming friendships, relationships, or other things. However, I would prefer to meet people without strong expectations or assumptions about a relationship escalator.\r\n\r\n\r\nI quite like the polyamory model, and my prior experience with it has generally been successful.  I would be open to various relationship models ranging from monogamy to relationship anarchy, with the right person or people. I see pros and cons of different models. Overall, this is something I am more pragmatic about than ideological, and in general I am fairly flexible. One partner said (perhaps accurately) that I was too much of a relationship anarchist to ever identify as one.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. I do have some ongoing entanglements, so I may not be compatible with very strict forms of monogamy. I am open to looser forms of monogamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of the particular model, I try to form relationships on as rational a basis as possible, allowing a particular arrangement to develop naturally between individuals. I very much tend to view each friendship/relationship on its own terms, which means that they often don't fit easily into socially-established categories. Genuine communication is essential. Again, I take openness and honesty as very fundamental prerequisites for being able to interact with other people in the most positive possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to dislike “new relationship energy”, and don’t experience this as strongly as some people seem to. I experience very little immediate attraction to people, rather this grows gradually as a relationship develops and we build a connection. I can be quite romantic and value intimacy very highly once I become close to someone. However, for me, I find that romantic feelings are mutually, consciously cultivated; I never really “fall” for people spontaneously. I like relationships to evolve slowly, and grow stronger over time. \r\n\r\n\r\nI find physical intimacy to be an important and valuable feature of relationships. That does not have to be sexual (I have had successful and happy relationships with asexual people). I find sexual activity to be a highly unique experience with every person; it is something I prefer to take slowly and gradually evolve. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe gender of a partner is not an important component in degree of attraction towards them. In that sense, I am happy to identify as “bisexual” or “pansexual” or “queer”, whichever is most conducive to good vibes or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dislike uneven power dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my relationships, career, finances, social setting etc are all in good shape, I would certainly consider having children with a suitable partner or partners. \r\nIdeologies and Identities\r\nI am generally fairly anti-tribalist, and don’t easily fully align with any groups. I tend to adopt far too many heretical views. Nonetheless, I’ll do my best to situate myself within the broad ideological contours of the contemporary moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find politics interesting, and appreciate the importance of both policy and realpolitik. Overall, I broadly lie on the pluralist, progressive left, although this varies quite considerably, depending on contexts and issues. Economically, I sit somewhere between radical social democracy and market-oriented democratic socialism. Constitutionally and socially, I am very much a liberal, or perhaps more accurately I increasingly identify with classical civic republicanism. However, my views on particular policies and parties can be surprising; I instinctively avoid tribalism and political dogma, and try to borrow widely from a range of ideas. I am generally cautious of overarching grand narratives or overly simple ideological frameworks. I have some sympathy towards radical aims, but try to be pragmatic in my views on how to achieve them. I think democracy, liberty, equality, and constitutionalism are all good ideas, and many of the most interesting questions are about the best way to reconcile them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of political parties, I currently most closely align with the soft left of the Labour party in the U.K., though I’m rather hard to classify. Apparently (contrary to my claims in the previous section) I have some repressed masochistic inclinations because I’m still a Labour party member.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very much a feminist, mostly influenced by some ad hoc mixture of radical and intersectional ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a culture wars irenicist, in that I think the culture war itself is bad and harmful. However, I am exasperated by both sides of these battles. Overall, my views are idiosyncratically radically progressive, but in some ways also quite culturally conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very much a philosopher in every sense of the word (although please be very careful, because I am mildly allergic to metaphysics). Insofar as I have a philosophical project, it draws from the traditions of logical empiricism, subjective Bayesianism and Skyrmsian naturalism. And of course, I am very dedicated to physics (although our facebook relationship status is currently set to “it's complicated”). I still lean towards some sort of hidden variables approach to quantum mechanics (in spite of my scientific anti-realism). I do see the appeal of an Everettian interpretation, but I have some deep, unresolved doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEthically, I have some sympathies with a utilitarian stance, but I may not be purely utilitarian. Decision theoretically, my views are not very settled, although I am not a naive causal decision theorist. Worryingly, I am not fully decided about whether that pushes me towards a sophisticated evidential decision theory, or some form of timeless decision theory. Either way, that means that my practical ethics looks a lot more deontological in practice than some utilitarians: I will cooperate in a twin prisoner’s dilemma!\r\n\r\n\r\nI am ontologically atheist, tropologically spiritual and theologically noncognitivist.\r\n\r\n\r\nI broadly align with the fundamentals of the rationalist, post-rationalist and effective altruist approaches. They are fonts of absolutely incredible ideas. That being said, I harbour quite severe doubts about the epistemic and social health of the movements themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nLists of Things\r\n(The purpose of these lists is to give a flavour. They're not intended to be exhaustive!)\r\nLiterature\r\nContemporary:\r\nMargaret Atwood; Hilary Mantel; Kazuo Ishiguro; Jorge Luis Borges; Ian McEwan; Haruki Murakami; Umberto Eco; Graham Greene; John le Carré.\r\nClassical:\r\nFyodor Dostoyevsky; George Eliot; Thomas Hardy; Jane Austen.\r\nMultigenerational civilizational fantasy and science fiction epics:\r\nThe Hainish Cycle; the Foundation series; A Canticle for Leibowitz; the Dune Series; A Song of Ice and Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time, ADHD made me a very slow reader. It wasn’t that I didn’t enjoy reading, but that I found it overly-exciting, and my mind would keep wandering off, stimulated by the ideas. In recent years, medication, audio books, and better mastery of my symptoms have helped a great deal, and I’ve started consuming a lot more. But this means there are many gaps that I would like to fill.\r\nNonfiction\r\nGodel, Escher, Bach; The Selfish Gene; Thinking Fast and Slow; Capital in the 21st Century; Seeing Like a State; Mathematical Games by Martin Gardner; Physics textbooks by David Griffiths, James Binney or James Blundel.\r\nMusic\r\nClassical\r\nMozart; Beethoven; Bach; Sibelius; Janáček; Tchaikovsky; Bruckner; Mahler; Wagner (yes); Howells; Mendelssohn; Schubert; Prokofiev; Rachmaninov; Rimsky-Korsakov; Dvorak; Khachaturian; Byrd; Tallis; Pärt; Poulenc; Pergolesi.\r\nSymphonic/Power/Folk Metal\r\nNightwish; Turisas; Sabaton; Blind Guardian; Helion Prime; Dragonforce.\r\nMiscellanea\r\nA lot of jazz and related genres: Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis. Sometimes I become temporarily fascinated by other particular genres of music: classical Hindustani ragas, maqam, klezmer, isochronic tones, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to play clarinet, violin and trumpet, and I did choral singing for a while. To my eternal shame, I haven’t kept up with these. But music remains extremely important to me, somewhere close to my soul.\r\nVideo Games\r\nI play Age of Empires II online regularly with a group of friends (Elo ~ 1400 #humblebrag). Other games I enjoy or have enjoyed include:\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Victoria; the Civilization Series; Cities Skylines; Rimworld; Factorio; Open TTD; Disco Elysium; Pentiment; the Baldur’s Gate series; Planescape Torment; Monkey Island; Grim Fandango; Chrono Trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to go through long periods of not playing any games. But when my mental reserves run to zero, sometimes some part of my brain rebels, and I become fixated on a game for a little while, before I recover.\r\nFilms\r\nI don’t watch many. Some that I enjoy include: \r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty; anything by Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli; Pan's Labyrinth; Schindler's List.\r\nBroadcast media\r\nI don’t consume very much broadcast media.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarl Sagan's Cosmos; documentaries by Adam Curtis; Bryan Magee's wonderful interviews; most things on BBC Radio 4.\r\nYoutube Channels\r\n3Blue1Brown; PBS Spacetime; Kurzgesagt; CGP Grey; Maiorianus; Voices of the Past.\r\nBlogs\r\nAzimuth; Astral Codex Ten; A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry; Stumbling and Mumbling; Mainly Macro; Noapinion; Shtetl-Optimized; whatever Wolfram is doing; Chartbook; Age of Invention; Scientific Discovery.\r\nFood\r\nI am almost entirely vegan and strictly vegetarian. Beyond that, I am fairly flexible. Some of my favourite foods include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Chocolate.\r\nA Perfect Day\r\nIn the golden light of the dawn, I head to the gymnasium, its tall, firm Corinthian columns silhouetted against the morning sun. I debate with the other great philosophers as we watch the naked male youths wrestle in the palaestra. Their lithe forms glisten with perspiration, as they dance in tandem, mind and body in exquisite harmony. With the day's exertion done, I wander back to my oikos, where I am hosting a symposium, with all the foremost intelligentsia of the polis. We discuss the great unsolved mysteries of life, the Universe and everything, tiring away the sun with our talk. Finally, with our rhytons drained, the guests wander out into the evening's lengthening shadows. I fall into the smooth, strong curves of my beloved Antinous, resting my head against his slender — yet exquisitely toned — chest, and drift into the embrace of the still midnight... sorry, what were you asking again?\r\nContact Details\r\nSo you’ve read everything up to here (well OK maybe not everything…). And you want to get in touch? Are you sure about that?\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Yes, now give me the contact details!”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be friends or date, or something related, you can email me at:\r\ndafidius [AT] gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like receiving messages from people. (Even if I don’t reply, I genuinely promise that I almost certainly enjoyed receiving your message! I have never received a response to this profile that I didn’t enjoy reading.) I’m very shy so you should probably message me first. But if you really don’t know what to write, you could just send a link to your own dating profile, thereby putting the onus on me.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find my manifold.love profile here.\r\nYou can also find my OKCupid profile here.\r\nAll my dating profiles (including this catastrophe of a date-me page) should be regarded as being “under construction”.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can add me as a friend on facebook here, although I don’t use the site very actively.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you really want, you can see my academic website here. However, if possible, try not to send dating messages to my academic email addresses! [Warning: very out of date. I really need to update it, but I hate doing so.]\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Obviously I don’t want to message you! Someone like you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might want to investigate these lists of dating profiles, which have a relatively high density of people I find interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n* “I don’t want to date or even be friends, but I really need you to read my 30,000 page THEORY OF EVERYTHING, explaining why Einstein Was Wrong and the Physics Establishment are suppressing my revolutionary ideas!”\r\n\r\nThe best way to get my attention is to email that to my special email address here. And I promise to get back to you just as soon as I’ve finished reading your theory…\r\n\r\n\r\n* “Actually, I don’t want to contact you at all…”\r\n\r\nProbably a good decision! You have gained 200 XP."

I think I’m pretty cool.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Tara and I’m a former TV exec turned author turned…Idk, I just really want to remind people of their self-worth. That has become my job and it’s truly a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m looking for someone KIND, thoughtful, affectionate, smart, passionate about something (maybe me?), spiritual, with a great sense of humor and a willingness to evolve and change. Oh, and be playful! Bonus points if you’re Jewish but not a deal breaker :) My favorite thing is to learn and I hope you teach me a lot. Also. I can let loose. A trip to Vegas is always in the cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am oddly obsessed with Formula 1 Racing. Monte Carlo, anyone?!\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in Los Angeles and am seriously contemplating a move to the Bay Area. Why? I need trees!!!!! I also need to date people who don’t work in Hollywood. I want a smarty-pants-nerd affection-dream who loves to be active, get out into nature, but is equally comfortable in Zion as they are at an Oscars party (which - I don’t get invited to anymore, buyer beware). All about the high-low, yin-yang. \r\n\r\n\r\nKids? I need the partner first! Growing up was not fun for me and so I want to make sure my partner and I are evolved enough and in love enough to bring new souls into the world. So, I’m open to kids but I need the guy first. Maybe it’s you? Idk. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope it’s you because I have a lot of love to give someone special :) AWWWW\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI have really good skin and you can email me at Tara.Schuster@gmail.com and this is my IG: https://www.instagram.com/taraschuster/?hl=en"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\nYou’re almost there — sign up to start building in Notion today.\nSign up or login\n🦆\nDate Kaushik Donthi (Me)\nShare\n🦆\nDate Kaushik Donthi (Me)\nTable of contents\nProblem statement\nGoals\nNon-goals\nProposed solution\nInterests and Hobbies\nValues\nPictures\nSuccess Criteria\nImplementation and rollout plan\nProblem statement\nI decided to use one of the Engineering solution templates from Notion, so my problem is figuring out how to use this without making people think I need a group of overpaid college graduates to fix me.\nBut really, my goal is to find a loving, rewarding relationship with a female I am interested in and for whom I am willing to sacrifice the time necessary to build a relationship. Someone who is kind, intelligent, silly, curious, courageous, and empathetic. And very importantly, someone who is emotionally mature enough to realize the kind of work and sacrifices that a relationship entails.\nI am pretty flexible about the actual location, since my job is usually remote. Buttt I am a sucker for good weather - I’ve lived in the Bay Area for most of my life and in Malaga, Spain for a little bit so I am not going to pretend that living in Norway would be perfect for me. But love transcends all, right? 😛 I’ll try to use some of the existing fields in this template that I find are surprisingly appropriate or just funny.\nGoals\nIdeally - find someone who is compatible with me in a relationship sense by showing them this document and some pictures of me, at which point they will fall hopelessly in love.\nNon-goals\nMeeting more guys. Just kidding! If you think we would be two cubes in an ice tray, regardless of what your gender is, then totally message me and we can haaanggg. See “Implementation and Rollout Plan” for contact details.\nProposed solution\nMeet a lot more girls with the openness to a relationship or just a friendship depending on how we feel about each other. I see either as a win, but I want to be clear that my intention going into a meeting is 80% to date and 20% to be friends. To be clear, I love having a relationship that has the foundation of a friendship. But I am not sure how this is possible unless we read this doc, signed a binding contract to be friends, erased our memories, and then one day felt that we could be more.\nI think it’s easier going from “Ah I don’t see this working out as a relationship, but we can totally drink boba like every 5 weeks” rather than “Hey we drink boba like every 5 weeks, but I want to see you again tomorrow.”\nInterests and Hobbies\nProgramming - I am a software engineer who has worked for blockchain companies (trading and gaming-related) and I am extremely grateful that I truly enjoy my work! I love building things with an end customer in mind and I find it awesome that solving cool problems can make peoples’ lives better. Somehow, I think the universe was beautifully designed that way.\nMath/Physics\nI kind of have this weird liking for math competition problems and I think it is so beautiful how we can create abstractions to describe the physical world\nI have explored ML, but I frankly don’t really like things that are that much of a black box to the point where we are just working backwards to find the motivation from the implementation\nI used to be really bad at physics in high school and kind of hated it, but in college I decided to try to do my best and I actually ended up really liking it and I was a teaching assistant for a couple of physics classes\nStrategy Games\nReally Like\nCatan (I love the 1v1 version of Colonist, I was ranked Diamond two seasons ago and btw the username is from Looking for Alaska by John Green haha)\nSecret Hitler\nSoccer\nLove/Hate\nChess\nTennis (love watching it though)\nHate\nUno (is this even strategy?)\nLosing (in honesty, I can get pretty competitive sometimes haha)\nBeing active\nRunning\nSwimming Way Too Deep in the Ocean (SWTDO)\nRowing\nComedy\nImprov (for me, humor compatibility in a relationship is huge and if I can do a bit with you, that is a huge plus)\nConan O’Brien <3\nValues\nHonesty\nI am the kind of person who tries to say what is on his mind in a compassionate, caring way towards myself and others\nI think short-term discomfort is worth long-term growth\nI really resonate with the quote from the Kite Runner, “That's the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.” It just means to me that if we both trust ourselves to be honest, we can assume good intention and it just makes things soooooo much easier (and we can also move much faster haha!)\nGentleness/Kindness\nI don’t feel like a man needs to be “assertive” or “dominant”; I think being gentle and kind is strong in it’s own way\nI think being kind and loving and holding someone’s heart with care are so much more important and I want to be with someone who values the care I give to them\nFighting Well\nI think in a relationship fights are inevitable, but I think healthy relationships fight well\nPhysical violence is not okay, as are demeaning comments\nWe try to argue our points to the best of our knowledge and acknowledge good points from the other side\nWe are both mentally healthy enough that we do our best to make it work but have the power to walk away at any time\nHealth\nI have become much healthier over the last 7 or 8 years and I would love to meet someone who also cares about what they put in their body\nI love to exercise on a regular basis, whether it is swimming, running, rowing, or playing soccer\nI don’t expect my partner to be interested in the same activities (I guess this goes for really everything I’ve said so far haha)\nAlso pretty into meditation, although my view on its importance has changed a lot over the past few years\nSelfish Altruism with a Mix of Loving Without Expectation\nI think it is important to figure out what brings you joy and how you can use that to bring joy to others\nBare altruism is rarely a good long-term goal - how many vegetarians/vegans have you met who did it for the sake of the world but gave up because of how futile they felt their attempts were in making a dent in the animal consumption problem?\nFor me, becoming almost fully vegetarian/vegan was a decision inspired by my getting healthier and looking better\nBut I think loving yourself allows you to love others best :); and loving without expectation is the best way to show up in life and in a relationship - that love doesn’t have any promises; you just have to be grateful for every moment, and enjoy every single moment\nCuriosity/Playfulness\nI love being just fun and silly and weird and my humor can be dirty sometimes with people I feel comfortable with, and I hope to find someone I can play with for the rest of my life\nI think that the universe is somehow inherently playful - it does without any purpose and it rewards joy and spreading happiness\nI think everything is connected from chess to physics to swimming to flowers and I love to find and think about these connections\nBelief/Confidence/Ambition\nI truly believe that the universe works with you on goals you really believe in and that the universe responds when you ask it for something and put a full-hearted effort into it\nI think working towards goals that ignite us is what we live for and it’s important to me that my partner is decently ambitious as well\nPhysical Connection\nPhysical touch is one of my love languages, so I would ideally like to be with someone who also likes that :)\nI think sex to me is a part of expressing love in a relationship, and while it shouldn’t be at the forefront of what’s going on, I think it’s important that there is good physical compatibility\nI don’t think about sex that much at all, unfortunately, so I can tend to be bad at initiating; however, this is something I am happy to work on\nPictures\nAnd here are some (silly) pictures of me! I guess if I had to describe myself, I am a 5’ 10.5’’ guy who tends to be kind of skinnier/toned side. A lot of these are in Europe (I lived in Spain for a bit last year!) and I switch a lot between having and not having a beard, so I’ll include pictures of both 🙂\nI didn’t even get to go to the top :,) But maybe we can?\nALT\nYeah I guess you could say I get a lot of kudos\nALT\nWhat’s up with my posture lmao\nALT\nDon’t show this to my mom (I’m a momma’s boy if you couldn’t tell)\nALT\nJust for balance, a picture my mom probably likes\nALT\nSuccess Criteria\nHow will you validate the solution is working correctly?\nHopefully, we can be very open with each other if we think things are working out. I am sometimes really good but otherwise hopelessly lost in reading signs from girls.\nI also don’t want to waste either of our time - I think a relationship is an opportunity cost and I hope that we are both gaining something from our time together to make up for it.\nWhat monitoring and alerting will you do to ensure this project doesn’t decrease performance and reliability?\nI will constantly ask ChatGPT 4.5 to tell me what I am doing wrong\nImplementation and rollout plan\nIf you read all that and you think you still want to meet me, I guess maybe you’re pretty cool yourself.\nHaha, did you actually fall for this big pile of steaming …? Okay sorry, like I said my humor can be a bit strange sometimes. Hopefully, you didn’t actually stop reading. Or if everyone stopped reading, would anyone ever read this? I wonder if I could just write whatever I wanted down here. Like YO MAMMA IS SO FAT, THAT SHE GOES THROUGH A LUNAR CYCLE EVERY TIME SHE PIROUETTES. Who said my jokes were good?\nJeez, okay… I will try to be serious for like 20 seconds. If you think we would be a good fit, text me at (plus one) five one zero, seven seven one, four nine one four. Or email me at kaushikdr@gmail.com. Or do both?"

      "fullText": "﻿Why should I date Watson?            \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral info\r\nHi, I’m Watson. I’ve lived  in Emeryville California and environs for a decade but I come from New Jersey.  I studied math at Chicago (class of 2013) and at Berkeley (graduated 2018).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specific info\r\nLooking for a long term nesting partner of any gender. I am a poly, kinky, switch, bisexual cis man open to having or adopting children.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen asked to give three words about me my long-term partner said “effusive, kind, gentle”. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpend a day with Watson\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently I work from home. My work life balance is good. In the evenings I like to practice my ukulele, ride my bike, or watch a classic film at the Roxie.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve had the good fortune to have gone sailing with my father a bunch of times: including across the Pacific. I like to hike everything from evening walks in Claremont Canyon to multi day traverses of mountain ranges. I enjoy skiing at Kirkwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sometimes go to science fiction conventions where I sing and play the ukulele, and sometimes perform my own songs or do covers of classic filk songs (Filk is the folk music of science fiction fandom)\r\n\r\n\r\nI read really fast because I’m autistic and hyperlexic. I like to discuss literature and films and spend too much time on the Internet. I also play a lot of board games and DM my own D&D campaign.\r\nWho you are\r\nYou are open-minded and supportive, creative, and caring. You are willing to take the time to get on the same wavelength, and you enjoy beautiful places, art, music, literature and terrible puns.\r\nWhy shouldn’t I date Watson?\r\nReligion, sex, and politics\r\nReligion: I’m Jewish and it’s very important to me. I go to a synagogue on many Friday nights, and aspire to learn to read Torah and Aramaic to study Talmud. I don’t keep Shabbat, or kosher, and I am willing to touch people of other genders. I am mostly a cultural Jew but I do like to be active in my local Jewish community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSex: I am bisexual, poly, kinky, and switchy, 40/60 top/bottom. Very dependent on dynamic: some have leaned more one side than the other. I love rope and impact play. I would love to expand my skill set and am open to going to events and classes together.\r\n\r\nPolitics: I’m a right Heglian now, after a misspent youth pursuing Trotskyism in the form of Postonian Freudo-Marxism. A far cry from the logical atomism someone said I radiated early in my college career. I vote democratic and am involved in local YIMBY (yes in my backyard) activism.\r\nMental health\r\nI am more motivated to do things when my friends or partners are involved. I have a lot of inertia towards projects or plans that only involve myself. Nevertheless when I have the energy I’ll happily go out and plot adventures for a whole group of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can react strongly, especially when things are going wrong, as well as find it hard to ask for help and sometimes beat myself up.. The best way to snap me out of it is to be kind to me and offer a hug.\r\nPhysical health\r\nI have a rare genetic disorder that makes small bumps on my face and scalp. If you zoom in on the photos you can see them. They are harmless and easily treated. I am also very tall (6’ 4”) I enjoy weight lifting and biking. I am happy to reach things on high shelves.\r\nOther relationships\r\nI have a long distance partner I’m emotionally close to and visit several times a year for a week or so at a time. She also visits me. I date two other people at irregular intervals and have been for a long time.\r\nLocation\r\nI live in paradise (Northern California) , and see no reason to change it.\r\nHow to find Watson\r\nMy email is watsonbladd@gmail.com, or text me at 201-213-9379, FB messenger or Signal work better than email: my inbox is often crowded.\r\n\r\nIf I don’t respond, please text again. I want to hear from you."

      "fullText": "﻿Gina Stuessy’s Dating Profile\r\nLast updated: July 2024 / minorly Jan 2025\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nI’m a straight woman, poly, living in Berkeley, California with my 16-yr-old cat and a (human) housemate.\r\nI’m mostly looking for a primary partner, but would start any relationship out casually/see if we get along as friends. I don’t want to have kids—open to trying out being with someone who already has them, though. Not interested in dating people outside of the SF Bay Area, i.e. starting to get to know each other only virtually.\r\nI work in operations and finance, currently (and for 9 years) at Animal Charity Evaluators. Was previously a software and applications engineer.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     \r\nThese are from Nov 2020 (sea lions!), May 2022, June 2022 (climbing), Oct 2022 (staff retreat in D.C.), and June 2023 (trip to Mendocino, CA), in that order. There are more pictures on Facebook.\r\nMore Details\r\nPeople close to me have recognized that I’m especially: (i) curious—about people and ideas, “gearsy thinking”, one called it, (ii) literal, (iii) trustworthy—I generally do what I say I will, and (iv) caring. So if you’re a very private person or need me to get all your meta-messages, it probs won’t work out. Myers-Briggs (but from almost a decade ago): ISTJ\r\nWhat’s most important to me; unlikely to change:\r\n* Involvement in effective altruism (since 2013)\r\n* Involvement in animal advocacy (since 2011)\r\n* Getting outside quite frequently\r\n* Staying relatively healthy, e.g. through regular exercise, decent diet, and taking mental health seriously\r\n* Seeing friends and family\r\n* Cryonics\r\n* Non-religious\r\n* Making lists :)\r\nSome current hobbies and interests:\r\n* Climbing indoors and outdoors, hiking, tennis\r\n* Singing\r\n* Variety of social events: games, parties, small gatherings, hosting themed dinners\r\n* Travel, especially to a new country once or twice a year\r\n* Podcasts, articles, books on psychology, economics, critical thinking, rationality\r\nWhat I Want in Relationships\r\nI’m mostly looking for a long-term primary partner, but would start any relationship out casually/see if we get along as friends. I’m also open to shorter-term and/or less serious dating.[1] I’ll describe what I’d like for each type of relationship in the sections below.\r\nPrimary Partner\r\nThis is what I’d like to be heading toward eventually, though some pieces (like values alignment) are more likely to be there from the start.\r\nValues alignment: I’d like a long-term partnership where we are quite aligned on values like effective altruism, and where we’re both working on something that is expected to be pretty high-impact.\r\nLove, support/growth: We would support each other emotionally, and also actively encourage and support each other in reaching our goals to become happier, stronger, better people living in alignment with our values. We would have a lot of love and care for each other, and show our love physically, through words, and by spending time together (and maybe other ways!). We’d celebrate each others’ joys and be there to support each other during tough times.\r\nCommunication: We would be honest, open, and have meta discussions about our relationship and ways we can improve it. Giving and receiving feedback can be stressful, but we would learn how best to communicate critical feedback in ways that lessens or eliminates the hurt the other person feels (which could be specific to the person).\r\nCommitment, security: In a serious relationship, we’re both really willing to put in work to keep the relationship good, or to work through a set back, whether it be about the relationship or one of our own struggles. We would share what we need from each other in order to feel secure in our relationship. Even little things (like appreciating time spent together) can make a big difference.\r\nIn tune, emotionally aware: We would stay updated on what is going on in each other’s lives, e.g. so that we can proactively support each other. We would notice and be able to read each other’s emotions to an increasing extent, and respond appropriately.\r\nLogistics: I’d like to live together with a primary partner, and I currently like living in the SF Bay Area. I don’t want kids. I’d really like it if we didn’t have meat or eggs in our place.[2] \r\nSome preferred activities:\r\n* Cuddle ~daily\r\n* Exercise together weekly or more\r\n* Travel together (especially places where we can see wildlife)\r\n* Try out new activities together\r\n* Discuss interesting things we’ve read/learned\r\n* Work on an intellectually-stimulating project together\r\n* Do stuff with friends together\r\nLikes in a partner:\r\n* Has at least some experience with long-term relationships (my two longest: over fifteen years and about four years)\r\n* Working on something you believe is really important for improving the world\r\n* Vegan\r\n* 27–48 years old (though this isn’t a strict range)\r\n* Has some interests/activities in common\r\n* Attempts to live relatively healthy\r\n🚩Red flags for primary partners 🚩:\r\n* Smoking cigarettes\r\n* Strong belief in pseudoscience things like astrology and healing from crystals\r\n* Wanting to keep gun(s) at our place (if we lived together)\r\n* Often being easily agitated or aggressive\r\nShorter-term and/or Less Serious Dating\r\nI’m also open to less serious dating, and don’t need as much alignment with people I date less seriously. Just communicate about what sort(s) of relationships you want, if you know :) \r\nConnect With Me\r\nIf you’d like to get to know me better or just have something to say to me after reading this, feel free to Facebook message me or text/WhatsApp/Signal at +1 608-446-2243.\r\nShare With Someone\r\nLink to share easily: bit.ly/dategina \r\n________________\r\n[1] Also, what I want may change! I could meet someone great who has in mind a different type of relationship, and I might be open to exploring that with them. I’ve learned from past partners and my own experience that people often don’t know exactly what they want.\r\n[2] With the exception of cat food, until I can buy cell-cultured meat for her."

Have some kinks, and like exploring, but not a kink-essentialist. I am actively into / not-threatened-by intelligence and competence in partners. If I have a “type”, it’s probably slightly androgynous women.\r\n\tBasic personality / identity facts\r\n\tNon-dogmatic, open, kind, problem-solving-oriented and ~75th percentile neurotic. I think humanity is massively underprepared for AI, and am working on that.\r\n\tLinks\r\n\thttps://www.benwr.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/benwr\r\nhttps://superstimul.us/profile/ben \r\nhttps://forms.gle/kVk74rqzfMh4Q2SM6 (use ^this form^ to contact me if you don’t want to use facebook or twitter)\r\n\tAll other details (sex stuff, test scores, personality typing systems)\r\n\tAvailable on request (seriously; especially wrt sex stuff, I’m happy to share, just not in this doc)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nRight now, I’m fairly happy with my ~stereotypical bachelor-y life, but am feeling pretty ready to settle down if I can find the right person. I live in a rationalist group house with a bunch of cool people. I have two current partners; eventually, I hope to find myself in an extremely trusting / loving / comfortable romantic relationship, but I’m not in a huge hurry. My imagination paints this relationship as monogamous, but I’m not fundamentally opposed to polyamory in the long run (and in the short run I probably don’t want to jump straight into a monogamous partnership). I’d like to have kids, potentially soon if I meet the right person!\r\nSome personality traits are very important to me in a partner: compassion, open-mindedness, and general wholesomeness are almost prerequisites for me to want to date someone. It’s a huge bonus if you also want to talk about random intellectual bullshit.\r\nAbout me\r\nI often actively seek honest feedback from people, so I have a pretty good selection that you can peruse if you want. See Appendices A and B. My basic augmented summary:\r\n* I like making things, and I’m good at it\r\n* I’m like 99th+ percentile principled, kind, thoughtful, and sincere\r\n* I apologize too much, and focus too much on not-imposing on others, rather than on e.g. doing fun things. Relatedly, I am kind of persnickety, especially about where I spend social effort.\r\n* I’m a good teacher, and love nerding out about things. Sometimes I can go a bit overboard.\r\nI’d also add:\r\n* Since early 2022, when I was hospitalized for an infection, my health has been vaguely (but very annoyingly) bad. I’ve gained a lot of weight, had serious problems with my digestion, and have been tired all the time.\r\n   * Around the same time, I was diagnosed with depression (possibly related to the fatigue).\r\n   * This has been sporadically improving since about June 2023. I seem to have much more energy, and my digestive issues are now intermittent rather than constant.\r\n* I am very into good coffee shops.\r\nI currently don’t do illegal drugs, but not because I’m opposed to them; I hope to resume very occasionally using psychedelics in about two years. See Appendix C for details about this.\r\nCareer-wise, I’m focused on trying to ensure that humanity survives at least a few more decades. My background is in computer science and engineering, and I worked on self-driving cars and lab automation for genomics, before switching to trying to address risks to humanity from artificial intelligence, starting in 2017. Since then I’ve done lots of things; some AI-related and some aimed at biological risks. Right now I’m working at Palisade Research, on demonstrations of AI failures, and also as acting director of AI Impacts.\r\nSome random bragging\r\nI’m really good at writing code. I used to do it competitively in college. I also designed and wrote big chunks of the software that's running the Cruise self driving cars.\r\nIn 2020 I solved an open problem in distributed systems (related to how one would write a piece of software like Roam or Workflowy as a \"conflict-free replicated datatype\"). I haven't published it because writing up the proof would be more trouble than it's worth, but I did get confirmation from the leading guy in the subfield that my solution works.\r\nIn May 2023, in a fit of frustration, I invented the “whiskey cleanse”, which seems to have successfully solved my year-long serious digestive issues, which my doctor had been unable to solve.\r\nI’m pretty good at sex. Of eight sex partners, two have said that I was their favorite partner to date (both from pools of 7-10), and others have also given very positive feedback. One kink (sorta) that I will mention, is that I really like being especially competent, and ensuring that my partner is having a great time. I definitely don’t want to promise that we’d have great sex, since I haven’t really subjected this to any selection pressure before, and the kind of people who date me are, by definition, the kind of people who date weird nerds (who might in turn be unusually bad at sex). But I think my track record is pretty good, at least.\r\nAppendix A: Anonymous feedback\r\nSome anonymous feedback I’ve received in the last few years, via this feedback form:\r\n* I appreciate the sense of togetherness I feel when around you. It's like you're holding a certain kind of space for the world to just be as it is, and not to have to act according to a social script or put up a facade.On the flip side, I think you apologize too much. There are ways an apology can serve as a kind of shield that hides the acknowledgement of what happened. When you apologize I often feel most alone around you, like you've retreated into your shell.I'm glad you are who you are.\r\n* I think you underestimate how much people like you and how much they value your company.\r\n* Ben WR#... Engineering Type PokémonBens can be found in the area surrounding the San Francisco Bay.Strengths: * I really admire your dedication to your principles. You are dedicated even by the standard of effective altruists, which is impressive. There are ways in which you could be more dedicated, but this is still one of my favorite things about you. * I like the way you go about thinking about \"engineering\" type problems. You aren't afraid of the complexity the way I sometimes am, and are are even curious about it. * You are great at being a socratic duck.Weaknesses: * It seems like you've developed some scars after a rough time getting up to speed at MIRI. Adding more speculation to the already speculative armchair psychoanalysis, these scars hold you back from diving into to your work to the extent you did at Cruise. It's plausible that now's a good time to renew your attempts to resolve these scars.\r\n* great guy.\r\n* You are often an effective teacher with a good amount of patience.\r\nAppendix B: Anonymized feedback from people who know me especially well\r\nI ran a birthday “dooms & destinies” conversation on chathamroom.com (a web site I made) for my 31st birthday, in late November 2022. I invited the 15 people who know me best (apart from my family), including 2 ex-partners and 1 current partner, to contribute any thoughts or advice they had for me (without revealing which of the 15 said what). Here are most of the things they said (leaving out some that don’t make sense without more context):\r\n* You are easy for me to feel warmly toward, and to care about, and to expect care from, and to expect to have be able to care about other people. I think this is really great. It seems kinda rare among my friends, or among Berkeley people.\r\n* You are an attentive and sincere and intelligent conversation partner, and talking to you is in a nice way like talking to myself, more than for most people. It's probably important that you are reasonable and I trust your judgment a lot. And also that I think you rarely misunderstand me. It feels like we can talk with a lot of precision.\r\n* You don't work with imperfection well. It seems like you need to fix imperfections that somehow shouldn't bother you… [On the other hand,] You don't pretend that things are perfect when they're not. You don't accept things are good when they don't seem so to you. You believe in concrete paths forward to better things that you, personally, could start on today\r\n* You seem to want to trade or commensurate in an unusual way when it comes to human relationships. Like, \"I don't want to do X when talking to people. But it seems like I should be able to do Y instead [in conversation or elsewhere in life] and still get Z??\". I don't know if this possible, but it seems like it's not working for most Z\r\n* You are kind. It seems like your kindness goes first to the rejected and ashamed. You are not a fair-weather friend.\r\n   * +1. I also appreciate this about you.\r\n   * Yes, I would never worry that Ben would not want to hang out with me/care for me because I 'became less cool' or was depressed or something, he feels very dependable and loyal.\r\n*  you are good at making things! This is great.\r\n   * Relatedly, you are good at imagining the world in ways that it is not, and thinking them through, and good to talk to re this.\r\n* you have a kind of trust in your own ability to do things that I admire, and that I wish more people had. This is probably related to the person who said \"you are good at making things!\". In me it sits as a kind of self-trust, and I admire it and see it as a source of strength and grounding.\r\n   * +1 because I think this actually rubbed off on me some when we were working on something together and it's been a net positive in other parts of my life.\r\n   *   Yes I like this a lot about Ben. And in particular I think you do this in a way that doesn't make other people feel inferior/inadequate, you're being competent very much for yourself rather than performatively\r\n   *   I also find it both adorable and inspirational how much you are excited and nerdy about making and solving and building things\r\n* I think you tend to over-identify with things? With certain groups of people and identities but also with specific behaviors and struggles in a way that can be self-fulfillling\r\n* You decline a lot of invitations, but ask that you still be invited to the next thing, because you are actually interested but something is going on. This only works for so long. Ive seen people stop inviting you despite the requests because it gets old. As a destiny, which you do actually show up, you are a lot of fun to be around.\r\n   * my sense is that you get a lot out of being with other people (i.e. are not fundamentally a loner type person, at least in ways) but are often relatively alone because specific opportunities are bad in ways. But you then don't often cause social things yourself that would be good. My guess is that doing so is costly and not immediately worth it, but I wonder if it would lead to a better overall part of the landscape if you got an affordance for it.\r\n* I think Ben is very broadly likable. I don't recall hearing of a person saying they have negative sentiment toward him in general, and people often seem to have positive sentiment.\r\n   *   Yes, I think Ben is broadly regarded as a sweetheart and very nice to have around\r\n* I appreciate how much integrity you have\r\n* You're very generous with your time and efforts - I really appreciate times you've e.g. helped drive me to places, helped me solve technical problems, etc\r\n* You have too many preferences and/or pay too much attention to small preferences; on the margin, I think you should prioritize 'being ok with a wider range of things; learning to ignore annoyances or appreciate different kinds of things' over 'changing things to suit your preferences'. I can try to think of examples if that's unclear as it is.\r\n* You are a great teacher. I think this is a related to other destinies of groundedness about your competence, intrinsic interest in doing things, patience and gentleness and attentiveness with other people. You are very good at explaining things, sharing interest and excitement about them, not making the recipient feel dumb for not knowing stuff already, making it feel easy to ask questions, providing positive reinforcement for sharing confusion and questions, making people feel like a good student. It seems like you also enjoy teaching. I think this is an asset in life in general even if you don't make it an explicit part of your career, but I think you could consider trying to take advantage of this even more.\r\n* You score the highest of almost anyone I know on some kind of social attentiveness to imposition/inconvenience/asking things of people. This makes you very considerate and sweet, but I think it can also cause unnecessary suffering for you and others. I do think the underlying trait is definitely an asset, but you can probably shape it into something that involves less negative affect… almost all of your apologizing is for things where there isn't anything in particular I would have wanted you to do differently). I don't think this is hugely important - I see this overall thing as an endearing trait that's part of what makes you such a sweetheart, but seems like it causes you a bit more pain than is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix C: Why I temporarily don’t do drugs\r\nI want life insurance, in order to sign up for cryonics. I refused to lie on the application, despite my insurance agent’s preference that I do so. I learned that if you’ve done any illegal drugs other than marijuana in the last five years, and are stupid/stubborn enough to tell them so on the application, they just will not insure you no matter what. So I’m now about three years through a five-year drug-free period.\r\nI’ve written a bit about my approach to honesty, which results in my unwillingness to lie to the insurance company."

Email me at johnrwoolley0@gmail.com\r\nGeneral Me stuff\r\nI’m a textbook nerd in a lot of ways: I like sci-fi, video games and programming, and I sometimes get fixated on niche topics like the history of earth’s climate or Sumerian civilisation. I am always excited by the complexity of the world, and driven to understand whatever I can of it. I love the rush that comes from figuring out something complicated. If you’re into something I’ll enjoy learning about it from you!\r\nI get a lot out of creating things. It scratches a deep itch in my soul to make a piece of software, a story, a work presentation, or even a Minecraft build.\r\nI am quite independent-minded and happy spending time by myself (only child thing?). I’m a ‘small group of close friends’ person. I sometimes have to persuade myself to go and meet new people, but I generally enjoy it when I do, and I’m able to find something in common with whoever I meet.\r\nIn 2022 I signed the Giving What We Can pledge to give 10% of my income to charity over my lifetime, and I get a lot of satisfaction and well-being from helping to solve the world’s problems in whatever small way I can. I’ve been meditating daily for a few years and it’s been hugely influential on my life/ethical philosophy, as well as helping with my tendency to overthink and get anxious.      \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nShorter points\r\n* I’m 31 and I live in Manchester, UK. My degree was in mathematics and physics.\r\n* I’m a software engineer. I’m currently on a machine learning project (I promise to shut up about it if that bores you!).\r\n* I like reading books of all kinds (I read slowly but I get there!). I’ve also written two (bad) sci-fi novels and I’m trying to finish my third.\r\n* I exercise most days, though I’m not a particularly sporty or outdoorsy person.\r\n* I used to play electronic keyboard a lot, I occasionally still do.\r\n* I’m generally organised and tidy, with both physical possessions and general life admin.\r\n* I almost never do alcohol/drugs (except caffeine; I drink unreasonable amounts of tea).\r\n* I’m open to either a mono or poly relationship.\r\n* I haven’t thought a lot about having children but I believe I could be happy with or without them.\r\nYou\r\nI’m looking for someone to have a long-term relationship with, maybe marriage, kids etc. I don’t have a lot of dating experience, so I am generally open-minded about the whole thing. That said, I am attracted to femininity in its many forms (sorry gents, I’m straight as they come). If you’re aged 25-35, and living (at least partly!) in the UK, let’s chat!\r\nBonus points if you live near to Manchester, have an intellectual curiosity, and would be up to playing video or board games together.\r\nTrivia\r\n* My best ever reddit post is a cool fact I learned about prehistoric humans. Other highlights include one of my minecraft builds and this thread I started just before Russia invaded Ukraine.\r\n* I’m a bit of a picky eater (I lived off huel for a while) but I do occasionally like making shortbread or cheesecake to share with people.\r\n* I’ve been collecting houseplants recently. Three and a half out of four are still alive, which I consider a great success!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me at: johnrwoolley0@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿I’m Jacob ‘Jisk’ Kopczynski, one of many programmers in Oakland\r\nMy Face\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI don’t like photographs much, so this sampling spreads across several years. The top-left is the most recent, at LessOnline. My hair gets rave reviews for reasons I don’t fully understand.\r\nBasics\r\nKids: No        Hookups: No             Monogamy: No        Relationship Anarchy: No\r\nAge: 33, mostly uninterested in dating below 25.\r\nOrientation: Straight, to a first approximation         Kink: An obligate dom, as far as I know\r\nContact info: ja.kopczynski ~at~ gmail .dot. com, Discord @_jisk\r\nRelationship Goals\r\nI’m not currently seeking a specific thing. I would appreciate having a primary relationship. I would appreciate having a couple more secondary relationships. (Maybe even both of those.) I would appreciate a quasi-primary long-distance relationship where we spend a few weeks a year in the same place and are effectively primaries then and secondaries the other months. In general terms, I’m a little under-saturated in close relationships and would like to fix that.\r\nValues\r\nEpistemic Rationality - I’m a pretty committed epistemic rationalist. Believe true things, even if they aren’t useful; say true things, even if they aren’t comfortable. I don’t pick fights about this much anymore, but it’s there and it’s not going away. I’m particularly harsh about self-deception. Beware telling yourself lies, because you’ll forget they’re lies.\r\nEffective Altruism - I’m an EA in the sense that I signed the Giving What We Can pledge and roughly agree with the EA movement about what charities count as effective. I’m not an EA in the sense that I don’t try to maximize the good done - I delegate all the optimization to the big foundations and don’t worry about it.\r\nAI Singularity - I don’t expect my retirement fund to be worth the bits it’s printed on. I mean, I have one, but still. We get doom or utopia; there’s no middle ground. This doesn’t come up much day-to-day, but it’s there.\r\nHobbies\r\nGames! - I have a floor-to-ceiling cabinet of board games and don’t play nearly enough. I have a list. Twilight Imperium is on the shelf twice, but I also love much lighter games like Tokaido, Tsuro, and King of Tokyo. I also enjoy many video games, D&D and derivatives (I prefer 3.5/Pathfinder), and making my own tabletop games.\r\nWorldbuilding - Whether it’s creating my own D&D setting to run campaigns in or taking a video game or CYOA prompt and running with it to flesh out the world around it and write stories in it, I really like worldbuilding. It’s much more fun with an audience, and collaboration has been fun.\r\nWriting - It’s fun! And, surprisingly, uses very different creative muscles from programming, despite still being sitting at a screen hitting a keyboard. I have written a fair amount of glowfic, and a lesser quantity of standard-variety fanfic. I also have some porn but I’m not willing to link that to my name in a publicly-readable document. \r\nMeetup Hosting - I host a LessWrong meetup in my (big) living room every week, rotating through topics. It’s meant to be a place where new members of the community can meet established ones, and a generally structured social hangout for our many awkward nerds. Want to meet me without going on a date? Ask, or take a look on Discord here.\r\nFire Arts - I don’t do this nearly often enough, and don’t have any pictures, but I do fire spinning. My preferred prop is a pair of clubs, and I can do most things poi can do with them. I strongly recommend it - it’s a good workout, and also everyone looks hot with fire in their hands.\r\nRitual Design - I don’t do this as much recently, since I no longer think there will be enough generations of the rationalist community to need ritual to stay value-aligned, but I’m interested in the cautious, well-considered use of ritual. And the misuse of it. It’s powerful but dangerous.\r\nHates\r\nWoo/Spirituality - It’s like religion but without the social benefits that made it worthwhile for most people for centuries.\r\nCircling/Authentic Relating/Nonviolent Communication - This is toxic coercive bullshit in sheep’s clothing and I do not trust it within 500 feet of my brain. It’s like someone decided the problem with social status was that it wasn’t pervasive enough and was too easy to see coming.\r\nAnticapitalists - I cannot stand people who blame the world’s problems on ‘capitalism’, talk about ‘late-stage capitalism’ (there’s no such thing and that’s quite obvious) or ‘degrowth’ (probably the most evil economic philosophy extant), shit on Amazon, or generally ignore the way that capitalism has pulled the world out of poverty in a way nothing else came close to addressing. It’s a berserk button.\r\nDate Ideas\r\nI’ve enjoyed\r\n* cuddling and reading stories aloud\r\n* watching shows together and riffing/heckling\r\n* wandering the streets and talking\r\n* playing games together - competitive or cooperative, board or video, puzzles, whatever\r\nAnd expect I’d enjoy\r\n* going somewhere tall and enjoying the view\r\n* beta reading each other's porn\r\n* learning to dance together\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix: Detailed Explanations\r\nKids\r\nI do not want kids for myself. This wouldn’t necessarily be prohibitive if my partner really wanted them, but IME I only like about half of kids, even the kids of parents I like. This seems prohibitive. Does not rule out me dating someone with existing kids if they’re not planning to get more, if I get along with the existing kids, but it’s basically prohibitive on the ‘having more’ front.\r\nMonogamy/Polyamory\r\nI’m in a long-duration secondary relationship I don’t want to break.\r\nI practice hierarchical polyamory.\r\nMany sources such as More Than Two will tell you this is a red flag, but this is incorrect. Hierarchical relationships set an absolute minimum amount of communication about the health and status of the relationship.\r\nAlso, considering the record of drama in the relationships of the authors of MTT, which produced multiple accusations of abuse, does not inspire confidence that their relationship advice is good. Also, all dramabombs I have been witness to in poly circles derived from refusal to label relationships or violation of the clear boundaries of hierarchical relationships. I consider this evidence that hierarchical poly is in fact a green flag; relationship anarchy and other nonhierarchical styles are the red flags.\r\nEffective Altruism\r\nI’m not out to do the most good I can. I’m out to be a good person by my own lights, according to a non-deceptive and particularly non-self-deceptive definition of good person. I thought about it for a while, decided EA was probably right, joined a meatspace community with a lot of EAs, still thought it seemed right, and took the GWWC pledge as a concrete commitment when I had a job and could clearly afford it. My last annual donations were an ad-hoc mix of GiveDirectly, GiveWell, the EA Funds Long-Term Future Fund, and MIRI. Past years have also included CFAR but they lost my trust due to woo and Circling.\r\nStraight*\r\nI’ve dated transmasculine people but I lost interest as they got more masculine. I have not recently noticed any interest in anyone but cis women. Sorry.\r\nKink\r\nWhen I say ‘as far as I know’, I mostly mean ‘last I checked’, which was… like four years ago for most purposes. I spent a couple years asexual due to medical side effects (worth it), and that only faded this year.\r\nHistorically, I’ve been interested in mild sadism, hypnokink, low-grade forced exhibitionism, and improvised bondage. I like rope bondage in theory, but getting real practice in is difficult without an accessible ‘demo sub’ so I suck at it. I like the idea of ‘feral’-ish fights for control, but it may turn out I hate that if I lose."

      "fullText": "﻿Julia’s date-me  \r\ntl;dr \r\nHI! I’m Julia. I made this doc because I’m looking for a fun and joyful partnership filled with travel, adventures big and small, deep conversations, and community. I want to build a (monogamous) relationship filled with intention. I want to be a team, be each other’s sounding board about ideas that thrill us, be a source of comfort on hard days, and to laugh (a lot!) together. (Friends often comment on how much I laugh.)\r\nWe’ll hike in the redwoods, lose our voices at a 90’s sing-along with friends, and go on a quest to find the best ice cream in Sonoma. juliaheartsthebay@gmail.com \r\nSome basics\r\nAge: 40 (looking for someone in their mid-30s to mid-40s)\r\nGender: Female                Location: Oakland                Sexuality: I identify as straight                Monogamy?: Yes, please! \r\nHeight: I’m tall! (5’9”) and usually date people 5’8-6’2” but open outside that range!\r\nWants kids: 90% no (climate change), but I love kids and have lots of kids in my life and am OK if you have kids already.\r\nThe 10% is open to it with the right person and circumstances.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you Not everything below is necessary, but if some resonate we’re likely compatible! \r\n\r\n\r\nYou feel a responsibility to help others or make the world a better place, and likely do that through your work. This could mean you’re a teacher, a policy wonk, a nonprofit worker, a doctor, or a therapist. It’s unlikely that you’re an engineer working in big tech or selling things. This is a central part of how you operate in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou are self-aware and are comfortable talking about your feelings and communicating generally. You have really deep friendships (even if it’s a small number) and connections, and you are looking to build a relationship with someone and are excited about the collaboration that takes. You may have been through therapy or in other ways have worked on yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou enjoy physical affection. You like to snuggle on the couch and give each other shoulder rubs. This isn’t a lot of PDA when we’re with friends and it’s OK if you need alone time.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are active and think about health. You like to get outside and move in some way or play a sport for fun. You might also like to indulge sometimes, but it doesn’t look like ordering in Domino’s every week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have your own life and you go after happiness. You know what makes you happy and you’ve built that into your life. You have a strong sense of agency and in moments that you’ve been unhappy (in a toxic job, etc), you’ve changed it. You have a strong sense of gratitude for the things that do bring you joy.\r\nAbout me\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI feel a strong moral obligation to help other people. I visited a number of developing countries when I was young and it really shaped me, especially my understanding of wealth and privilege. I have worked in politics, at environmental organizations, with sustainable farmers, in journalism, and in progressive advocacy organizations. It’s a central theme in my professional life and a big part of my identity. I work for a startup that builds nonprofit fundraising technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have good work-life balance and boundaries… and I love having fun! I don’t work crazy hours, have a very active social life, and spend time on hobbies. I love game nights, fun ways to connect with community, and opportunities to live life to its fullest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends are very important to me. I’m often central to organizing social things in my groups of friends, whether it’s bringing a friend who is having a tough week a meal or organizing a 2 week remote working house in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m active - I play pickleball several times per week, hike, walk with friends, and swim. I like to be outside and in the trees. I had some serious injuries in the last few years (broke my ankle, injured my spine) and recovering from them made me very grateful for the ability to be active and pain-free, but also put a high priority on health and being strong.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI like adventures. I get excited about a lot of things - whether it’s a road trip to Montana, hiking the W in Patagonia with 10 friends, or checking out new breweries in the Bay Area. I have worked remotely for 6 years and often visit friends or family or beautiful places - I love to life hack to make the most of things. I spent a year of the pandemic living for a month in different places with 10 friends – we got to explore, cook dinner together, have funny competitions, and play games. \r\n\r\n\r\nI love food - hosting dinner parties, going to fun restaurants, and sharing food. I’m a planner, and would welcome a partner who is also a planner, or who complements that with spontaneity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things that might be notable: \r\n* I’m very positive and feel a lot of agency to find happiness. This doesn’t mean life is always easy or that I don’t get down, but I actively work to change things when I’m unhappy or something is missing in my life (hence this document?).\r\n* I’m a clear communicator and am comfortable being vulnerable. There’s basically no such thing as ‘oversharing’ with me. \r\n* I’m an Enneagram 2 (Helper, don’t care whether you know what this means!)\r\n* My top strength in Strengthsfinder is responsibility (also don’t care if you know what this means!), which manifest in my being caring and generous and often taking on labor when I see a need or opportunity. \r\n* I often process things out loud, and I’m an open book. \r\n* I pride myself on my independence, but the last few years have honed my ability to ask for help.\r\n* I’m someone who sees the silver lining in most situations.\r\nAbout “us”\r\nMy vision for a relationship … \r\n* I have a pretty strong belief that relationships don’t just happen and aren’t just about finding the right match, they take active work. The relationships I most admire in friends have often included couples counseling and working through tough periods in a way that resulted in being closer and stronger as a couple. I like having regular relationship check-ins, talking through what is and isn’t working for each of us, and brainstorming how we can better support each other.\r\n* I care deeply about respecting my partner and what they do and how they exist in the world, and want that in return.\r\n* My top love languages are physical touch and acts of service. My best relationships have included mutually taking care of each other and wanting to do things to make the other happy. One ex and I did fun “surprise trips” for each other regularly. \r\n* Sharing labor is very important to me – this can look a lot of ways, but it hasn’t worked for me in relationships when I feel like I’m doing a lot more of the relationship work (bringing up hard conversations) or the actual work (household work, planning, etc). As a result, it has meant a lot to me when a partner takes things on that I haven’t thought about yet or I didn’t ask them to do. Just because I can do it all on my own doesn’t mean I want to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next?\r\nHow to reach out: email juliaheartsthebay@gmail.com. I like directness - feel free to dive in to explore potential dealbreakers or suggest a date. \r\n\r\n\r\n(Some people wanted more info… if you want more, this is for you!)\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaning into the “there’s no such thing as oversharing,” here are some reflections on past relationships:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did some of my last relationships not work out? \r\n* We didn’t want the same lifestyle (he wanted #vanlife)\r\n* We didn’t want to live in the same place (I wanted to be in California)\r\n* Our politics (and underlying values) were too different \r\n* We had different approaches to relationships – they felt like it should just work or not work, and I wanted to be on an ongoing journey together to make it work\r\n* We had different communication styles and preferences – I would rather talk and hear about what’s not working so we can solve it together and understand each other better, but they found that to be stressful\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat might be things my exes say about me? \r\n\r\n\r\nSome good stuff: \r\n* I’m very caring and thoughtful and generous\r\n* I laugh a lot and love to have fun and I feel excitement and awe at small and big things alike\r\n* I bring up the hard things and am willing to do the work, whether it’s together or work I need to do on my end\r\n* I have great friends!! \r\n* I am great at logistics and making things happen\r\n\r\n\r\nSome bad stuff: \r\n* I have a full life and time with friends is a priority (for an ex who wanted to spend most nights together, this was tough)\r\n* It’s hard for me to feel deeply connected to people who don’t care about and prioritize making the world better; people I’ve dated who were, say, a data scientist at an e-commerce company, found this to be really dogmatic. \r\n* I’m not hesitant to bring up things that aren’t working for me; especially when I’ve dated people who don’t feel as comfortable doing this, what I have brought up weighed on them or it felt like to them that I couldn’t be happy in the relationship.\r\n* I’m better at giving than receiving - in my best relationships we’ve both given a lot and enjoyed that, but I’ve also had relationships where they’ve felt like it’s a burden. One ex said “can’t you just do fewer things for me, so I don’t feel like I have to do things for you?” BUT I also am working on being better at asking for help and receiving it. \r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for someone who read all of this and is curious, felt that some of this resonated with them, has questions… reach out! Looking forward to connecting with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by other friends’ profiles… thank you. Also, if you want to date a different Bay Area pickleball fanatic who cares about making the world a better place, check out Taren's date-me page as well! She’s a great friend and an inspiring changemaker, and I want her to find her person too!"

I’ve done enough work on myself as a person that I’m looking for someone that can help me grow and I can help grow as well. Big believer in chemistry; it either works or it doesn’t work. That being said, I’m a slow-burn and an acquired taste.\r\nHere are some things that drive chemistry for me:\r\n* Genuine interest in life and learning more (no one-word answers or feigning disinterest to seem cool)\r\n* Emotional intelligence. Being able to communicate your thoughts and identify your strengths/shortcomings is hot.\r\n* Similar life views and interests, but different enough that we’re not the same person. Hard to quantify or summarize, but we’ll both know.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Enneagram\r\n\tType 8\r\n\tMyers Briggs\r\n\tINTP\r\n\tQuick need to knows\r\n* Male, straight, monogamous.\r\n* 5’9, ~160ish lbs and fairly athletic. Frequent runner/biker.\r\n* Very Liberal policy-wise, but have my limits. \r\n* Raised non-denominational christian, personally non-religious\r\n* Drink 3-5 times a month, generally only there’s an impetus (party, nice dinner,  happy hour, etc.)\r\n* Occasional weed usage. Never have tried anything harder, but could be talked into experimentation.\r\n* Private Banker. I work with HNW/UHNW persons on their unique banking needs, outside of what you’d be able to get from an app or a bank branch. Lots of VC/Tech adjacent people.\r\n* MA in Financial Economics from University of St Andrews (Scotland). Also a CFA Charterholder.\r\n* Kids? I’m mostly on the “no” boat but who knows who or what might change me.\r\nLife Story (the first date drivel)\r\n1. Born and raised in the Chicago Suburbs. Winnetka, if you need to know. If i had to give myself a typecast it would be “the uncool kid that hung out with the cool kids because they all thought he was genuinely fun”\r\n2. I went to University of St Andrews in Scotland. I studied economics, was a rower (and coach), and generally had a great time being slightly immature but also trying to be sophisticated.\r\n3. I came back to Chicago after graduating, and sold my soul to a bank. I dove in way too deep and became way too much of a recluse while COVID raged. \r\n4. I needed a change and used my bargaining power to find myself a role out in San Francisco. I moved out at the end of 2021 and have been trying to find myself again.\r\nI have two great parents (both work in finance too, I know we suck), an older brother who is outshining me by having a fiance + a dog + a house in Chicago, and always grew up with Golden Retrievers and Corgis (cool ones).\r\nMy Flaunts\r\n1. Not a ‘dude’\r\n   1. I do yoga occasionally\r\n   2. Love candles\r\n   3. Great at giving opinions on women’s outfits\r\n2. Wide range of skills and knowledge\r\nDrives manual, knowledge of historical events, wide ranging vocabulary, pretty impressive cardio ability.\r\n3. Intellectual prowess\r\n1. 33 ACT (top 1%)\r\n2. Passed CFA program without any re-takes\r\n3. Went to the #1 university in the UK and got a 2:1 degree\r\n4. I’m hilarious both sober and drunk if you get on my level of goofiness\r\n5. Maturity\r\n   1. Emotional Intelligence\r\n   2. Great conversationalist with middle aged people\r\n   3. Able to rationalize my own and other’s actions\r\n6. Passionate and generous lover\r\nMy secret is eye contact and lots of skin contact. Also, it’s good size and it’s got a curve ;)\r\nMy Faults\r\n7. I’m an emotional work in progress\r\nYeah, I have a therapist (shoutout to Linda). At least I admit it!\r\n8. Trouble keeping my thoughts and opinions to myself\r\nMy boss and coworkers love this trait.\r\n9. I can be a cheapskate\r\nTime to confess I have some socks with holes and buy the cheap paper towels (but not toilet paper. I always have good toilet paper).\r\n10. Trouble admitting when I need help\r\nAgain, shoutout to Linda\r\n11. I need to treat myself better\r\n   1. Skincare routine needs work\r\n   2. Don’t get all my fruits/vegetables everyday\r\n   3. I occasionally wear socks with holes in them\r\n12. I’m a stereotype on paper\r\nWorks in finance, lives in the marina, drives a BMW. I make up for this in other ways (see flaunts).\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________"

Also, wanna try lots of things in my life: https://www.svitlana.me/curiosities.\nSpirituality & interest in the eastern religions/philosophy\nI have been wondering about spiritual-like topics for 3 years now. Some questions are: what is reality? who am I and what is self?\nThe real hunger for spiritual understanding accelerated when russia invaded my home. Check then news on Ukraine. To help myself cope, I have been reading a lot. I think I found some sense equanimity and peace  now that is  becoming more and more present. I meditate, do yoga, breath work, cold plunges on a regular basis.\nMovement\nAt first a coping mechanism, movement now grew into me. I need it and do it often. Not necessarily restricting moving to gym, a square of grass or yoga mat is great too. My goals are handstands, crow pose, pull-ups and flexibility/mobility.\nSeems like I vibe with calisthenics but excited to also try dancing. I regret not doing sports in my adolescence as now there is so much work to be done to get to what I want (e.g. I want handstands and it is hard on both physical and inner-work levels). Persistence and consistency are my best friends here. On a weekly basis I do some movement 5-6x a week (this includes  yoga which many people consider an exercise).\nKindness and love\nKind by nature from my mom and appreciate kindness in others.\nLove — influenced by hippies in sf. But hey love is cool and the world would be a better place if we embraced it.\nSelf-awareness gamey game\nI got to have very random experiences during my life, e.g. living in a dozen of cities around the world and hitchhiking a bunch when I was a naive teenager. I switched “homes” many times and my 5 closest friends are from 5 different countries. As such, I had to learn how to think a lot and choose the best of two/x worlds.\nMy career game\ninvolves me now being a PM at Google’s Labs. thinking a lot and figuring.\ni love my friends so so much\nALT\nThings I like\nBooks: check out my 📚\nbooks and medias. db. recents favs: thich nhat han, creative way, metaphors we live by, consolations, little life, krishnamurti\nReads: check out my https://curius.app/svitlana-midianko2 .\nAlso: breath work, meditation, Sam Harris work, yoga, running, traveling, camping, Bali,  NATURE, cinnamon buns, conversations with strangers, sunsets/rises, mindmaps, books, climbing trees and reading, product management, big history, psychedelics, women’s history, evolution, dogs, temperature play (cold plunges!), dancing, Alan Watts, cross-generational friendships, ecstatic dance\nLife things and mind drills\nWork in progress\nI have soooooo many areas of improvement I am working on. Have tips on how to improve here?\nLetting go of high standards towards myself and other beings\nFiguring out what to do in life\nWhile humbly appreciating things I have been privileged to have.\nIndecisiveness\nIt’s hard to make decisions for me! Contributors: (a) do not know how to listen to my intuition; (b) WIP prioritization skills; (c) I overall just find good things in many things.\nThinking for myself as a muscle\nLetting go of external pressures\nAnd also, building comfort in asking for help\nInsecurities.\nA lot of more on  my substack!\nmy fav weekly routine: handstands class at circus → GGP bike ride + convo w strangers/dogs\nALT\nWhat my friends say: borshch\nIt is hard to have an objective evaluation of a human being, so I found borshch to be the closest proxy for estimating quality of me as future wife.\nBorshch is a Ukrainian soup that takes ~2-3 hours to make and is often cooked as a test for marriage readiness. A wife (yes wife, not a man bc men do not cook!!!) is only as good as her borshch (ah, what a great way to reduce human complexity:).\nMy friend said, “the caliber of a person is determined not by any single borscht they cooked, but that they keep cooking borscht. It is the borscht of the soul that makes the borscht of the stomach.”\nI fed my friends with borshch and asked some follow-up qs.\nbeware that my subjects are coming with personal bias. One friend even ate meat soup  as vegetarian??!?\nALT\nHow likely are you to recommend this borshch to your friend?\nUse three words to describe how this borshch made you feel\nHow often would you eat this borshch?\nThe caliber of a person is determined not by any single borscht they cooked, but that they keep cooking borscht. It is the borscht of the soul that makes the borscht of the stomach.\nThe soup indicates Svitlana is very ready for marriage!! 🤪\nSvitlana is a curious soul who will happily lay under the trees for hours. You will find her doing handstands at beaches (or any other flat surface you can think of), wearing flowers as a hat, or striking conversations with strangers. Ask her about psychedelics and she will give you many good resources.\nShe loves purple, blueberries, and building elaborate Notion pages. Overall, I would describe her as a kind, self-aware, curious, and emotionally mature human being. 20/10. Highly recommend!\nThe Borshch was kind, compassionate, and created a loving environment and home. 10/10, would eat again\nboo\nMisc & bullets\nPodcast in which I talk about my adolescence\nI started Substack!\nI hitchhiked over 10k km when I was 17. It taught me lots of kindness and active listening.\nI was lucky to have lived in seven countries (~12 cities) which helped me build empathy and appreciation for diverse viewpoints. Favorites: for living it is London and NYC; for spiritual growth, it is Bali and India.\nI am Ukrainian. Yes, the war is still happening (on an even larger scale than when the media had incentives to discuss it). Pls check the news and donate if you can.\nFAQ\nIf you have questions, comment here, ask me, or submit via this anonymous form.\n“But hey svitlana what are you looking for in a romantic partner?” - added in anon form in march\n“Hey svitlana, how about your preferences on poly vs mono and gender?” - added as per feedback of too many people\nThanks Alexander Scott for writing an article that explored this theme and sparked my curiosity enough to start this doc!\nLog\nSvitlana-ing\n12/25/2024\nor not\nSvitlana-ing\n02/26/2024\nkinda unsure if i still resonate as much..\nSvitlana-ing\n09/16/2024\nwith self = world, i think this still resonates.\nSvitlana-ing\n03/17/2024\ni sense my friends r tired of my external processing here tho"

      "fullText": "Skip to content\n🥰\nEDIT: As of Nov 2024 - this is now deprecated! 😍 I am now happily married 💍 (and yes, we did meet through our dateme docs 😜)\nGet Notion free\n🥰\nEDIT: As of Nov 2024 - this is now deprecated! 😍 I am now happily married 💍 (and yes, we did meet through our dateme docs 😜)\nDate Me! <3\n😍 Hi there! Welcome to my Date Me doc, which I must admit feels a bit charmingly low-tech in this Tinder age but hopefully in a cute we-bumped-each-into-each-other-at-the-online-coffeeshop kinda way. I'm Connie, a 33-year-old Chinese American techie person happily settled now in SF* after many years of wandering, Odysseus-style, through half the hokiest small towns in the US. I'm short, monogamous, and usually dressed in an alarmingly varied array of colors:\n(me, doing things)\n(me, still doing things)\n(me, doing something I will definitely never do again)\nI'd regale you with tales of my wanderings, but they're honestly quite boring and involve a lot of pet lab mice and early internet fanfic for some reason. The gist of it is that some combination of temperament, parental upbringing, and early Shounen Jump issues led to the dorky, egregiously friendly Huffleclaw you see before yourself today. In my bursts of social fancy I love flittering around novel/weird/interesting-sounding events, philosophy salons, and mysterious houseparties in the Bay, but I'm really an introvert at the core who likes to sun by big windows and nerd out on whatever topic has struck her this week (in my previous life I was definitely a cat, just one of those weirdo bodega ones that like people :P).\nI recharge my batteries on all the cozy things - longreads, podcasts, indie movies, coffeeshops and kava bars, bookshops with that old-book smell and perky plants, dinner parties, morning runs by the water and game nights with friends - but will absolutely get hype for the periodic rave, music festival, or good-lord-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into party. I'm high on the openness scale and enjoy poking at new things - even (especially) if they sound a bit out of my comfort zone - though my hope this year is to run around a little less, figure out the things I really care about, and go all in on the people and pursuits that matter to me. Who knows? That could be you 😉\nA few pluses about me:\nno kids, debt, or crazy exes\nlikes doing dishes and laundry because that's podcast time 👌\nprefers homey restaurants over fancy ones so cheap date\nspeaks Mandarin so kids will be set up for the future 💪\npretty good at charming old people so your parents will like me\nnot addicted to tiktok or insta 😃 (but addicted to reddit instead 😔)\ndecent meme game, if I do say so myself 😎\nMy current obsessions in this “just left the city I was in for a decade, hashtag yolo” phase of my life look something like training for a half-marathon, finally learning meditation (or similar in that vein), working on some AI side projects, researching for the book series I keep swearing I'll write, discovering more substacks to hoard in my email, spending a horrifying amount of time on soccer chats (long-suffering Spurs fan here… don't ask 🙈), and making my new home in SF. If I were to pick the one \"thing\" that really moves me, it'd be the idea of community and how we can better invigorate our society and the platforms we use to foster meaningful relationships, chances for connection, any form of antidote to loneliness that's a little less toxic than some of the tribes that have been forming online. I don't have good answers there but it's a subject I'm very interested in and would love to pick folks' brains on - so if you know anyone engaging in that sphere, I'd be all ears! 😊\nWhat I'm looking for\nA thoughtful, kind, kick-ass dude in either SF or NYC also looking for a life partner, a pet or two, and somewhere within one standard deviation of 2.5 kids (I was an only child and I think a sibling-less childhood just really sucks! I want to make a really fun household 😝).\nI'm super into a rigorous, analytical mind (though perhaps less in the sense of traditional booksmarts than street smarts, or a way of thinking outside the box) and curious, driven people who are always looking to learn and grow. I’ve matched well with honest, assertive, maybe even slightly disagreeable partners who aren't afraid to call me out on things and can balance me out as a teammate (I'll play good cop to your bad cop! The Agent J to your K. The Leslie to your Ron Swanson etc), but I also love goofballs who’ll text me a terrible meme at 4 in the morning. It’s stereotypical but oftentimes I think I’m just looking for someone who makes me laugh 😅 whose values also make me want to be a better person.\nI like sporty people. I like nerdy people. I like people who care; I think I'd take that over super “cool” people, as much as I am awed by their badassery sometimes. I love finding the life in people - passion is just delightful! (Even if it's mainly for fantasy football or large language models 😆). I can talk your ear off when I'm in the mood, but I LOVE people who can match my energy in conversation and even steer it or relieve my burden when I'm tired; and I think it's a great sign when we can do our own thing in companionable silence and enjoy that too.\nAbove all else though, I think personal integrity and, like, just giving a shit about people is sine qua non. How someone treats people, whether they keep their word, whether they can navigate the hard times with a steadiness of mind and character is so much more important imho than a few extra points on the IQ scale or zeros in the bank account. I feel the exact same way about close friends, which is why I call my dream life partner as \"basically a best friend I'm attracted to and want to raise a family with\" - some undefinable formula whose variables are a permutation of friendship, passion, and mutual respect.\nHonestly though, I could go on and on rambling here about a shared sense of humor, high bonding-ness, and a level of introversion that agrees to escape a party at the same time, but I do think most of this you're just never going to get off paper because it's really, like, all about the vibes, man. That's not to say dealbreakers don't exist or that compatibility is wholly unpredictable, but I really like waitbutwhy's take on it - a huge part of it is about who you really enjoy being around, and most of that time won't be romantic dates but grocery shopping and waiting for the bus and blobbing on the couch after work. You want someone you enjoy all the times in between the big vacations and dream travel destinations and Burning Mans with - someone you enjoy cooking dinner on the thousandth Wednesday with, or waiting for the Uber with, or rambling about your day to at the end of a long work week. Most of life is the mundane stuff in between the cool exciting stuff, so I'm looking for someone who I can have a mind-boggling amount of fun just Doordashing and watching Celebrity Family Feud with. That's rather difficult to figure out through a few paragraphs and a photo, so really, if this speaks out to you and we seem like a good match - hit me up and let's grab coffee?\nLifestyle compatibility\nIn a burst of abandon I once signed up for a matchmaking service (note: this did not land me on a Netflix reality show sadly, though it did get me a bunch of spam calls for a year after). The service did not work out as you can probably tell, but what I found interesting about it was that a solid 90% of the intake questions I had to answer was on my lifestyle. I'm not kidding - a quarter might have been about my sleeping habits alone (how late I slept, whether I was a light sleeper, if I needed space in the bed etc).\nThat has made me think a bit more about lifestyle fit. Having great dates with someone doesn't mean it's easy to live with them, and the latter gets much more important in a serious relationship. I'm sure plenty of folks might not put much stock in any of these, but just in case, I'll list some lifestyle traits of mine upfront:\nI'm more of a city gal than a super outdoorsy person, though I do run outdoors almost every day and enjoy a scenic hike or two (and I absolutely love parks!). My favored travel destinations lean towards cities and cultural/historical attractions more than extreme nature spots. Basically I'd pick reading in a cafe or visiting the Louvre over heavy-duty camping most of the time, though I’m absolutely down for festivals in the woods and cabin trips with  friends.\nLong-term I also want to stay around a major city, preferably SF or NYC since my social circles are here and my driving skills are uh, stereotypical at best 😅 Having said that, I definitely understand the space + cost trade-off of living in those cities.\nI'm not a huge gamer, though I've played a few RPGs and enjoy word-based boardgames and co-ops; and as you can tell from the Comic-Con pics, I’m a long-time anime/manga fan and geek out on a lot of things across the board (scifi, Doctor Who, Marvel etc).\nI drink socially, and it’d be nice if my partner could join me there though it’s not a big deal by any means. I'm not a huge foodie or picky but I do try to eat healthily (in moderation!) and am omnivorous with a plant-based lean. It doesn't matter to me if my partner's a serious foodie or vegan or has a lot of restrictions, though if their main hobby is food (e.g. eating out at fancy restaurants every other day) I wouldn’t be able to share in it.\nPolitically, I'm generally progressive, though eclectically so since I prefer to evaluate an issue in its own context instead of feeling boxed into one broad political platform. I'm open to partners on other parts of the spectrum, as long as there's still a values alignment.\nFinancially, I try to be pretty frugal on consumables (I don’t eat expensive meals or buy $400 purses) but will absolutely spend money on what I think of as investments: a high-end laptop, Lasik, a course I’m interested in, anything that makes me more productive at work. I care about experiences, especially the ones best done now (it’s hard to travel when old!) but I think tangible goods have their place in making your life better. Basically, my heuristic is to value the things that will buy me more time with friends. ❤️\nI’d like at least some time to myself most days; I think it's important for couples to have their own hobbies, though I do enjoy parallel play. I don't need my partner to go to everything with me - I can get into really social butterfly moods and if anything I'd much more appreciate having someone to come home to! Later on in a relationship, I'd love a little check-in text/call on days we're apart.\nSpeaking of - I do love texting 🙈 Not a huge deal to me if you don't, but some form of communication most days is pretty important to me. I'd be amped to have someone I can send both serious longreads and dumb twitter memes to, though I don't think there's a need to have a bunch of the same interests - it's more about a similar sense of humor and an interest in the other's life.\nMy love language is literally conversation, though I might file that more under quality time and companionship than words of affirmation. I love fussing over people and end up doing a lot of acts of service, and the Chinese heritage in me likes to say words are cheap, but my last relationship made me realize how much I value open affection. That's both physical and verbal - I can barely remember what I ate yesterday but almost never forget what someone says to me, for both good and bad (this is NOT to say I demand sappy love letters, just that a sincere word spoken in kindness goes a long way with me 😊).\nHit me up?\nFirst of all, you're the bomb if you actually read this far. And if this clicks with you and you think we might be a good match, hit me up via email, Facebook, or Twitter! If you have a similar kind of profile up somewhere that would be great, otherwise I'd appreciate an intro about yourself and what you're into, what you're looking for, pics or socials etc. Peace! 🖖\nConnie Li\n06/28/2023 (edited)\nAsterisk here is that I just moved here from NYC and still hope to visit NYC regularly! Essentially I’d like to go bicoastal, with SF as my homebase. I’m open to dating in either SF or NYC, with a leaning towards SF.\nConnie Li\n05/09/2023 (edited)\nI have learned from being around Bay Area circles I need to specify this 😆\nConnie Li\n08/08/2023\n5’1” checking in here 😛"

Hopefully if you know a boy i would like to touch with this will help you identify him.\r\nThings I want that most boys don’t have, roughly in order of how many boys they filter out and by how important/dealbreakery they are\r\n*open to kids maybe??? and probably doesn’t already have kids/strong life commitments\r\n*financially stable, bonus points for having more money than me\r\n*independent, not looking to spend all their time joined at hip\r\n*l i b e r t a r i a n  v i b e s\r\n*social power roughly within an order of magnitude of mine, tho doesn’t need to be same sphere\r\n*is open to risk, brave, caution is calculated, doesn’t let fear of bad outcomes affect taking life by the balls\r\n*sexually sinister\r\n*real good at [jazzhands] emotional maturity: stuff like detecting and naming emotions, having boundaries and a body, communication, “talking from the stomach”, circling skills, mind meldy moves, speaking-from-poetry-instead-of-accuracy\r\n*similar IQ range, which is higher than average but probably not as high as we’d hope\r\n*not boring? I am deeply, profoundly bored by most humans. Everyone is deeply ok as they are I just prefer to spend my time doing puzzles, which are more interesting than most humans. \r\n*accepting of self and others, at peace\r\n*good at (or at least compatible with/tolerant of) rationality n stuff, cold culture, happy to exchange money for social things, not easily horrified\r\nhow i’m poly\r\n(full-ass post here)\r\nPolyamory is very much mandatory for me, unless you’re a billionaire, because i am down to accept money in exchange for social things. For me, “poly” just means “I don’t place rules on the intimacy my partner has with others.” In practice, I tend to behave mostly romantically monogamously (prob due to lack of sufficient options i’m interested in), and I have a whole lot of casual sex and am happy to help my partners have casual sex too. I historically have been very helpful for connecting my partners with other women interested in them!\r\n\r\nIm happy to commit time/effort to joint stuff like potential kids or house or ‘relationship development time’, even if it interrupts potential future relationships with other partners.\r\nAbout Me?\r\nThe list of aella-facts is maybe less necessary cause i exhibitionist my personality loudly online into every crevice, but if you want an external list of nice things, my now-casual partner Nate Soares has a document originally entitled “My ex is a shit eating whore” which is literally true but google thought he was trying to be mean so it’s now reuploaded here, where he tells people why i am good to date.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for things about me that are maybe more nonobvious potential dealbreakers for people with specific preferences \r\n\r\n*80% cold culture\r\n*however, can embarrassingly lose all skills when emotionally activated\r\n*messy, horribly, tragically messy, but fortunately i am happy to exchange money for social things\r\n*errs on the side of avoidant\r\n*constantly dealing with stalkers you will have to protect me from\r\n*i do not like directly initiating sex almost ever (tho doesnt mean you cant have as much sex as you want)\r\n*despite playboy once describing me as having the ‘body of a thoroughbred stallion’, in practice i am gremlinesque, have computerneck, shower infrequently, and i sweat way more than normal and have very erratic poops\r\n*not even the most basic cooking skills\r\n*i like being on the computer a whole lot and dont like doing much outside stuff\r\n*not routine oriented (tho i would like to be)\r\n*do not like threesomes\r\n*don’t have the ‘girl magic’ thing that some girls have where they emanate a soft glow of feminine nurturing care\r\n*I’m not nurturing in general. I’m absentminded and am bad at tracking needs when those needs deviate significantly from my own.

      "fullText": "﻿May 2025\r\nDate me?  \r\nHello, I’m Joseph.\r\nThis is one of those documents where I try to articulate how I would make a great romantic partner while fighting the twin British urges to only ever be self-deprecating and to avoid revealing one’s emotions or inner character to anyone.\r\nA man wiser than me said that if we want the rewards of being loved, then we have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known, so, reluctantly, here goes…\r\nThe basics\r\nI am a single straight monogamous bespectacled 5’8” 31-year-old man currently living alone in West London. I am in possession, if not of a good fortune, then at least of a good sense of humour, and am in want of a partner who would eventually be my wife.\r\nI think the most concise way to describe me is as middle class and bookish. If you’re looking for a Hugh Grant/Colin Firth awkward Austen Englishman type but feel that they’re intimidatingly attractive, then today is your lucky day.\r\nFeel free to stalk my Facebook, Twitter, BlueSky, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and personal website, but I’m afraid that I don’t post very much.\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\nI read all these Guardian opinion pieces about how wonderful and liberating it is to be single and I do not relate to them at all. I’m a romantic, and having a partner is very important to me.\r\nI’m looking for a kind, thoughtful person who is intellectually curious with a keen sense of fun. Ideally you’ll share my values, and we’ll have some common interests (see below), but ultimately I’m looking for a partnership where we support and learn from each other, make a continual commitment to work on our relationship, and together are more than the sum of our parts. I’m after someone to share my life with, the sublime and the ridiculous, the ordinary and the extraordinary.\r\nI think kids are great and I would ideally have 2-4, so you’re going to need to be on board with that too. I’m very aware that the burden of having a child falls disproportionately on mothers, so I’m keen to make sure that would not be the case for us. A loving relationship plus kids is a big part of what I want to get out of life, and I’d be willing to sacrifice quite a lot, including forgoing my career, in service to being a better parent and a better partner.\r\nWhat I look like\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I’m like generally\r\nThis is by far the worst bit to write. Reflecting on who you are and how you are perceived by others is a special form of torture.\r\n* Intellectually curious/a giant nerd – I like learning, I spend a lot of time thinking hard about things, and I’m interested in improving myself, my habits, and my thinking. I am easily nerd-sniped with interesting blogs, videos, Twitter threads, podcasts etc. whether about science, history, art, or how it is that Lichtenstein has avoided being eaten by its neighbours. I will want to discuss big philosophical ideas with you, as well as data and graphs, and fun factoids I’ve just learned (the Ancient Egyptian for cat is ‘meow’). Some men will tell you you’re pretty, I will tell you you’re pretty and that ‘pretty’ originally meant ‘cunning, crafty, or clever’ and has the same etymological root as prattle. What more could you want?\r\n* Cultural - There’s a Picasso quote that I love – ‘Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life’. I would like to spend more of my life appreciating and creating art and music and poetry and theatre. I’m part of a book club where we read ancient text together (the Odyssey, the Epic of Gilgamesh etc.), and I’ve recently held a poetry evening and attended a workshop on drawing and carving gothic tracery. An ideal first date would be going to an art gallery, pointing out all the art that we like, and then planning an elaborate heist.\r\n* Wholesome/earnest – I’m no good at being cool or edgy. I’m unironically enthusiastic about trying to be a good person and filling the world with plants and places to be cosy. For example, I’m 100% behind this tweet by Joy Marie Clarkson, an embodiment of wholesomeness that I can only aspire to. I want to create beautiful things in the world. Beautiful objects, events, places, and relationships.\r\n* Judgemental/arrogant – This may seem somewhat at odds with the preceding item, and in some ways it is. Basically, I try to be a nice, accepting, humble person, and then I see a Rightmove listing where someone’s decorated their entire house grey or a report with terrible data visualisation, the red mist descends, and I send my friends 27 messages detailing exactly why it’s terrible and how if only everyone were like me the world would be a lot better. Ideally you too are a slightly terrible person and also delight in privately judging people’s poor design choices.\r\n* Fun - I hesitate to describe myself as funny, that feels like a step too far even for this act of extreme self promotion, but I will say that if I think I can add some humour to a situation then I usually do. I regularly make jokes, usually really awful puns. Sometimes people laugh, sometimes they groan and ask me to leave their home and never speak to them again.\r\nSome things I like doing\r\nHopefully you like doing some of these things too, but I don’t expect us to have all the same interests.\r\n* Learning – See above\r\n* Acquiring books and sometimes reading them – I read quite a lot (though I’m not a 52 books a year kind of person). I typically have a lot of books on the go because I’ve decided I’m an adult and I get to make my own rules, and those rules do not involve having to finish my current book before starting a new one. Having an extensive library complete with ladder and secret door is definitely a life goal.\r\n* Visiting botanic gardens and other green places- I adore botanic gardens, especially ones with glasshouses. If I could live in the Palm House at Kew, I would. I try to visit botanic gardens in any place I am visiting and would ideally become so immensely wealthy that I could create my own. I am also trying to become a person who goes hiking because I enjoy nature and exploring, and I feel like I should at least try to incorporate some exercise into my life.\r\n* Visiting museums, art galleries, National Trust properties etc. – I go and see London exhibitions pretty regularly, usually classical art or history. With some persuasion I will visit the Tate Modern with as open a mind as I can manage so that you don’t think I’m a philistine. If we visit a stately home then it’s a requirement that we talk like we’re in Downton Abbey and glide gracefully down the grand staircase arm in arm.\r\n* Dancing – I go dancing once or twice a week, typically Ceroc (jive/swing) and country dancing (ceilidhing/reeling). I also did a little bit of ballroom while at university. If you want a dance partner who will occasionally step on your toes, look no further.\r\n* Making things – Usually this means digital graphic design, but sometimes I make physical things too. I have designed everything from business cards to massive conference banners for fun and profit. I particularly enjoy making spoofs of things as part of overly elaborate jokes – a Guardian-style exposé infographic about how my friends know each other, an entire website for a fake transportation firm in order to help a friend move house, a hand-illuminated manuscript about how to summon a demon to help you finish your PhD. My friends regularly come to me for hot takes on typography in wedding invitations and data visualisation choices in reports.\r\n* Listening to music - I have no musical talent or knowledge, but I listen to music pretty much all the time. I confuse the hell out of Spotify, because though I primarily listen to classical music, I’m also fond of everything from Taylor Swift, to indie bands, jazz, and Disney songs.\r\n* Playing games – Don’t worry, not with your heart. I play computer games once every few weeks with some friends, and am also up for D&D and board games (but not Monopoly, because that way lies weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth).\r\n* Working – I’m one of those people who enjoys working (in the job sense and the more generally being productive sense). I have two jobs and I always have at least three different personal projects on the go. If any of this became incompatible with also having a relationship, the relationship would be my priority.\r\nSome things I would be up for doing more of\r\nThere are a bunch of things that I could be easily persuaded to do/do more of if you were keen. This list is not exhaustive. If there’s a thing that you really like doing that you would like to do together then there’s a pretty good chance I’ll be up for it.\r\n* More cultural activities – While I like museums, galleries, concerts, the theatre etc. I don’t go to them as often as I would like because I hate going to things by myself, so if you’re a keen theatregoer or similar then I would definitely be up for going to more things.\r\n* More crafty things – I like the idea of being crafty and making actual physical things rather than just digital ones, but I need an incentive to actually do it. I’ve dabbled in drawing, painting, and calligraphy, but haven’t taken them very far yet.\r\n* More travel – I’m not very adventurous – I like the comfort of my home and I can find new environments a bit overwhelming – but if you’re keen on travel, particularly in Europe, then it would not be hard to persuade me. Experiencing the sights and smells of a market in Marrakesh or bungee jumping in Australia? Not for me. Exploring the ruins of a French château or doing a bit of the Appalachian trail? Sign me up!\r\n* More outdoor activities – I am not a naturally outdoorsy or sporty person (I’m told that trying to stay as far away as possible from the ball is not in fact the objective of football), but if, say, you’re a big fan of badminton and wanted us to play every week, then I’d be game. As mentioned above, I like hiking, I’m just not very good at doing it regularly.\r\nSome things I don’t tend to enjoy\r\n* Anything excessively adventurous or noisy - Skydiving, bungee jumping, theme parks, music festivals, wild parties, shopping malls – anywhere with a lot of people and noise is not usually good for me.\r\n* Events focused on food/alcohol - I don’t drink and I have a very low tolerance for drunk people, so pubs, bars, bottomless brunches and the like are very much not my cup of tea (though also neither is tea). I also have a disorder that restricts my diet quite a bit and makes food-focused situations a bit stressful, so if you’re someone who likes spending every weekend trying out new restaurants then I’m afraid it’s unlikely to work between us. To be clear though, that doesn’t mean I’d be at all opposed to you drinking or us going to restaurants on occasion.\r\n* Reality TV – I really can’t stand Love Island and its ilk. Quite apart from being deeply uninteresting to me (see earlier point about being judgemental), I think it brings out and glorifies the worst in people in ways that have serious and lasting repercussions for our society.\r\n* Animals – I’m not an animal person. I smile politely when people start talking about their cat’s antics, and I will gingerly pat a dog if I can see no other way to get out of the situation, but that’s about as far as I’ll go. If you have a particularly adorable and non-threatening animal companion and we are otherwise highly compatible then I might be persuaded.\r\nMy home aesthetics\r\nI won’t show you what my flat looks like because, you know, this is the internet, but below are some examples from my Pinterest home decor board to give you an indication of how many books, plants, and pieces of art I feel is appropriate in a home (though sadly my flat does not look this nice yet). If you think otherwise, I’m willing to be convinced.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nHow I would woo you\r\nIf you’ve got this far I feel like that’s a good sign. Here are some of the ways I would try to seal the deal:\r\n* Listening to you – You know quite a lot about me by this point, so I have some catching up to do. I want to hear what you’re passionate about and learn from you. I will also try to learn your habits/preferences: how you like your tea, how quickly you like responses to your texts, etc. Listening is also the basis for good communication, and good communication is the basis for a healthy relationship, so I will really try very hard on this point.\r\n* Treating you with respect – I’ll never give you up, let you down, run around, or desert you. But seriously, I’m a committed feminist and I’m looking for a relationship of equals based on honesty, trust, and respect. Please call me out immediately if I am ever not treating you with respect.\r\n* Making you laugh – I will make jokes, I will do silly things, I will pull silly faces. If we encounter any highland cows I will attempt to communicate with them by mooing in a Scottish accent. If you tell me you’re hungry, then I will almost certainly respond that I’m the Czech Republic. I will treat laughter and groans as equal indicators of success.\r\n* Sharing things I think you’ll find interesting – I’ll send you articles, Tweets, artwork, memes, music etc. that I think you might enjoy. It’s my way of showing that I’m thinking about you and trying to bring you some joy.\r\n* Buying you gifts, but erratically – I think bad gifts are a plague. This means that I’ll put a lot of effort into trying to come up with good gifts, but also I’ll ignore deadlines like Christmas and birthdays and instead give you something on a random Tuesday in May when it happens to be ready.\r\n* Defending your honour – Inducing the cad who has run off with your younger sister to marry her, thus saving your family from social disgrace.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf it sounds like we might be compatible, then my preferred way of signalling interest is to make eye contact on the tube and then panic and get off early. So far that’s not been very successful, so it’s probably better if you fill in this form, or find some other way to advise me of your interest.\r\nIf you’re not interested in me romantically but think that we might be friends then I might be interested in that too. If you have a friend who you think would be a good fit for me, then I would be extremely grateful if you would please share this document with them."

      "fullText": "﻿Original posted on a personals subreddit in January 2022.\r\nContact: date.mark.1co4i@simplelogin.com \r\n—\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it is courtesy here to apologize for lengthy posts. I can tell you that there's no tl;dr; I hope that scrolling down something would catch your eye, and if I'm lucky, having read a paragraph enticed you to read more. I have very roughly tried to progress from the general to the particular; we know that the devil is in the details but it is the context that imbues it with significance. Words can only do so much to give a sense of a person, and I can hardly imagine a more anonymous place than a personals subreddit. If I may quote from a writer reflecting on his time as a drafted Vietnam war soldier,\r\n\r\n\r\n> I confess that a large number of Americans I met in the Army amazed me by their differentness. I had not known their like before, nor have I met them since. Nothing else could have made me realize how narrow the circle in which we move in peacetime is. Most of us hardly get an inkling of how ninety per cent of our fellows live or think. Naively we assume that they must be like us or not very different.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what is true about the American draft might be yet truer to the vast internet? Or is the variance narrower in Berlin?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy intention here is to give you as much sense of my person without you yet having met me. To read this fully will take you longer than reading other here ads, but less than riding the bike or U-Bahn to meet me, a ride that can be spared if you find something off in here lines from the comfort of your home or phone. If both of us are lucky, perhaps, on the contrary, it would give rise to that ride at the end of which two people, who did not know they missed each other, find each other and share a pleasant evening. And if we are very lucky, perhaps share many days thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a Russia-born, Israel-raised, 33 y/o (since two days!) who came to Berlin in 2014 for a master's and stayed here for work. A bit of an over-thinker, I love musing about and discussing the little and big things: how expectations shape our perception, how perception shapes our understanding of ourselves and the world; how attitudes are formed and how a given culture arises. The human mind, animal behaviour, culture, language, our political and economic system & its history have fascinated me since many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor my bachelor's I studied math and physics. The reason I chose that major was admittedly rather hoity-toity: I can't say it was the subject I was most interested in, but it was among the subject I was interested in and the one that, I thought, would be the most difficult to learn without others to guide me, i.e., teachers. The institution was a so called \"liberal arts college\" in the US and I took ample advantage of the opportunity to take courses outside my major, as well as going so far as borrowing text-books in the library to read over the summer; textbooks about social and evolutionary psychology and behavioural biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started my master's for the \"wrong reasons\". By the last year of my bachelor's I was set to be done with academics and \"start real life\" (as if the term bore significance); I had wanted to leave Israel and to move to Europe. Seeing that it was too complicated to do so otherwise I chose what appeared to be the easiest route in: to start studying there. Since high-school I had had a particular attraction towards Germany, I think because of my Volga-German paternal grandfather who died before I was born, and because my favourite aunt lives in the city, but not wanting to narrow my choices I cast my net broadly, and so I could say I was lucky to find an intriguing program ausgerechnet in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unexpected googling result, the program was in \"computational neuroscience,\" a term I did not know and which I had still not understood after reading its Wikipedia entry, but which, I thought, matched my case: the \"computational\" part matched my educational background and the \"neuroscience\" part matched my interest in the relationship between mind & body and the biological underpinning of human behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program was difficult for me, for reasons that were personal (having looked too much outside my major during my bachelor's, making me somewhat less prepared than others; being used to a different student-professor relationship) and circumstantially unfortunate (not having been prepared for how difficult and time consuming finding a WG in my budget was, which itself brought further hardships), but I finished in good time. This \"good time\" was a long while, longer than programmed, but on par with my peers. As a classmate and friend had said, that it was a 2-years program was a lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy studies were followed by a long and therefore difficult period of job searching, looking for a position as a data-scientist, elongated by my difficulties with German (which since then I speak much better, also in my job), uncertainties about fine points of my then legal status in the country, and mostly by having little connections in Berlin and by being a bad judge of my own skills and abilities, always leaning diffidence-wards. Nonetheless I felt lucky at the end when ––being ready to sell myself to any evil corporation to optimize its commercials or recommendations–– I got a job at a \"medical-tech\" company which employs machine learning to improve diagnostics of health complications during pregnancies. While I was hired as a data scientist, in the last few months, our team being understaffed, I did nothing but implement changes to our app. At least in our company xmas dinner the head of tech voiced that I was over qualified for the work that I was doing and the boss encouraged him to get me out of that and put me on the data as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommitment to writing\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this day whenever I see a great piece of art, whatever the form ––literature, film, paintings, music, video games, furniture––, I'm attracted by the idea of creating something similar, rarely going beyond the act of sketching blue-prints for future projects. What has stuck, however, is the decision I made when I was about 15, that I shall be a writer. For a very long time I had not been much of a writer and was reluctant using that title. I wrote mostly short story beginnings and fragments; I was surprised to find years later that these were not so bad, but all the same they didn't amount to much. When I first came to the US I remember telling others that I would never be able to speak English from the heart, but by a year or so later it had changed, and English is still my language of choice. A creative writing professor on my final year was very supportive; I used to think that she was merely nice, that is, to everyone, but later I heard different experiences from other students. All the same, perhaps I received special treatment as the odd non-literature student. All the same, it was encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy passion is in writing fiction, but I discovered the power of my writing to captivate people (as I hereby try to captivate you) on mundane occasions: emails to a different literature professor, about how I had found it difficult to keep up with the reading, who praised them during class(!) (they were written in an 18th century English, appropriately to the course); an excuse email to a tutor in my master's, for having failed to submit my homework, who wrote me back that I had made her day; personal and philosophizing ––and often admittedly too long–– emails to friends, one of which had asked to forward an email to two friends of hers because she thought \"it would help them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while I was also writing the occasional not very good short story, sending it to one journal I had set my mind on, which has never accepted my submissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a minor breakthrough a few years ago, when I answered an ad recruiting team members to work on a so called indie video game. \"Writers\" were not sought but I found the ad intriguing and contacted the guy anyway, expressing my interest. We had some back and forth, he presented me his idea on a call and I wrote him back my opinion of the project. I expected our connection to end then and there: I was very critical of many aspects of his work, and us being strangers, I thought he would want to not have anything to do with me anymore. I was critical not because I wanted to bring him down or insult him, but precisely because I liked the guy and his attitude and so cared enough to take the time, risk the \"being not nice\" in order to share my point of view. He wrote me back to say that he found my comments helpful, and from then on we collaborated. When I told him that I no longer had time for his project (this was during my job-searching period; my time went to answering postings and on making myself qualified for the positions I was seeking), he offered to pay me to write for his game  –– an offer I accepted. So I may say that I have been paid for my writing, I almost forgot about it. The breakthrough came from the fact that his approach to story-telling/ sharing ideas, let's say, was very akin to mine, and seeing it from the outside I became aware of its shortcomings, storytelling-wise.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust over a year ago I had the last of piecemeal revelations which brought about a major leap. After involving a good friend of mine in my endeavour, I began to write regularly, daily, with clear aims before me. My new expedient attitude had set me to write short stories but my expansive nature (a hint of which you might be picking up) proved to me that I am more of a (potential) novelist. I'm currently working on a novel and I am glad to announce that it has been progressing very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & honesty\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a great part of my life I held honesty (being true) and openness (being transparent) to be prime virtues. These served me well:\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen I was drafted to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, I was put into artillery, a combat unit. While I enjoyed the training (truly a \"guilty pleasure\"), when it came to being part of maintaining the occupation, I couldn't do it. I asked my direct commander for a conversation and laid it out to him: I didn't believe in this and that, refused to continue cooperating, and explicitly expressed my willingness to go to military prison if my words amounted to insubordination. I was surprised to find that the commander ––whose very different political leaning/ worldview was known (I was amused when he told me that his girlfriend was \"just like that, too\")–– responded very graciously. The rest of the story is rather involved to lay down here completely, but the bottom line was that honesty received its points. I approached my problem with words and it was rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there was the matter already written here, about coming to my teachers and making explicit my shortcomings as a student, which were always met with support. I also wouldn't forget how in high-school a good friend of mine came to the math teacher with his graded exam and showed her how one of his solutions, despite a mistake he had made, was marked as correct. She answered that he was right that he was wrong, but let him keep the grade. Together with other friends I remonstrated, though only in jest, we respected his action.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally with my friends I always found that opening up yielded positive results. I wouldn't forget how towards the end of my second year of college my roommate wrote me a long Facebook message where he expressed a resentment he had towards me, to which thitherto I was unaware, mentioning that \"[I] remembered how you told me once that it's better to talk about issues rather then holding on to it, so I thought it would be good for us to talk about it.\" He vented his grudges, I apologized, we discussed it and sorted it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I have also experienced the limits of honesty. My tête-à-têtes with commanders buoyed up the ranks up to the battalion commander who did not, like the others, simply hear me out, but \"argued\" with me. After that conversation I deliberated with myself about whether in some circumstances \"lying was ok.\" Recognizing the shortness of the power of my words, I resorted to action –– which despite the military settings and my internal sense of drama, did not involve helicopters, shooting or explosions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in college I told my Nabokov course professor that I couldn't, that is, wouldn't, write the final paper for the course because I had a greater calling (my then novel in writing) and she gave me the grade that I deserved, adjusted by sympathies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my long job-searching period my honest but implicit importing of my lack of ability to assess the comparison between my relevant skillfulness with that of the imagined potential competition's might have been taken as an expression of a lack of aptness in the skills themselves, or so one could imagine. And so I did imagine, along with hundreds other stories of why it was that I wasn't getting a job (none of which, though you probably didn't think so, had to do with immigrants).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the army I was trying to \"follow the rules\", to follow my agreeable nature <3, while not following them. I now wonder that there was an effect that was as paradoxical as that in the liar's paradox. I observed once a soldier being immediately punished upon his refusal to pick up a shell during drilling (I now wonder if I had been anything to inspire; it was after my disobedient \"coming out\" and I was passing by him), a response very different to the one I had received. My refusal bore the structure of \"I thereby break the rule,\" and had the effect of excusing myself from all that I did not want to do while being dealt with as if I was operating within the rules. For a long period I was let to merely \"hang around\", only being assigned only cleaning and watch duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my Nabokov course professor I was being honest when I told her that I wanted to dedicate the time to my fiction project, but I was in fact also proving myself a point, namely, that I was free from the expectations of institutions, or, more exactly, that I came to school to learn and not to be accredited, and since I was not going to continue on the academic path (which turned to be false) my final grades were not important and putting the effort to prove a professor that I deserved her good opinion and thereby sacrificing my art(!!) was plain silly. And perhaps I wanted her to think of me as a bud of something as great as Nabokov. And also I was trying to repeat a trick that did work for me in Freshman year (A; but there was more heart in it) than in that senior year (C; if I recall correctly).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of the above? It is not the case that honesty per se has rendered me a disservice, but rather that being honest is not always very trivial. For one thing, words do not merely carry the information they directly encode, but establish a certain relationship between the speaker and recipient. As you are reading it, presumably, you are not building a picture of myself based just on the content of my words, but also on my choice of things to include, their order, what I exclude. You might wonder, to put it simply, why I am telling you certain things.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is the reason why I enjoy having \"theoretical discussions\" with people with Asperger's or who are close to \"that end of the spectrum\"; from my experience they don't take their opinions so personally so when I disagree with them they don't take it to mean that \"I dislike them\" or that \"we do not get along\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon which seems to me to best capture the dynamic between words and the relationship they engender between the people using them is that of flirting. And I think what is true with flirting, in a long but circumscribed moment between two persons, is true for all interpersonal communications and their Wittgensteinian language games.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the flirters do? There's a play that is not merely about reflecting reality as one sees it but about negotiating, implicitly, the creation of a new reality: the potential transformation of a \"one and a one\" into \"a two\" into a different kind of \"one\"; the flirters bring in their expectations of the nature of this new unit, they bring in their expectations of the expectations of the other person, they discuss the unit, they gauge the other's willingness and adequateness and entice the other into the unit by proving that they are fit for their own part. There's always the question: is the other merely a nice person, that is, nice to everybody, or specifically nice to me? Is this person habitually touchy or are they hitting on me? Does the other person tell me about their recent break up because they have an urge to share the fresh experience? Because they want advice? Because they want to communicate to me their availability?\r\n\r\n\r\nA memory of non-flirting comes to my mind. I was at a Berlin lake's beach. A small group of cheerful gals was sitting on the next spot. A guy, who evidently had had some interaction with them earlier, approached and spoke to one of them. He said that he was new in the city, that he didn't know much people, and asked if she would be his friend, wanted to exchange numbers. I had a perfect view of this interaction, and I suspected that the naive and simple approach was a poorly disguised trick, that he was trying to pick her up, and the gal, who was not born yesterday, must have suspected likewise. As you might imagine, the gal declined his kind offer and after a bit of insistence the guy left. What works in kindergarten (and in A Beautiful Mind) often doesn't work in the adult world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI admit that, unfortunately, I'm not good at flirting, but I recognize that while words can try to describe that which happens between one person and another, they cannot define it, cannot conjure it out of nothingness by themselves. It seems to me that people don't even always know what they themselves want, and if they do, they don't know what they might desire in the future, after they discover something or their circumstances change. Words are a combination of bearing witness to the present, reporting on the past and making a prediction, or a promise, onto the future, and therein their ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do we remain honest, report things about ourselves as they are, when we are aware that we are constantly changing? When we know that we continue to disappoint our own selves? When we know, perhaps, that our self disappointment is a sign that we had set ourselves high-bars that we worked hard to strive towards, without which we would have remained lying on the bottom? How do we promise \"eternal love\" when we have no regard for any church's allotted sanctity and we witness divorces as a normal occurrence around us, and know that we, too, are only human?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you understand, this is not a call for dishonesty, lack of commitment or the abandoning of communication of needs and expectations. It is not the case that I think that words are meaningless or that \"there's no truth\" (I'm already answering protractors, but I trust that you understand me). No. This is a petition to act out a relationship between us\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere language is used to improve each other's and our surrounding's lives and conditions –– I don't mean that we will fix the world with words, but that we won't violently force words upon it, or argue about words as if they were the matter themselves;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere we employ language as a tool to understand each other and not to bind each other, committed to the idea that each one of us has one's needs, desires, energies and fancies that need to be humoured and supported in our effort of maintaining our togetherness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it has not been yet stated quite so unequivocally: I am looking for a single woman to form a dyad with, to give meaning to each other with, to figure out the world with, and when the world is ready for it, raise some children with. There. This last part goes somewhat against what I mentioned when on the topic of flirting, but as there are people who are certain they do not want to have children it made sense to mention it. But that would anyhow be in the far future, and we do not need to discuss it yet. We take it all in baby-steps. We are considerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & Shyness\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the big drama of my adolescence. When I was 12 I realized that I was shy. It's seems funny to me that such things have to be learned, but there's no escape from the fact that when we are born we do not \"know ourselves,\" in the most trivial sense, and need time to be discovered to our own selves. Need \"time\" meaning the occasion for the discovery; in my case it was watching the series Neon Genesis Evangelion with its timid protagonist Shinji. It incited an interest in psychology, which the then young internet (pre-google!) led me to believe equaled Freud's Id and Ego and the rest of it. I diagnosed myself with \"social phobia\", a recognition with which I turned with glee, as if I had solved a great mystery, to others: to classmates on MSN messenger, with whom I hadn't otherwise spoken in school, who listened; to my friends, one of which mocked my diagnosis and denied it. Be as it may, I found out soon enough, on a classmate's Bar Mitzvah party, that being aware of a problem is not quite 80% of having solved it, and that while Shinji supposedly overcame his issues on the last episode I had watched that same day, he did it alone ––– without me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked my parents to take me to the therapist, which they did. I remember drawing a boy, describing it, and being shy about drawing a girl. This sounds caricaturistic, but I remember being given the Rorschach test, and describing a scene of two alien kingdoms sealing an accord of peace with the touch of their leaders' long index-fingers ––– a scene that upon searching it years later, though having found the implicated Card X, I couldn't again see. At a trough I was suggested antidepressants and I must have hinted willingness because next the psychiatrist and my parents appeared; I also remember that the offer was left to me to decide (by the staff? by my parents? unaware of it when young, I was almost amazed when I reflected on it as an adult at the degree of trust my parents had always put in me) and that I declined it. I don't remember how long I attended sessions; it was at least a few months and less than a year. I had gotten some insights out of it but eventually decided that I felt like it was not helping me much, and I was out. This, by the way, was the last time that I sought \"professional help\" for \"mental health\" related issues, though not the last time that I suffered of anything of that sort. That being said, while still occasionally having been afflicted with depression afterwards, I am happy to say that since my early twenties I have learned to cope with the little devils in my head and since two years they are positively gone (without, as Rilke has put it, the angels having fled with them).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout my adolescence I invested a lot of thought into my problem of shyness, and what brought the eventual succour was a simple change of circumstances. For 9 years I had attended the same school, the same class of 40 kids, and the simple transition to a different school, when high-school came around, and its requirement to make new acquaintances, was of great help. I did not make it very easy for it to do so, however: in my high-school the classes were reshuffled every year, with the exception of two: one which was \"special\" in the euphemistic sense (but not too special; I think it was called the \"sports class\") and the other was the gifted class. I tell you right away that I had not undergone any tests to get into the latter. When I came to register for high-school ––I remember being alone with the secretary in her office–– I said that I wanted to be in gifted class. That was enough to get admission. It's one thing with young rosy cheeked children, I suppose a teenager's willingness alone, in that angsty age, is enough of a criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in high-school I put myself in one \"extreme\" of being again in the same class and its group of students all-throughout, the army (which is a whole story on its own) was on the other: already mid-training I had been moved from one unit to another, a pattern that continued until my discharge with a rough average of one month per unit, having to make new acquaintances on each transition. It was during this time, incidentally, that the seeds of my affection towards FKK had been sown; it made as much sense to go to the showers together as it did to go to dinner together. Why shower alone when you can shower and have a conversation at the same time? This idea comes to me now for the first time in my life: let's have two showers. Make it big, give it two showerheads, so we could shower together. Tongue in the cheek but serious nonetheless!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army was the beginning of the end of my problem. I know that in college I still considered myself an introvert because a TED talk about introverts inspired me to follow the advice of \"taking advantage of what introverts were good at\" (I'm paraphrasing) and \"express myself in writing rather than face to face\" to tackle an uncertainty that I had in the wooing of my then crush. I copied (unnecessarily, though it felt more personal that way) in handwriting a long letter that I composed for her. That I ended up awake until four in the morning was because of the calligraphy I rendered on the front page, which I thought was not so bad for a first attempt. This, as you might imagine, did not work so well, and was hinged partially on the misguided sense that a romantic relationship could be agreed on when in fact it should be developed. And on my impatience, perhaps. If it was the first then I admit it was not the last of grand gestures made thus by me for such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen sonnets that I wrote to a stranger who had twitted \"Pablo Neruda wrote a hundred sonnets to his wife while I can't get a guy to go to acro yoga with me idgi\" won me a phone number + a reserved willingness to meet for coffee, but either my apologetic reply email or my stumblings on our short WhatsApp correspondence made her turn the other cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen was a long half love letter half Ode to Berlin written to an Ok-Cupid connection. We had corresponded extensively on the days preceding her visit to Berlin, had a skype and hung out a couple of times while she was here. I sent her the email while she was travelling in Hungary after Berlin. Well: she didn't want to have anything with me afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have learned my lesson, alluded to on the previous section about words and honesty, and that Ode to Berlin was the last time I attempted anything of this sort. I am not unaware that this here post is of the same genre, me jumping around, feeling like a bird of paradise trying to captivate your attention and pique your interest. However, this time I do not pretend that I know who you are, nor what sort of relationship we might develop together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy have I written so much? Am I desperate? Crazy? Obsessed?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not desperate, but concerned. Indeed, my self sufficiently leads me to believe that if I do not do anything about it, I could easily go through life by myself. A good friend joked that I was preparing for the covid situation all of my life. Indeed, I am not unhappy alone but I am often sad that I do not share my life with more people. And my wish to make a family one day is dear to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrazy? Maybe a little but not in disconcerting ways. I have, anyhow, encouraged others' notion of myself as being a little fou fou; people start to expect the unexpected, in little ways, which means that they do not quite judge me by their usual standards, which is liberating. Or this is how I have explained it to myself; perhaps they do judge me all the same within themselves but they have not complained and I am happy to beat my own drum.\r\n\r\n\r\nObsessive? Maybe. It took me a good decade and a half to cultivate a passion for writing, and it is there that my obsession perhaps lies; it is no less powerful for being self-made. As it may be, I enjoy writing, telling stories, sharing my ideas and, most of all: having conversations, for which writing could hopefully at least (but also: only so much) set a table. As Yoel Hoffmann wrote in \"Curriculum Vitae\":\r\n\r\n\r\n> If I could [in a sort of pact that was deeper than that between an author and a reader] fall on the necks of people and tell them: come and let us sit and steep tea and drink and you will tell me your life and I will tell you my life, I would have tossed the manuscript in the paper bin and done it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I see it, I'm just trying to present myself and attract the like minded. I'm not trying to dance the tango alone. This post is not the final word but the excuse, the occasion, to discuss things. Any written word, anyhow, can remain valid only so long. This is just the beginning, as Melannie C sings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of college I was no longer sure how valid my former placement of myself on the introvert-extrovert scale was, important only as a function of my interest in the so called Big Five Model. I have been enthusiastic and talkative in companies I cared about since childhood, only it took a couple of decades for me to find myself comfortable with people I had just met. Consulting Wikipedia, I'd say I suppose I am indeed an introvert, only the social aspects don't quite apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of the long way it had taken me, this is something I am proud of to the point of bragging about it:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first came to college I held the childish bratty opinion that people who danced were shallow and stupid. A year and a half later I sought to \"learn to dance\": I asked a roommate and a friend about it; the one told me that he didn't actually know how to dance (I thought otherwise) and that he had always felt ashamed whenever he went to clubs where were good dancers; the other told me to make love to the music. With this information and with the simple yet very useful Wikihow instructions on the topic(!) (ask me about it; I bet it has changed since then. Now it probably includes the steps \"stay hydrated\" and \"eat fresh fruit\") I gradually came to the present point where dancing is one of my favourite things to do. Unfortunately these plague days have not offered much opportunity to dance with other people, though I do it from time to time alone in my room. And the braggy part: already then a friend told me that I was the best dancer in our college, which I thought was a mighty exaggeration but I took it anyway. Since then almost every time that I dance in public, at night (I guess people have to be at least a little tozy-mozy), a stranger(!) would approach me to compliment my dancing. Once a person came to me and handed me a flower \"for the best dancer on the dancefloor.\" Among my circles enthusiastic dancers are not so common, so I welcome getting know people with this passion :) But as I said, most of the people I like are not keen dancers, so that's fine, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first dialogues that I ever came up with, even though I didn't write them down, were a direct consequence of my shyness. On the afternoon that serves as the best example, I was working myself up to call to book tickets for games on a then forthcoming RPG conference. I couldn't, in my anxiety, just pick up the phone and call. Instead, I imagined the interaction, playing through the various possible sequences of the imminent exchange, depending on whether there were still seats on this or that game, all the while pacing my room back and forth. Possibly it had taken an hour until I did manage to make the call.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference was not very easy, nonetheless; I find amusing the notion of being shy/awkward within a gathering for playing pen and paper RPG, stereotypically perhaps the geekiest of activities. Having been an outlier age-wise in the conference (still in middle-school, not sure what year this was), did nothing to improve. Towards the end of one of the games attention was turned to me; this was an act of kindness by one Idit ––I knew her as a personality on the Israeli RPG forum–– who wanted to include the thitherto quiet player. I became flustered and I felt my cheeks growing warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of my shyness that has to do with my writing, as well as with the attitude I have developed towards \"honesty\", was a fear ––if that's the right word–– of lying. Equipped with an inaccurate theory of mind, it seemed to me that any potential lie was obvious in its deviation from the truth. It occurred to me recently that fiction writers are really professional lie-yarners. My shying away from \"being caught lying\" had made fiction writing difficult to me, but at the same time, I believe, it leads me to write better. I carefully scrutinize all I write and it helps making the text hold better together.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFiction writers make a certain implicit ceremony, like shamans summoning spirits to possess them, before they begin their narration (and when they don't, as was the case with \"A Million Little Pieces\", things do not remain quiet), and we do not take their words at face value. Nonetheless, it's precisely the extent to which their stories ring true that we enjoy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & Sex\r\n\r\n\r\nIf hunger can be the excuse or opportunity to create something beautifully tasty, so can be the urges of the loins. While I esteem some of Buddhism's ideas regarding wanting & suffering, I think life is to be enjoyed. Perhaps am an epicurean, in the sense of valuing the cultivated pleasure, but maybe that's just hot air. I think life should be enjoyed –– the generality of this sort of sentence's amounts to be meaningless without some context, but I don't know that I could articulate it. Godard films spring to my mind, perhaps due to my idea of the French idea of joi de vivre, though I can't say I recall Belmondo ever playing anybody who particularly enjoyed life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to give you the wrong impression that my life is full of indulgent sensuality and excitement. I love hiking but I do not do it often, and if you find me in the jungle with a knife in my teeth, it is likely to be in imagination and not in body. I would have loved to be surrounded by harpists and marble, eating oysters inside a warm milk bath, but I choose my battles: on can have some but not all pleasures the world has to offer, and I'm mostly aiming at a different category. A year or two ago I did fix myself a hot bath and read in it. The effort, aggravated by the fact that the boiler's volume was smaller than the bathtub's, that the water cooled down rather quickly, that there was scarcely a dry place to put the book down on, made it not worth it. And still I repeated this once or even twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think our fancies should be obliged!\r\n\r\n\r\nI think what I value most is the pursuit of art and science, which I find to be close kin of each other rather than the polar opposites they often portrayed as. Let us invest our resources into meeting our needs, into sustaining ourselves, and the rest into creating the true and beautiful, whether taken by our senses or by our thoughts –– or, as often is the case, by their combination. Sounds lofty, I suppose, but a good direction to go in. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy French friends might look askance at me saying it, but I take some care to eat tastily. And when I make food for others I try to make it beautiful. I would not forget how my father (who has never cooked) heated up in the microwave for my return from school a simple dish of rice and toppings that my mom had made, and presented it as \"The seven samurai climbing up a snowy mountain\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hold the above all the more so with regards to sex since in it, in a sense, we consume each other, and therefore take the relish personally. One could either gobble up potatoes to kill one's stomach rumbles, or take the most out of a meal by using it to express care, explore the senses, keep oneself healthy and in love with life. I call for sex to be used to relieve each other's stresses, to let us understand each other's and our own bodies better, learn our pains and pleasures. I would not have said it if I didn't get the idea that some view it differently, but in sex I had relished nothing more than the expressions of pleasure of my partner. My own little death, if you allow me, is almost a disappointment, like the end of a good movie that is bound to come but oh how we wish there was more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, sex could be used to negotiate and to come in terms with each other: sex is but a special case, the case where it is most obvious that our requirements are asymmetrical. What is fair? 1:1 can be fair but so could 3:1. This depends on how we measure fairness, which could hark back to the old but ever present economical question of \"what is value\". Does it depend on the intensity of the need, of the satisfaction, of the effort to bring it? I say: let us be generous, to ourselves and each other, in sex and otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosting this ad\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like it's not the place, but nonetheless I want to start with a technological lament. Perhaps you are familiar with it, perhaps not: OK-Cupid, a little more than five years ago, was a great tool. I met through it my last girlfriend, I've met one of my still best friends, and had numerous other nice interactions. I found its q&a based \"match\" calculations to be neat and helpful. Since then it has been sold and transformed into an awful Tinder-like slot machine. This has nothing to do with the present ad, but: I certainly think that the world needs to have such a platform recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth though I still have an account there and if you do too, we could look at the percentage. Perhaps we are the kind that trust that math.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking for a job my finances were so stringent that it made me often eschew even going out with friends, to say nothing of dating. I had a real sense of lying outside society by the void in my pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that it is not a consideration, society is amidst a plague. My employment straddles its very beginning: I was offered my job before \"Corona\" meant anybody anything but a beer, and signed the contract with a mask and disinfected hands. Between these two points was a dramatic suspense. The confirmation of the project's budget by the Charité was delaying and I worried that money would be redirected to virus-related research, of which our project was not one, leaving my own travails ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince a couple of months I've joined a few meetup book-clubs and already made a friend, and then came the great new surge of covid cases that pushed people back to online meetings. Well, you know the situation, I don't need to tell you about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fancifully hopeful intention is to be able to make a connection, like magic, through these here words. I say \"like magic\" not just because the effect would be brought up by a spell, but because the effect itself is akin to the sudden appearance of something out of nothing, like a pigeon inside a hat. I'm thinking here of Hannah Arendt and her writing (which I hold very dear), and how she formulated the coming into the world of people as the emergence of the New. She was referring to birth, but it applies to new connections just the same –– a person emerging into the world of another. With all respect to \"Recommended to you\" algorithms, is there any occurrence more transformative and opening than the meeting and the engagement with a like minded stranger? Yes, my hopes are lofty but all the same worthy of the effort. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is explicitly an ad to find a partner, but I would be happy to make new friends of any gender as well, so if you are not looking, taken or already interested in me only otherwise, I encourage you to write me too. It's all very far from it, but I have had fantasies of living in a Seinfeld-world where friendly faces barged through the door unbidden. College was a little like this, and though at each moment I did not welcome unwelcome barging-ins, I knew that it made life better. I'm in Berlin, as the title has it, and though I recognize that our contact would begin and incubate online, my hope is that sooner than later we would sit around a shared table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't expect things to happen quickly. As mentioned before, this is just the beginning. Love, as I see it, is not about \"finding the right one,\" but about finding someone with whom to earn each other's trust to cultivate together a shared life. I'm thinking here of Alain de Botton's idea of \"Lovers needing to be each other's teachers\". One doesn't find love but grows it. A paragraph from Williams' Stoner comes to mind, too:\r\n\r\n\r\n> In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is stepping somewhat ahead, but in case it might be on your mind: I don't feel strongly rooted in Berlin. I have ogled the north and I can imagine an eventuality of myself moving to settle elsewhere, but at the same time I don't currently have a reason to do so. Learning German did make me break sweat, but no matter. Loving languages I'd be glad for a good reason to learn a new one. I'll learn yours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn appendix of books and movies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest ––from here down–– is much less important, and is provided for the sake of further self-description (to the extent such things testify) and maybe an opportunity for discussion –– some things I recently watched, read, listened to. I'll be glad to take your recommendations and opinions of recent things you stumbled upon :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI listen quite a lot to youtube videos whose audio I scrape, mostly talks and lectures. Podcast I've been listening recently to are Andrew Huberman's *Huberman Lab* podcast (I'd describe it as \"applied neuroscience\"; he's very careful with the statements he makes and has a nice voice) and David Harvey's *Anti-Capitalist Chronicles*. I used to listen to quite a lot of Zizek in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent films:\r\n\r\n\r\n*The French Dispatch*. Because I love Wes Anderson, admire his attention to detail, I'm hesitant to say that I liked this film but was a little disappointed. I liked it less than any of his others. At the same time, he was experimental here in ways new to him and there's one thing that ––to me significant–– distinguishes it from him previous work, so I tell myself that it's a turning point for him and he needs time to find his new vision. It's also possible that I'd like it better on a second viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n*My Octopus Teacher*. I didn't like the narration, nor the style of the film, but I found it interesting. More than it taught me something about octopuses, it taught me about humans.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Never look away*/ *Werk ohne Autor* – loved it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaundry list of other recent movies I watched and loved: *Dolor y Gloria* (Pain and Glory); *Брат* 1 and 2; *Microhabitat*; *Gespenster* (Ghosts); *Krótki film o miłości*; *Wife of a Spy*; *Pirosmani*.\r\n\r\n\r\nI no longer see \"favourite\" to be very useful a term in this context, but for whatever it's worth, for a long time I considered *Lost in Translation* to be my favourite film. I remember when I first saw a poster for it, though I first watched it much later, when it came out on DVD. The attention the poster evoked in me probably has to do with the title and my then Japanophilia –– the title was translated in Hebrew to \"Lost in Tokyo\"; is this irony or art? Later \"my favourite\" became \"Adaptation\", which I find very close to my heart. Either way, I'm looking forward for Sophia Coppola's and for Charlie Kaufman's next films. As well as those of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks: the last book I read was *Cloud Atlas*. It was recommended by my aforementioned encouraging writing teacher, years ago, and had long stood on my shelf unattended. For some reason I thought I wouldn't like it (that there was a film based on it probably had, I must admit, something to do with it) but I was quickly captivated once I started. I loved it. Also, recently:\r\n\r\n\r\nAuster's *The New York Trilogy*, which I loved (and have too much to say about).\r\n\r\n\r\nI read most of Franzen's *Crossroads* but abandoned it towards the end. I had enjoyed it enough that if it was not the first of three installments I would have finished it. It's greatest offense was being under-edited (look who's talking, you might say!) and so I didn't care to go on. I did love his *The Corrections*, however. Generally, I'm trying to cultivate the habit of abandoning books that I don't enjoy and whose only promise is a sense of completion by their end.\r\n\r\n\r\nI loved Morrison's *Beloved*; Ishiguro's *Never Let me Go*; Plath's *The Bell Jar*.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad ambiguous feelings towards Zalkow's *a brilliant novel in the works*.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust started McEwan's *On Chesil Beach*, loving it so far; am at the midst of Mazzucato's *The Value of Everything*, finding it very informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since my WG turned into a Zweck WG (planning to move out) where I'm the only one eating at the kitchen, on days I work from home, I watch series. Currently watching *Breaking Bad* and *BoJack Horseman*, loving the latter in particular. Loved *Rick and Morty* (but who doesn't?) until that season when it wasn't it anymore. I suspect *The Wire* will nonetheless forever stand at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I do programming I like to listen to fast paced loud music such as that of Ling Tosite Sigure, Lightning Bolt, Igorrr. When I want to fondle my ears I listen to Animal Collective, Do Make Say Think, Amon Tobin, Mr. Bungle. The advice given to Charlie in *Adaptation* is \"wow them at the end\", but when I finish personals ads I end on a melancholic note."

I'm open to both monogamous and polyamorous relationships.\n(More photos\nhere\n.)\nWhat I Want\nI’m attempting to live with an\nopen heart\n, robust ethics, and scrupulous epistemic standards.\nI want relationships, romantic or platonic, that are about helping me become wiser, more competent, and more ethical, and/or helping people who I like and respect become better by their own lights.\nMy favorite people tend to be extremely hardcore Effective Altruists, monastics that have sworn a vow of service to all life, and highly emotionally-attuned vegan therapists.\nI'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship:\na low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the one hand,\nand a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the other.\nWeekly-ish companionship\nCurrently, I’m mainly looking for more companionship in my life.\nI would like to have someone to spend time with about once a week: talking, circling, cuddling, having sex, being curious together, all with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other about our desires and our relationship.\nThis kind of relationship amounts to approximately what poly people call a \"secondary partnership\": emotionally intimate, but not the primary structure of one's life. This might work best for someone who already has a primary partner, or who is otherwise committing most of their energies to a high intensity project.\n(\nThis somewhat-out-of-date document\ngives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)\nHigh-intensity Partnership (with a capital P)\nIn the long run, I would like to find a\nspiritual collaborator\n*, for the other half of an\naltruistic power couple\n.\nI want a Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom, and who will mutually support me in doing the same. A relationship in which we work together, train together, rest together, and help each other to live in integrity with our values. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time\nworking\n, and almost no time on conventional leisure activities (like watching movies together or going to parties).\nWhen I've dated people in the past, I've spent a lot of time and attention trying to\nhelp them get better\n. For example, having long conversations (or writing personalized essays) to convey the blindspots I observe in my partner's in-practice philosophy, or working with her to triangulate her skill gaps and to develop practice exercises that address them. Ideally, I'd like a partner who orients towards\nme\nand and\nmy\nweaknesses in a similar way—actively looking out for the things that I'm missing, then helping me to see them, understand them, and improve them—with skill and compassion.\nI have been seeking something like this since I was 15. It’s one one of the desires that I hold closest to my heart. But, at this point, I’m mostly not expecting to find/develop this kind of Partnership, at least before the singularity. Currently, I am constructing a life in which I can learn, and get better, and execute effectively, without the support of a life partnership. But at the same time, I'm\nalso\nkeeping out feelers in case an extremely compatible woman, who is also living this kind of life, crosses my path.\n(Some more operationalization of what this kind of relationship might look like\nhere\n.)\n* - To be clear, I am an atheist and an antitheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are\nbeyond the reach of God\n. But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.\nThe life I'm living\nI’m often happiest when I’m working, and when my life is going well, I work a lot. Most days, I’m working, or\nexplicitly resting\n, from 30 minutes after waking up to shortly before sleep (with a daily break for intense exercise). I structure my day to maximize my\nenergetic amplitude\n, so that to a first approximation, I’m either intensely alert and focused, or napping, but rarely in a middling state. I aggressively optimize for\nexcellent sleep\n.\nI very rarely socialize outside of work. When I see my friends, it's almost always for one of us to help the other think through a personal problem. I eat one meal a day (most frequently kale, sauteed in olive oil, with toasted tofu). I only very occasionally watch movies or TV, and generally set myself up to\navoid passively consuming content\n(eg I write at least one sentence about every piece I read).\nOutside of my core altruistic projects, I spend time\nexercising\n, reading (mostly AI stuff, history books, sometimes textbooks), writing\nblog posts\n, and sometimes hacking on\nsmall software projects\n. On the scale of months, I’m often doing some progression of\ndeliberate self-development\n: identifying a pressing skill gap, and then iteratively designing and doing exercises to develop the relevant subskills. I review anki most days.\nMost weeks, I take off\none day\n(and one evening) to rest, decompress, and do whatever feels most nourishing. Some rest day activities include: journaling, reading, writing, strength training, cleaning up my room, singing and memorizing folk songs (while walking around the neighborhood), going to the dog park to spend time with the dogs, meditating. When I’ve had a partner, I’ve enjoyed cuddling with her.\nWhen I have the capacity to take time off from work, I like doing doing various kinds of workshops and trainings, especially those that give me experience with interesting psychological states or faculties:\nmeditation\n,\nimprov\n,\ntherapy techniques\n, etc. (I don't do drugs, though.)\n(Additional detail on my weird, intense, lifestyle can be found\nhere\n.)\nConstraints and relationship-essentials\nWork\nOut of a combination of personal inclination and moral commitment, I work\na lot\n. I'm genreally at the office almost all my waking hours, 6 days a week (and usually for a few hours on my rest day, as well).\nAnyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with me working that, either because you have a similar orientation to the world themselves (maybe we can spend time coworking together?), or because you’re comfortable with a relationship that is emotionally intimate without being time-intensive.\nHonesty\nThe thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty.\nI've sometimes been in a context where there was a\nforbidden conversation\n, some true fact, or some belief I held, that I didn't feel free to acknowledge\n. In a situation like this, I feel pressure to pretend about, or distract from, or downplay the thing.\nI’ve come to think that I can’t build a robust relationship on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.\nCreating those kinds of contexts by merely\nintending to be honest\nisn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't do undue harm.\nI make explicit considered effort in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback) in a way that the other party can hear it without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty,\nNonviolent Communication\n,\nrationality\n, and\ncircling\nskill.\nBut even so, I am not a master at this. I still sometimes find myself in situations where there's something that feels too awkward to share even in otherwise candid relationships. I need help to maintain this kind of connection.\nIt is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward. This is crucial for me in an intimate relationship.\nMeta\nRelatedly, relationships with me typically involve a lot of “meta”: doing checkins, talking about the relationship and how it is or isn't working, flagging frictions and generating creative solutions together, investing effort trying to improve our communication processes, etc.\nSome past partners have found this onerous or annoying. “Can’t we skip all the process talk, and just do the cool things that the relationship is about?” I don’t see it that way. Much of what I care about in a relationship is the strength of the relationship itself, and this sort of meta and process-iteration is a means to that.\nCompletely unironically, leaving comments on my relationship-communication google docs is one of my love languages. (The google doc format is optional. That's just a communication method that has worked well for some past partners.)\nRelationship style\nI'm dispositionally monogamous, generally preferring to commit to only one person. However, I am happy to date people who have other partners themselves, especially if I can see that that makes them happy.\nI have only ever seriously dated one person at a time, and incidentally, I have only ever seriously dated people who were poly. (Effectively, I was monogamously partnered with someone who was dating other people.)\nI am more than willing to participate in a fully-monogamous partnership, if we're a good fit. I've dated poly people, not because I particularly prefer poly, but because the people I've been interested in have been poly.\nKids\nRaising kids appeals to me, but I’m not currently planning around having a family in the pre-singularity. However, I would do that if I found a\nhighly\ncompatible partner and having kids was important to her.\nThat is to say, I am\nopen\nto having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.\n(I might actively seek out a partner for raising a family after humanity is out of the\nacute risk period\nand life extension is solved.)\nSex\nSex is more important to me in the case of a once-or-twice-a-week companion than in the case of a committed Partnership. The point of having a capital-P partnership is mostly to help each other be better. For that, sex can be nice, but it isn't necessary. In the case of a more casual relationship, sexual and intimate emotional satisfaction is a larger fraction of what I care about.\nI’m interested in doing deliberate practice to get good at sex: focusing on my partner’s experience, with ample verbal and nonverbal feedback (plus after-action debriefs). It would obviously be better to do this with an emotionally-intimate partner, but I'm potentially open to trying with someone who I'm not otherwise dating, if we can establish really good communication and clarity about expectations first.\nVegetarianism\nI'm vegan (with\nsome caveats\n). So far, 100% of the people that I've dated seriously and 100% of the people that I've ever been in love with have been vegan. This is mostly correlation—the sort of people that I tend to be attracted to tend to be vegans. But it's\nalso\ncausal—I care about the ethics of the people I spend time with. For most people, eating factory farmed meat is the habit that causes the most direct harm to others. (Additionally, seeing someone eat meat tends to reduce my level of attraction for them.)\nI'm not confident, but I think I probably don't want to date people who aren't vegetarian, or who aren't otherwise careful about the externalities their life has on animals in factory farms.\nI'm not listing this as a firm deal-breaker, but it is important to me. If you eat factory farmed meat, and we get moderately far into dating, I'll want to have an honest and reasoned conversation with you about the ethics and tradeoffs involved.\n(I'm conscious that abstaining from animal products entirely is not a healthy choice for some people, and that there are additional tradeoffs.)\nSome friends' descriptions of me:\nFriend 1:\n\"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”\nFriend 2:\n\"Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at.\"\nFriend 3:\n“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”\nIf you want to say hello...\nIf any of the above sounds interesting to you, or even if you just want to say hi,\npress\nthis button\nto tell me your name and a few sentences about you (or just email me\nhere\n). Maybe we can meet up the next time\nwe're in the same metropolitan area.\nI'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. In\nan important way\n, your\ndoing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you.\nIf you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, you might explore the rest of this site, particularly the\npublic statements page\n, or flip through my\nblog\nand/or\narchived twitter threads\n.\nAid my quest!\nIf you’re not a good match with me (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed,\nyou can help by connecting me with thoughtful single (or non-polysaturated) women who want the sort of thing that I want.\nIf you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my\ngratitude\n."

You ask questions and share ideas but, beautifully, all of the movement and growth and opening is me, my own. Things are so shockingly possible and I’m so grateful to be realizing that with the help of your beautiful example and brilliant thinking-with. All my love. 🔆” \r\n-T, a dear friend & confidant \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBringing “now do a fun one” to weddings everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnline dating profiles can be limited and imprecise, so I jotted down a bunch of personal information that should make this process easier. I’ve also enabled commenting access on this doc in case you’d like to discuss any areas directly. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find this sort of writeup weird or off-putting, that’s okay – I wish you luck in your search! But if you appreciate that it saves us time and avoids potential future confusion/sadness, read on! \r\n\r\n\r\n(The topics written below are unlikely to change, but I am open to huge flexibility within their lines and to clarification when unclear or indeterminate. If any specific questions come to mind, please ask them :) \r\n\r\n\r\n“One summer, Julian skillfully navigated his way to a caribou roast at a cabin mere miles from the arctic circle. I was his plus one and will be telling this story until the end of time. Not for our journey in a rental car to this small Alaskan bush town with no cell service, not for the epic love story of the lovely couple who hosted us, but in awe of how my friend Julian’s generosity, authenticity, and curiosity in others lead to the moment where we stopped in the road, locked eyes with a caribou, and realized how magnificent the world is.” \r\n-Emily, a dear friend. [Editor’s note: I believe it was actually a moose.]  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhy do I call him “Tiny”? Because he’s my newt! \r\nAt a glance: \r\n* 31 years old\r\n* 6’0”\r\n* Born & raised near San Francisco, CA\r\n* Culturally Jewish but not religious\r\n* Reasonably fit & athletic\r\n* B.A. in Philosophy from Yale \r\n* Autistic & nonbinary (and does relationships sapphically) \r\n\r\n\r\nCore values:\r\n* Curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness (which include adventure, exploration, and experience)\r\n* Humor & fun\r\n* Honesty \r\n* Kindness and helpfulness (not to be confused with niceness)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Julian is a very cool and unique person and I can confirm they are not like Amber Heard or anything traumatic/yikesy/holy-shit-what-was-that-esque and are safe to date. No weird surprises or court cases with this one! 10/10, (would not date again though of course because we were wrong for each other, but figuring that out was easy breezy lemon treesy, plus I have since met the person I’m going to marry and do recommend that experience and think everyone should try it, 5 stars, and I enthusiastically hope Julian finds their life partner too, as they are a mega dope human and they deserve a happy ending, goddamnit!)”\r\n-Jane, a former partner who is lovely and kind and who clearly wrote this while following the Amber Heard / Johnny Depp trial \r\n\r\n\r\n“Julian is intensity. If you love flavor, color, texture, vibrancy, feeling, you’ll love Julian. If you’re not sure, his playful teaching style will get you to love it all and him. If you’re looking for bland or generic, he may not be for you. But if you try anyway, you’ll probably end up better than you started.”\r\n- Nikki, a former partner\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCurrent Funcle seeking promotion to Fun Parent. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For (in no particular order)\r\n1. A primary life partner. I would like to commit to putting a single relationship above all others. I would like my partner to be fundamentally interested in doing the same with me.\r\n2. Openness to exploration and creativity. This interest is both cultural (eg I spent the first 4 months of 2023 traveling through Australia and Asia, and 3 months recently in Europe) and social (I love meeting new people). I thrive more than most people when I feel free; I suffer more than most people when I feel trapped. To that end, I’m interested in forming a relationship that is fundamentally tailored to our individual needs (rather than one that fits some standard archetype). \r\n3. If I have kids, I would like to spend much of my time focused on them. I have thusfar built a life that would enable me to follow this passion, and I would like a partnership that enables me to do the same. \r\n   1. I. Love. Kids. I like acting like a kid, I like playing with kids, I like being around kids. I like the feeling of holding a child; it’s more absorbing than any other feeling in the world. (Note: While I’m not in a rush (as finding the right partner is more important than speed), I would enjoy having kids soon :) \r\n4. I enjoy caring and giving. I love the feeling of really, truly, deeply caring about someone – I’ve experienced it once romantically before and I would like to again, both with my partner and with my children. I would also like my partner to have a similar/parallel emotional experience about me. \r\n5. I want a partner who I experience as kind and generous and accepting. I have many uncommon traits that I would like to be appreciated/valued/loved. These traits include: \r\n   1. Autism – medically diagnosed; had a big impact on my childhood; these days many people I meet wouldn’t even guess but it’s still meaningful\r\n   2. Transness (which includes taking estrogen (more on this below). \r\n   3. Being a wandering soul – I’ve lived in a van for 5 years, changing city a few times per year. \r\n      1. Re this traveling topic, I would like to find a partner who either A) also enjoys living in new places, or B) joins on some adventures while otherwise living in a place that I find sufficiently satisfying that they can serve as a “home base” as I explore. (I love NYC. I lived in Manhattan for 6 months of 2022 and 6 months of 2023. I would enjoy being a “super snowbird”.) \r\n\r\n\r\n“I was still relatively new to stand up [comedy], and took encouragement to my heart. Julian offered to come and then take me out to steak dinner after a show, and Julian, a man of his words, followed through. After the show we walked around the corner to where his van was parked, where he then proceeded to cook me a steak himself on a campfire burner, handed me a plastic fork and paper plate, and said that he’d give me a knife but his dog Smidgen had licked all of them. It was one of the best steaks I’ve ever had.” \r\n* Matan, a kid from the youth group I used to mentor. [Editor’s note: I believe some of Matan’s details to be apocryphal but left the story unedited to let the love shine through.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTraits I have that I find attractive (attempting to be accurate and clear rather than show humility)\r\n* Intelligence and a unique perspective\r\n   * Most people who talk with me find me one of the most interesting conversationalists they know.\r\n   * I have been told that I am very much myself. If you like my perspective on the world, you're likely to love it because it's so amplified. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Humor\r\n   * I enjoy jokes, teasing, and funny art. My favorite painting is a portrait of a pig. I couldn’t stop laughing. The piece recently moved to Pennsylvania and I’d love to see it again.\r\n   * If I tease you or riff with you, it’s intended affectionately. People have different styles (and New Yorkers are often very literal). If you have a different style, no worries – I enjoy open communication here. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Intensity, competitiveness and drive\r\n   * I’m a competitive person. I’m generally very skilled at card games, board games, and sports. I’ve also applied this strategic skill to succeed in many areas of my professional and social life.\r\n   * I find properly-placed aggression and intensity to be incredibly sexy. I’ve received the feedback that I’m particularly skilled in bed; this is not mere happenstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Direct communication & a high degree of honesty\r\n   * I rarely lie – certainly much less than nearly everyone. I’m also much more precise with my words than nearly everyone.\r\n   * In a comfortable container, I can be both logically precise and profoundly emotionally vulnerable. If this tickles your fancy, we’re going to have a good time.\r\n\r\n\r\n* A high amount of self-knowledge and the ability to self-malleate when needed.\r\n   * I’ve intentionally changed some significant parts of myself. I can do this with a speed that often surprises others. I only do this when it aligns with my values (eg when I find a trait of mine is preventing me from achieving something that I care about more). I like that this ability allows me to grow quickly. \r\n\r\n\r\n“When I first met Julian, I had never heckled a single person in my life, especially not with a megaphone. There I was, a virgin burner swept away in the dust and heat, when he scooped me into his presence. Within minutes, with Julians help, I was screaming ‘hey you with the weird hat, come get some quesadillas!’” \r\n-Geoff, a friend who I met at Burning Man \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy friends sometimes draw me :) \r\nQuestions you may have\r\n1. Are you interested in marriage?\r\n   1. Short answer: yes. Longer answer: I am interested in a primary, committed, preferred-above-all-others life partnership for which the formal contract of marriage fits well. I’m in no rush, however, and am only interested in getting married once. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. How many kids? \r\n   1. I would enjoy having a large family (4+ kids). I am also open to having the standard american size (2-3). \r\n   2. I have previously frozen my sperm and would enjoy having biological children. I am not wedded to this preference but it is a relatively strong one. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. You’re taking estrogen? Why? Are you planning on “transitioning”?  \r\n   1. I began exploring my gender in September 2021 and it dramatically increased my life satisfaction so I started taking estrogen in May 2022. Since then, I have stopped and restarted estrogen on 3 occasions to see whether it is a preferable way of existing for me. It is. By a lot. \r\n   2. I don’t know where this exploration will end up. My current expectation is that it will take me to the femme side of nonbinary. There’s also a chance I will go all the way to transfemale. \r\n      1. I’m learning as I go, realizing an increasingly clear vision of my ideal self, and I’d like to have a partner who enjoys and values this sort of self-exploration. \r\n   3. I have previously dated people who preferred the masculine elements of me and disliked the feminine. This is not a recipe for a thriving relationship. As Daniel Sloss puts it, I’m looking for someone who loves all of me. (If you’re a straight woman looking for a man, look elsewhere!)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What gender(s) do you date?\r\n   1. In general, I find myself attracted to androgynous- or feminine-presenting people. The most accurate one-word description of my sexuality is “lesbian”. \r\n   2. Queer women are a great fit! 10/10, no notes :) \r\n   3. Nonbinary people are also great! (I have less experience dating nonbinary folks than queer women but it’s possible that’s more due to historical pool size around me than actual personal preference.)\r\n   4. Regarding other genders: \r\n      1. Despite gay men frequently finding me attractive (presumably because they see me as queer and a man), this has not historically been a good combination (presumably because they’re wrong about the latter). \r\n      2. I’ve never dated a straight man. I doubt it would work, but maybe? \r\n      3. Straight women have not historically fit well with me, presumably for gender-based reasons. Also, I have found they are more likely to exhibit these traits, both of which I dislike (although of course these are not exhibited by all straight women, which is why I’m not completely nixing the category): \r\n         1. A lack of creativity/queering/outside-the-box thinking. (As a friend put it, “strict heterosexuality is a failure in imagination”.)\r\n         2. Passivity rather than self-reflecting on their preferences and realizing those desires. (As one straight female friend recently realized at age 36: “I’ve spent my whole dating life standing on a street corner waiting for suitors to appear”.) \r\n   5. Many of my habits and preferences (eg around conflict resolution) simply align better with queer culture. This may simply be due to the fact that queer culture is more experimental and closer to the forefront of relationship dynamics, or it may indicate a fundamental queerness in myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Are you monogamous or non-monogamous? \r\n   1. I have dated in monogamous relationships and I have dated in open relationships. I have a slight preference toward open (partially because I don’t like the feeling of trapped-ness), but it is not core to my being. \r\n      1. The most successful relationships I have embodied previously are ones  similar to the structure practiced by most of my gay male friends: one stable primary partnership with large leeway (nearly complete permission?) for external relationships, with the common knowledge understanding that those external relationships will have no detrimental impact on the partnership. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. You live in a van?! Are you… well… poor?  \r\n   1. No. \r\n\r\n\r\n7. This doc is intense! Are you always this intense? \r\n   1. Many of my friends would describe me as lighthearted and fun. (One friend says I’m the funniest person he knows 😇.) That said, when the situation calls for it, I can be very, very intense. Since this doc is a braindump of important topics, it’s designed to be clear rather than beat around the bush, so I guess it’s intense 🤷‍♀️. \r\n   2. If you’re curious what I’m like in real life, let’s grab coffee or a videochat to see if we enjoy talking. In dating as in most areas, if we agree on the general vision of where we’re going (which is what this doc aims to do), I’m not super fussed about the details/timeline and am happy to move at whatever day-to-day pace feels comfortable. \r\n\r\n\r\n8. Why did you write this doc?\r\n   1. I want to ensure I know what I want.\r\n   2. I want to ensure you know what I want. \r\n   3. I want to save time and avoid unnecessary emotional turmoil for both me and others.\r\n   4. I bet it’s a damn good filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Anything else I should know? \r\n   1. That's probably enough for now. If you want to read all of the friend testimonials, you can find them here 😂\r\n\r\n\r\n“Julian invited me to my first burn event. One night, a casual game of foosball evolved into Julian schooling opponents in game while educating them in philosophy, like watching a TED talk if the speaker was presenting from a stolen Miata during a high-speed pursuit by both local and federal authorities. The moment drew a crowd instantly. Julian just shits art wherever he goes. I've never met someone more serious about fun.” \r\n-AJ, a dear friend \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMe & my seester, the day she graduated from business school 😻\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You should have a little reward at the end for anyone who finishes reading this. Like a ‘hey, congratulations, have a cookie’ but a metaphorical cookie.” \r\n-my friend Michał\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, congratulations, have a cookie: 🍪\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me: pitter.patter.precisely@gmail.com"

      "fullText": "﻿Dating me\r\nI guess I’ll do it myself\r\n* I am agentic. I make my life how I want it to be\r\n* I am social. I have 50-100 friends, more than almost anyone I know. I like people, parties and conversation\r\n* I am earnest, trying to make the world better\r\n* I am well-described by ADHD, I am distracted, but I’m trying to improve\r\nStats\r\nAge: 31. Yeah my hair greyed early.\r\nHeight: 6’4” (1.94m).\r\nLocation: London, currently attempting to get a US visa.\r\nJob: I run a web development team of 3.\r\nPoly?: Yes, but my main focus is having a primary partner and I’d try being monogamous for the right person[1]\r\nSexuality: Straightish\r\nWants kids?: Yes\r\nWants to be stay-at-home-parent?: A genuine possibility \r\nWhat I’m looking for: Primarily a long term partner to have kids with (although open to short term things)\r\nWhere to find me online: Twitter - for my sins\r\nPhotos\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\nDistinctive things\r\nGrey hair\r\nYes. It’s grey. It has been since I was 13. I like to see this as a feature - you can experience the social opprobrium of dating an older man, without me being tied down by things like a house or a sports car.\r\nCharisma\r\nI don’t know how one writes about this in a way that doesn’t come across as obnoxious. People say I’m charismatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve hosted like 50 dinners.\r\nI did a rap on a train once.\r\nI started a project that got on wikipedia\r\nBlunt\r\nI’m working on this, but I am blunt and spiky at times. Accuracy is very important to me and I’m frank about money, sex, ambition, feelings. . At times I let this get in the way of being kinder and that's something I'm working on. But if you're somebody who is deeply sensitive, then that might be a large cost to you.\r\nLoquacious\r\nI love to have conversations. I text. A lot. I will definitely call you back first. I may be cycling at the time[2].  Hopefully you’ll find this touching rather than annoying. But if you don’t like being bothered.. \r\n\r\n\r\nI dated someone once who could spend the whole evening in silence. Reader, I did not marry her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I like to talk about:\r\n* Nothing. I like chatting shit. I like blanket statements, pillow talk and complicated wordplay. I like to take dad jokes and push them father. My aim is not to be very funny on average, but to be very funny on aggregate.    \r\n* Feelings. I like to process how I have felt. About conversations and plans. I want to hear how you feel and what you want. I want to know you and be known by you. My sense is that fact is more interesting than fiction and that humans are more interesting when they are less mysterious. I know few people I don’t like and with almost everyone I can find something fascinating.\r\n* Everything. I like talking about policy, effective altruism, forecasting. How to run the country, how to run the dishwasher, how to run away from this strange man who won’t stop talking. It’s all good stuff\r\n* You. If we were to date I would want to make you more like you want to be. I’m pretty intense but if you want to grow, I want to help. I want to help you in your job, your art, your mental health, your relationships with friends and if you want, lovers. \r\n\r\n\r\nI struggle to stay focused on one thing. If you want that. I’m not for you.\r\nFriends and relationships \r\nI used to be an evangelical Christian and in the last few years have got really into effective altruism and forecasting. It’s quite a switcheroo and I have a wide range of friends with a variety of worldviews as a result. I love community - I think and talk about rationalism, EA, neoliberalism, whatever tv show I’m watching.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, I have lots of friends and move in a wide circle of people - I’m often going to parties or visiting Durham for a week etc. etc. I’d love for you to come with me but if that’s not what you want then if it’s a good match in other ways, I imagine we can figure something out\r\n\r\n\r\nMy default would be monogamish/an open relationship but I’m open to discussing. I want to have a life partner but be able to connect with others occasionally. Integrity is really important to me, I'm a flirtatious person by nature, but won't cross any boundaries we set. I don’t want that. I’ll be honest and I’m willing to be flexible, but I also want to be kind to myself. \r\nOther skills\r\n* Good at holding things\r\n* Able to walk across a messy floor without breaking things\r\n* Blood clots fast\r\nWho might be a good fit\r\nSome words that jump to mind\r\n* Curious\r\n* Playful\r\n* Honest\r\n* Intelligent\r\n* Kind\r\n* Patient\r\n* If you like social events.\r\n* If you like dancing\r\nFor balance\r\nI am very biased. Some of my exes had a great time dating me, a couple did not. If you know any of my female friends, feel free to ask them for the details. I don’t want to paint an overly rosy account.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf any of this sounds good, reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr share with a friend. I think I make clear the kind of person who would be a good fit and those who wouldn’t.\r\n\r\n\r\nDM me on twitter or email me at nathanpmyoung@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\nIf something I could change turned you off, I’d appreciate anonymous feedback at https://www.admonymous.co/nathanpmyoung \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a song that feels like dating me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc3Jo65Lct4 \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1]Everyone thinks they are unique and I am no exception. I would like kids and to some extent my poly/monog status is subordinate to that. But I am odd. I don’t think I am well described as a typical monogamous person, because I am spiky with all sorts of preferences. I am willing to negotiate. For more info there is.. another.. blog, which you can ask for by messaging me including the word gubernatorial or like, figuring out how to find it \r\n[2]I have stopped doing this, it was dumb."

I’m seeking someone who values meaningful connections and shares my values of ethical living and personal growth.\r\n* A mix of introverted and extraverted tendencies, I enjoy a balance of socialising and quiet time. I prefer small gatherings or one-on-one conversations over large group discussions\r\n* Vegetarian, I eat 95% vegan, with the occasional vegetarian meal/snack when abroad/visiting\r\n* Somewhat frugal, partly wanting to save money (and perhaps retire early), partly because I value simplicity\r\n* I care about my impact on the world and moral implications of my actions\r\n* My main love language is physical touch and I’m curious about exploring Tantra more\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I do/like\r\n* Go to self-developmental/spiritual workshops/events and embodiment practices like Moving Connections/Contact Improvisation or occasionally ecstatic dance. \r\n* Organise and facilitate meditation groups and retreats\r\n* Learn about psychology and understanding human nature\r\n* Hike in nature; also, everything within an hour I’d call easily walkable 🙂\r\n* I like animals and enjoy pet sitting which I used to do as a side hustle (my main job is analyst)\r\n* I used to travel quite a bit pre-pandemic, however these days I value more building community where I live\r\n* Draw, craft and/or paint portraits of my friend’s pets 🙂\r\n* Read books, both fiction and non-fiction\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I don’t often do\r\n* I’m not much of a foodie - I batch cook and don’t mind eating the same thing for number of days; it is not to say that I don’t enjoy a nice meal, just I usually prefer to spend my time, money and energy on other things\r\n* Sporty things - I enjoy gentle activities like hiking, cycling, and swimming, but I’m more focused on the experience rather than athletic achievement\r\n* I rarely drink alcohol and don’t watch streaming services much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m looking for\r\n* Someone emotionally available and responsible, who values transparency, open communication, and believes that love is both a feeling and a choice\r\n* Spiritual yet grounded\r\n* Playful/compatible sense of humour\r\n* I appreciate partner who is mindful of my ethical choices and would be open not to eat meat and fishes in front of me; I feel the need to disengage emotionally in these situations and I wouldn't want to be disengaged emotionally around my partner\r\nA few caveats\r\n* I’m primarily seeking a long-term connection, but if we get along really well I might be open to short-term too\r\n* Similarly, while I’m primarily looking for monogamy, I’m open to exploring ethical non-monogamy with the right person - someone experienced and responsible in navigating such dynamics\r\n* I’d rather meet in person/have video call to see how we get on than keep texting - but please do share why you think we might be compatible\r\n* I would like to have child(ren), also exploring solo-parenthood path if this is not part of your aspiration\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf this resonates, I’d love to hear from you (perhaps by email at jekot.agnieszka@gmail.com)"

      "fullText": "﻿________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! I’m Meredith. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n* A deeply committed Christian only looking to date other Christians. \r\n* I’m a 36, straight, monogamous woman living in Oakland\r\n* I drink socially; I don’t smoke; I don’t do drugs.\r\n* I’m somewhere between 5ft 6in and 5ft 7in tall.\r\n* I want biological kids, and I am anxious about my timeline. I’m only looking to meet people who want marriage and family too. If for whatever reason I can’t have biological kids, I want to become a foster mom. (I am a carrier for a recessive genetic condition, but I'm open and happy to discuss it—let's chat!)\r\n* Descriptive words: bubbly, passionate, smart, kind, fun, confident, friendly\r\n* Personality: I’ve done a lot of work on self-understanding and personal growth. I’m dependable, collaborative, and extraverted; I’m a people-person who loves helping others. \r\n* Values: Integrity, growth, generosity, lovingkindness, self-ownership. \r\n* Politics: I’m moderate-to-liberal, and I believe curiosity is key to heal the rifts in our society. I’m frustrated by modern politics; I think that Trump is serving only his ego and self-interest, while Democrats currently lack a compelling vision. I enjoy nuanced political discussion, and get my news from diverse print media sources. I'm looking for a partner who prioritizes kindness and respect above complete political agreement.\r\n* Theology: I am a follower of Jesus. My faith is active and central to my life—I prioritize daily prayer, time in Scripture, and putting faith into action through service and generous giving. I value deep theological discussion, but I care much more about having respectful dialog and shared spiritual growth with my partner than complete agreement.* \r\n\r\n\r\nStrengths: I’m the friend in my social circles who makes sure we stay connected by reaching out to get our next event on the calendar. Friends and coworkers often seek me out when they’re facing a problem to get an empathetic ear and a new perspective, to bring clarity out of confusion. I have lots of interesting ideas and I articulate my thoughts well. I get compliments on my go-to potluck food: deviled eggs. At my best, I light up the room with infectious enthusiasm and joy. (Someone actually wrote that about me in a 360 feedback a few years ago, and it still gives me warm fuzzies!) \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lifestyle: \r\n* I prioritize getting sleep, staying active, and eating healthy food. My bedtime is 9:30-10pm so I can wake up in time for quiet time and exercise before my commute. I like to get fresh produce at the local farmer’s market that I cook up to have leftovers all week. My current goal is to run 3 times a week; I’d like to improve my running speed. I’ve run 2 10k races, and now I’d like to focus on my time before adding more distance. (I’d like to get to a 10min/mile pace.) I also really enjoy dance workout classes. \r\n* I love spending time with kids. I adore my niece and nephew (10 and 8); my niece flew out all by herself over the summer for a few days, and it was such a delight to have her visit. I try to see them in person 2-3 times a year. I volunteer with a girl in foster care (7) through the CASA program, and she brings so much joy to my life. On our outings, we go to playgrounds; get icecream; paint our nails; go swimming; read books; and more. I’m close friends with a local family with two girls (10 and 6) who are like additional nieces to me. Additionally, I’ve taught Sunday school for multiple years, and I’ve also done science mentoring and outreach with kids.  \r\n* I’m a big reader; it’s my go-to evening activity. I read a smattering of sci-fi/fantasy, “book of the year” type works, mysteries, women’s lit, and self-help. I recently read “Connecting with Self and Others” and can’t stop talking about it. I’m working through the Bosch murder mystery series currently. I’m a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson as well. \r\n* I host a quarterly game-playing event for the ladies at my church. It’s been a super fun time! My condo has a great shared use community space, which makes it really easy. \r\n* I enjoy going on adventures and trying new things. Examples: hiking / backpacking; seeing theater / musicals; scuba diving; art / craft fairs; kayaking; glass flameworking and other arts classes (love The Crucible!); cooking classes; and travel.  \r\n* I’ve loved classical guitar since I first heard it played as a kid, and during COVID, I finally bought a nylon-string guitar. I’ve been teaching myself to play on-and-off since then, and recently have gotten back to playing about 10-15 min each evening. Current level: I can play Christmas carols for my own enjoyment (and you might have to twist my arm to get me to play for you!) \r\n* I have over a 1500 day streak on Duolingo; I’m learning Spanish! I have a group of Spanish speaking colleagues and other learners who also meet monthly and chat in Spanish together; and there are also Spanish speakers at my church. I get a 6-week sabbatical in 2026, and I’d like to go to Mexico (or other Spanish-speaking country) and do an immersive experience to get myself to the next level. \r\n\r\n\r\nProfessionally: Currently, I work as a project manager in Pathology at Genentech. I’ve been in this job for a bit over 5 years, and really enjoy it. Overall, I find a lot of value in enabling high-performing teams to overcome barriers to bring about new treatments for patients. I went to college at Wheaton, IL and I got my PhD in Chemistry at UC Berkeley. \r\n\r\n\r\nDating me would be like: Dancing in the kitchen with an open bottle of wine while our dinner is in the oven. Daily check-ins about your day, how you slept, what’s on your mind. Snuggling on the couch as we watch a movie, read books, or just chat. Going on adventures to explore the city or the surrounding natural beauty. Discussing our thoughts, feelings, reactions, and ideas about current events, politics, church life, and more. Praying together and reading the Bible together. Having a partner in service, generosity, and making the world a better place. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou: I’m looking to build a life with someone who loves Jesus and loves me. I want you to be striving to be your best self; humble in learning from others; earnestly discerning and submitting to God’s will for your life; and confident in who you are and what you want. I want to feel close, connected, and safe with you. Mutual attraction and physical affection are important to me. \r\n\r\n\r\nSend me a note if you’d like to connect! For those who reach out, I’d like to ask that we schedule a brief phone or video call before first. It helps me feel comfortable meeting up!\r\n\r\n\r\n*I really do care about respectful discussion more than agreement; but as I know the following can be deal-breakers, I’d like to be up-front of some of my beliefs on hot-button topics: \r\n* I believe that the Bible in its original language, in the context of the original audience, is fully authoritative. \r\n* I’m egalitarian (I support women in church leadership).\r\n* I think God’s best plan is for chastity outside of heterosexual marriage.\r\n* I believe God used evolution to create the world.\r\n* I believe that the Holy Spirit can continue to work in miraculous ways. \r\nI’m happy to talk about any of these things more, if you’re curious!"

      "fullText": "﻿See my updated date-me doc!\r\nOriginal preserved below, for posterity.\r\n@rmushkatblat / Robert Mushkatblat\r\nEmail: bobert.mushky@gmail.com\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery Short Summary\r\nChild of Soviet Jewish immigrants, software guy, calm.  70% predictable from archetypes.\r\nA Little Less Short\r\nOccupation: lesswrong.com\r\nOrientation: Straight / Monogamous\r\nTraits poorly predicted by archetypes:\r\n* I show up to things on time, don’t miss appointments, and file personal taxes well before the deadline.\r\n* I appreciate fine dining and tea (as artforms, not merely as hedonism, though that’s good too).\r\n* I drink infrequently (maybe 5 times in the last year?).\r\n* I dance (international latin ballroom).\r\nPersonality: Most comfortable in groups of 2 - 6, care a lot about those things that I focus on (ethics and aesthetics both); have sometimes been called a snob (affectionately).  Not a huge fan of super loud events, though I like the occasional prog metal concert.  I like to share my joy in food with friends & partners, and figure out what they like well enough to remove the need for them to exert any sort of mental effort on making decisions in that domain if they want.  (Food is not the only thing, just a good example of how I relate to people.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I’m Looking For\r\nPersonality:\r\nDespite my archetype (high-decoupling nerd male software engineer), most of my closest friendships rest more on personality fit and mutual openness + support, rather than shared careers, interests, or hobbies (excepting rationalism).  Which is to say I spend some time talking about software or x-risk with friends when off the clock, but not most of it.  I probably would not have predicted those particular friendships ahead of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, important components have been:\r\n* Ability and willingness to discriminate between factual disagreements and values differences.  See: high-decoupling.\r\n* At the same time, not being strongly focused on contentious but intractable domains, like mainstream politics\r\n* Having an even temper.  Many other personality traits have been highly variable; e.g. I have quite a bit of practice supporting people through bouts of imposter syndrome.\r\n* Actually deeply giving a shit about something.  I’m not sure if this is causal but it sure has been a common thread.  That something is not always something I personally care about a ton, but it’s generally intelligible to me.  Examples: the flourishing of the local community one grew up in, exploring the limits of communication styles & bandwidth for another…\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialization:\r\nI like small things more than big things.  My tolerance for size increases when I know more of the people.  Quieter is better than louder.  Unstructured is better than structured - I’m not big on board games or movie nights (😬) but do like spontaneously-occurring pockets of discussion.  These are derived from how I’ve felt across many different events, activities, and relationships, and exceptions certainly exist.  Of course, the kind of relationship I expect to be healthy anticipates occasions where we meet halfway and and those were we fly solo, depending on context.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am basically happy to pack my calendar full of socialization, obligations permitting - I’ve yet to run into situations where I was turning down opportunities to socialize because I’d had enough rather than because I didn’t have the time, or because I didn’t expect to enjoy myself doing that particular thing.  However, I wouldn’t feel particularly bereft if I spent a week at home, if I was doing something useful with that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren:\r\nAt least one, and would want to see how the first one goes before deciding on more.  Pessimistic about traditional education, mostly due to personal experience, and would pretty strongly prefer defaulting to homeschooling or thoughtful co-op arrangements.  Ultimately, though, would want to defer to whatever actually worked best for the kid, as the person with the most introspective access relevant to the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance:\r\nI take care of myself reasonably well and happily outsource other things (e.g. house cleaning).  I do have aesthetic preferences about my living spaces but put a pretty heavy penalty on things that add significant overhead in terms of time and attention.  I find doing tasks in this category much easier with another person than doing them alone, but don’t want to over-promise.\r\nInteresting things I’ve done (or have happened to me):\r\n* I wrote the first long-form HP/f!TMR[a][b] fanfic (it’s not actually great, but it is completed)\r\n* Got as far as “finished MVP and launched” with a startup while working full-time\r\n* Have been stung by jellyfish three (3) times and lived to tell the tale\r\n* No longer keep track of how many times someone has said \"this is the best thing I've ever tasted\" or similar after taking them somewhere new\r\n* Speak mother tongue near fluently (русский)\r\n* Flexible[c][d] enough to do things too disturbing impressive to be written down\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies (and how to get to know me):\r\n* Ballroom dance (international latin ballroom, could use a partner)\r\n* Choir\r\n* Tea (currently exploring aged whites)\r\n* Run LA rat meetup (I continue to be semi-active in the Discord server)\r\n* Food (my FTC profile, for my writing in a totally different social context)\r\n* Glowfic\r\n* Used to spend time helping people get better jobs (mostly software)[e]\r\n[a]love you for saying this / admitting that you write fanfic <3\r\n[b]<3  it was a big part of my life!\r\n[c]Do you mean in a literal sense? Either way I'm not sure what you mean\r\n[d]yes :)\r\n[e]how's this working out now?"

      "fullText": "﻿Date me?  \r\n\r\n\r\n* Hello.\r\n* I am David.\r\n* Date me?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything you read here resonates with you or makes you think maybe we should go on a date, message me! There’s a lot of potential upside and very little downside.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to make one of these yourself, here is a template.\r\n\tVital statistics\r\n1. I’m 30 and male.\r\n2. Mainly gynephilic, with some exceptions.\r\n3. I live in London and am pretty settled here.\r\n4. Poly (what's that?) with one partner (Amber) who I live with (her other boyfriend also lives here).\r\n5. Until recently I worked as a software developer; now I’m running a conference on effective altruism\r\n6. I’d like to have children.\r\nWhat I am like\r\n* Cuddly, warm, affectionate\r\n* I have a very calm disposition, low anxiety, low neuroticism, sometimes even a flat affect if tired.\r\n* Sometimes people can’t tell if I’m joking.\r\n* Quite laughy.\r\n* I don’t think of myself as especially intro- or extroverted. I have been known to start chatting to strangers. I don’t do well at massive parties where I know nobody (will bail and go home).\r\n* Often distracted by linguistic curios. (There was a period in my late teens/early twenties when I was distracted by the subject for 3 years.)\r\nThings I like\r\n1. Music. I studied the clarinet here for two years before deciding it wasn’t the life for me. Here is some music I’ve written. I’m working on a new one at the moment. I’m very lucky to have access to a piano at home, it increases my quality of life by a lot. I also sing in choirs and like going to small gigs (often folk).\r\n2. I recently started going bouldering and I think it’s my new favourite thing.\r\n3. Writing silly poems.\r\n4. I’m quite into effective altruism and thinking about ways to increase the impact I have on the world (mainly by donating money, and by volunteering my time as a software developer).\r\n5. Creative writing. Here is a post I’m particularly proud of.\r\n6. I really, really like hugs.\r\n7. Improv games.\r\n8. Reading, particularly science fiction.\r\n9. Camping/hiking/the outdoors.\r\n10. Currently neglected hobbies: dancing, playing board games, drawing.\r\nWhat (I hope) you are like\r\nIf multiple of the below describe you, we should definitely at least chat. Each of them is a strong plus. But these are not essential, strict criteria. Far from it. They're clues. The most important thing is that we like each other and get on well.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou, my ideal person, are probably:\r\n* relatively nerdy,\r\n* like making jokes,\r\n* like to be physically affectionate,\r\n* like playing with ideas,\r\n* hold your opinions lightly,\r\n* are motivated to help others\r\n* and seek new experiences,\r\n* are curious,\r\n* and put in an unusual amount of effort to believe true things (‘good epistemics’). \r\n* In terms of gender presentation, you probably are relatively mixed or neutral. I’m most often attracted to women at the masculine end of the spectrum. Trans folk welcome.\r\n* You enjoy creating things in some way, whether in writing, artistically, or something else.\r\n* There needs to be an intellectual spark. For example, you enjoy talking about abstract ideas, gaining insight about the world, speculating, metacognition, building analogies, and delving into your confusion.\r\nForwardly Asked Questions\r\nWhy make a ‘date me’ page? What even is a ‘date me’ page? Where is your sense of propriety?\r\n* Dating sites are really bad at selecting for the kind of person I might want to date. But ‘real life’ is relatively good at this. I hope that by making this page I make it easier for people I meet in real life to know that I’m open to going on dates, find out about what that might be like, and reach out. This is my way to let people feel empowered to make a move even if it might not work out. I am way too timid about these things myself precisely because I don’t know if telling a friend I like-like them would damage our friendship. It would be tragic to miss out on a great thing because we were both too timid. So this is me giving you permission, and promising not to let it change our friendship.\r\n* Also, all the cool kids are doing it.\r\nWhat are you looking for in your romantic life?\r\n* Love. It’s one of the greatest joys in life and makes the world beautiful.\r\n* While I’m interested in exploring relationships at any level of casualness, I’m most actively seeking something long term, ultimately to be one of the foundations of my life. Ideally, we would eventually live together.\r\n* At the same time, I don't want to fuse with another person; we'd have our own lives, pastimes, interests, and friends/partners.\r\n* I’m not interested in indefinitely-long-distance things.\r\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\n* I’d like to be part of a bustling community of friends who throw parties and regularly cook for each other at each other’s houses and live near each other or together. Hopefully with some casual music-making involved. Willing to move to make this happen. The model could be setting up a group house, or cooperating to live strategically close to our friends.\r\n* Somewhat related to building a community, I’d probably like to start a family. A family is just a tiny, very close-knit community. (Aside: why do people always talk about wanting to start families, but never talk about wanting to finish one?)\r\n* Noticing the passage of time and my desire to start a family is what triggered making this post. I’m also open to the idea of co-parenting with someone without a romantic relationship. We would need to be close friends, of course, to make it a stable partnership. I’m not convinced there is a huge chasm between romance and platonic relationships, as opposed to a spectrum.\r\nWhat face do I have?\r\nThis one (next page). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider this to be a smile - others may say what they wish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto credit: Sally Mears\r\nWe were amused by the gate standing by itself    \r\nWhat is it like dating me?\r\nIt’s hard for me to say from the inside, obviously, but some things you can expect are:\r\n* Attentiveness\r\n* Sincerity\r\n* Cuddles <3\r\n* With serious partners, I like to set aside regular time to talk about how the relationship is going, problem-solve any things that are bugging us, and brainstorm ways we can make the relationship even better than it already is. It really enhances relationships in my experience. Recommended!\r\n* Conflict management:\r\n   * I don't appreciate people with a quick temper.\r\n   * I will want to debrief until we get to the bottom of what’s going on, and make sure we both feel heard.\r\n   * I’m somewhat conflict-avoidant (I seem to not really have a shouty mode), but these days I think I’m quite good at verbalizing when I’m annoyed or angry.\r\n* They noticed my communication skills at work:  \r\nWhat are your thoughts on sex?\r\n   * For me, while I love it, sex is not an essential part of a relationship (especially when one has the possibility of multiple partners, such that something not provided by partner A can be provided by B).\r\n   * That said, I want to be desired, and might not be happy unless you seem somewhat into me physically.\r\n   * I enjoy the process of discovering what we like, and using words quite a lot to guide each other/ask for things. \r\n   * I won't say much about frequency as it varies by person, and over time.\r\n   * I'm not kinky, but to the extent that I am, I'm more subby than dommy.\r\nThings that might be dealbreakers for you\r\n   * I’m quite messy. If you’re neat, we might need to create Inventive Solutions like not living together, hiring a cleaner, or not dating. I pull my weight around the house where agreements are struck, but have low standards by inclination.\r\n   * I’m not very physically fit. If you want a toned body, I can’t provide that. I am trying to live healthily and maintain my current weight (78kg, 5’7”) but I am not and will never be thin.\r\nValues\r\nMy most important values are:\r\n   * Actively try to make the world a better place. Take the well-being of others very seriously, and be willing to take significant personal action to that end. I’ve taken the Giving What We Can pledge to donate 10% of my income to effective charities.\r\n   * Desire to believe true things and let go of cherished but false beliefs. Try to avoid over- (and under-) confidence, deliberately seek out opposing points of view, be open to strange ideas. (‘Good epistemics’.)\r\n   * Integrity: be honest and trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love it if we could bond over some of these values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other, less important values are atheism and veg(eteri)anism. These are only important to me in a partner insofar as I treat them as signs of general factors already mentioned: of taking unfamiliar ideas and others’ welfare seriously. You might embody those in other ways, in which case that's fine.\r\nAesthetics\r\nClothes\r\nI wear them, but I object to dress codes. I like dungarees. I get almost all my t-shirts from boodle at this point.\r\nMusic\r\n   * Musicians who I’ve seen live more than once: Louis Cole/Knower, Daisy Chute, Amanda Palmer.\r\n   * None of those are classical, but classical music (especially of the Romantic era) is the foundation of my taste since my teens, with folk and jazz and alt-pop layered on top. That comes out more in what music I play than what music I consume.\r\n   * All my Spotify likes to 13/11/21, sorted alphanumerically for your pleasure\r\nHumour\r\nSome people really get my humour; other people don’t. The high variance life. But that means when people gel with my sense of humour, they really gel! I’ve had multiple people say to me words to the following effect:  \r\nTODO: Get Holly’s comment framed and put it in pride of place in my room\r\nSo I’m going to keep on with the current humour style. My humour is silly, sometimes dry/deadpan, and quite wordplay-heavy with a good pinch of syntactic ambiguity thrown in too.\r\nFood\r\nFood is nice; I’ll eat it, but it’s not one of my main interests. I spend most of my time being a vegan, for animal abuse reasons, making exceptions when it doesn’t seem worth the expense (e.g. I’m not paying 25p for a cafe to use oat milk instead of cow’s milk). You don’t need to be vegan or vegetarian, as mentioned.\r\nI’ve got to the end of the document. What now?\r\nIf you’ve read this far, we probably have a decent chance of hitting it off, so message me! If not, feel free to share it with someone you think might be interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you found this page via OKCupid, it's a good idea to email me as I check that a lot more often.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re nervous about being direct and we’re Facebook friends, you can use this site to indicate interest, and if it’s mutual we’ll both be notified. But ideally you’ll bite the bullet and reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr if you are less enthusiastic or just want to take a more cautious/experimental approach, maybe just invite me to more things, try to be my friend, and see if we get on in that context!\r\n\r\n\r\nCould I have written this better? Let me know!\r\nFootnotes\r\nPoly?\r\n   * Poly.\r\n   * This means that, by mutual agreement, any of my partners can date anyone.\r\n   * This doesn’t mean you are expected to date anyone I happen to date. It’s just me. I don’t expect my friends to be friends with each other unless they want to be; this is like that.\r\n   * In practice I have one partner, who I’ve been dating since late 2018.\r\n   * Here is a good poly FAQ.\r\n“A shouty mode”?\r\nNot knowing how to be angry by shouting was the reason I gave as a child for not wanting to become a teacher. That was pretty accurate, I was a terrible teacher, unable to control the class."

This is the attitude with which I endeavour to consciously (co-)create ALL my relationships in EVERY context. \r\n\r\nSubstance is less important than essence; that is, there are many ways to love & be loved. \r\n\r\nI am truly, deeply open-minded. I live open-heartedly & I love deeply. It’s who I am & want to be! \r\n\r\nI choose to live & love in this way because I have a lot of love to give & I love sharing it with people. \r\n\r\nI love love. I am in love with Love. I am in love with life itself. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat will always come above any person.\r\n\r\nFeel me. \r\n\r\n\r\n→ If you don't read anything else, read this \r\n→ On a man I dated (& loved instantly!) \r\n→ The poetry of my soul \r\n→ How I came to be who I am [becoming] \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common denominator. \r\n\r\nWhat every man I’ve ever felt deep, instantaneous (magnetic) attraction to has in common: \r\n\r\nThey felt safe to me. \r\n\r\n\r\n“A safe man and a non-threatening man are two different men.” - Dany Rae Arras\r\n\r\n\r\nSome fundamentals: I date men.

To clarify, this is an unequivocal, coquettish “fuck yes”. At least in theory ;)\r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments?
