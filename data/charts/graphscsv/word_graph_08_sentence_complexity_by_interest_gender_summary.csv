We create THREE graphs:

1) Looking for Men:
   Bars for Women vs Men vs NB (all profiles whose interestedIn includes Men)
2) Looking for Women:
   Bars for Women vs Men vs NB (interestedIn includes Women)
3) Looking for Non-binary:
   Bars for Women vs Men vs NB (interestedIn includes NB)

Multi-target rule:
- If someone is looking for multiple genders, they are included in MULTIPLE graphs.

Sentence complexity definition (per profile):
- Split text into sentences
- Tokenize words per sentence
- A "long sentence" is one with word_count > --min_sentence_words (default 20)
- sentence_complex_pct = (long_sentences / total_sentences) * 100

Style:
- For each bar/group, draw a vertical IQR bar (Q1->Q3) with a median line and median label.

Text source:
- profileDetails.fullText (fallbacks included)

"""

Most interesting bar to note: 
Women tended to have higher sentence complexity than men and non binary across all gender interests,
but especifally for women looking for women, where the median sentence complexity was 24.658% (Q1=9.091%, Q3=28.571%),
compared to men looking for women (median=14.194%) and non-binary looking for women (median=18.824%).
