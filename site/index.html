          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This report summarizes patterns found in the Date Me Directory dataset, combining quantitative
            summaries with visualizations and short interpretive writeups.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this analysis as a project for my internship at Valyria Studios. As a data science major, I hoped to understand more about the usage of data science on fields I never considered, such as DateMe documents. This project helped me learn about data scraping, cleaning, and visualization. I hope you learn more about how our language is shaped by more factors than we may have considered.

                <strong>Important Information:</strong><br>
                First, this is a static analysis of a sample of profiles. DateMe Docs are constantly being added and deleted. The data for this project is the 323 accessible profiles that were available in December 2025.<br>
                Second, it does not represent all users in the dataset. This project analyzes a non-random sample of public DateMeDirectory profiles, so findings shouldn't be generalized for the entire dating landscape.<br>
                Third, while this data is public, the users were unaware a college freshman would be analyzing them.
