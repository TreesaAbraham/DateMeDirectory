       <h2>Data Analysis Report</h2>
       <p>This is a literary analysis based on the Date Me Directory dataset. Using 323 profiles and scraping their data, I analyzed how language varies across gender, sexuality, age, and region. Hope you enjoy my findings.</p>

            This report summarizes patterns found in the Date Me Directory dataset, combining quantitative
            summaries with visualizations and short interpretive writeups.

            I started this analysis as a project for my internship at Valyria Studios. As a data science major, I hoped to understand more about the usage of data science on fields I never considered, such as DateMe documents. This project helped me learn about data scraping, cleaning, and visualization. I hope you learn more about how our language is shaped by more factors than we may have considered.

            <li><strong>Important Information:<br></strong> First, This is a static analysis of a sample of profiles. DateMe Docs are constantly being added and deleted. The data for this project is the 323 accessible profiles that were available in December 2025. <br>Second, It does not represent all users in the dataset. This project analyzes a non-random sample of public DateMeDirectory profiles, so findings shouldn't be generalized for the entire dating landscape. <br>Third, while this data is public, the users were unaware a college freshman would be analyzing them.</li>
