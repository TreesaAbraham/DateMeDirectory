- x-axis: word set (bay area style words vs uk/london style words)
- y-axis: prevalence per 10k words
    - if I took 10,000 random words from ALL_US, how many of them would be bay area style words vs uk/london style words
Two bars: bay word set= words most distinctive for bay area and uk word set = words most distinctive for uk/london
- for each bar, show prevalence in ALL_US group vs prevalence in bay area or uk/london group

in order to calculate prevale
nce of bay area style words and uk/london style words in different user groups, we first need to define the word sets for each style based on their distinctiveness in the respective regions. Then, we can analyze the text data from users in the ALL_US, BAY_AREA, and UK_LONDON groups to count occurrences of these words and compute their prevalence per 10,000 words. Finally, we can visualize the results using a bar graph and output the data to a CSV file for further analysis.
we took the most distinctive words from bay area vs non-bay area (from word_graph_04) to define bay area style words, and the most distinctive words from uk/london vs non-uk/london (from word_graph_04) to define uk/london style words. Then we calculated how often these words appear in the text of users from ALL_US, BAY_AREA, and UK_LONDON groups to determine their prevalence per 10,000 words.
We did the same for UK/LONDON style words, using the distinctive words identified from the UK/LONDON vs non-UK/LONDON comparison.

Then through script 9, we calculated the prevalence of these word sets in the text data from users in the ALL_US, BAY_AREA, and UK_LONDON groups. The results show that bay area style words are more prevalent in bay area profiles, while uk/london style words are more prevalent in uk/london profiles, confirming the distinct linguistic characteristics of these regions.
