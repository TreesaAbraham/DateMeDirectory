# Graph 09 — Bay Area + UK wordset prevalence (vs All US)

This graph compares wordset rates per 10k tokens across groups (All US, Bay Area, UK/London), focusing on the prevalence of SF/Bay-area wordset terms and UK/London wordset terms.

Interpretation goals:
- Check whether Bay Area profiles show higher Bay-wordset rates than other groups (expected)
- Check whether UK/London profiles show higher UK-wordset rates than other groups (expected)
- Compare cross-over effects (e.g., Bay profiles using UK wordset terms)

Notes:
- Token counts and group sizes matter. Small groups are noisier.
- Wordset selection determines everything. If the wordset is biased, the chart will faithfully reflect the bias.
