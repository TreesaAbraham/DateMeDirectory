# Graph 08 — Sentence complexity by “interested in” gender

This graph analyzes sentence complexity, grouped by the gender the profile author is interested in. The goal is to see whether sentence structure (short/simple vs longer/more complex) varies across the “interested in” categories.

## What the chart shows
- Sentence complexity compared across three groups:
  - interested in men
  - interested in women
  - interested in non-binary people
- Whether one group tends to write longer/more structurally complex sentences.

## Why this matters
Sentence complexity can reflect how people choose to present themselves:
- detailed narrative bios vs quick punchy bios,
- formal tone vs casual tone,
- whether the bio is designed to “explain” vs “vibe.”

## Caveats
- Complexity can be distorted by punctuation habits, emojis, and formatting.
- Longer bios naturally tend to produce more complex sentences.
- This is descriptive of the dataset, not a claim about any group universally.
