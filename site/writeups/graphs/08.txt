Split text into sentences → split_sentences(text) uses regex to break on ., !, ?, and newlines
Count words per sentence → sentence_word_count(sentence) tokenizes using the WORD_RE pattern
Identify long sentences → Counts sentences where word_count > min_sentence_words (default: 20 words)
Calculate percentage → (long_sentences / total_sentences) * 100
Key gotcha: The threshold is strictly greater than (>), not >=. So a 20-word sentence with --min_sentence_words=20 is not considered complex.

The script runs this calculation per profile, then aggregates results by (target_gender, source_gender) pairs to generate the IQR statistics in your CSV.

Across all genders interested in women always had higher sentence complexity than men and non-binary users.
Most notablly, for female looking for femaile, the percentage of complex sentences is much higher (median: 25.965) compared to other groups.
This indicates a noticealble difference in writing style or communication approach
It's also interesting to notices that the range for sentence complext (26-13% is wider and greater than the range for word complexty
