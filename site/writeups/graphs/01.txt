This graph visualizes the prevalence of “serious relationship” language in the dataset using a mosaic-style summary.

What to look for:
- Which terms cluster together
- Whether the “serious relationship” vocabulary appears concentrated or broadly distributed
- Whether any language looks unusually overrepresented (possible sampling or prompt effects)

Notes:
- This is descriptive: it reflects the dataset, not the population.
- Profiles vary a lot in length, so rare-but-long profiles can distort how “common” language feels.
