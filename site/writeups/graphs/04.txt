This graph compares vocabulary that is more distinctive in US profiles versus non-US profiles. The goal is to identify words that appear disproportionately in one group relative to the other, which can surface differences in cultural references, spelling conventions, and lifestyle cues.

What the chart shows
- Words that are “more distinctive” for US profiles.
- Words that are “more distinctive” for non-US profiles.
- The magnitude of distinctiveness (how strongly a word separates the groups).

Interpretation
Distinctive terms often come from:
- place names and regional references,
- spelling differences (e.g., US vs British conventions),
- slang and cultural markers,
- topic differences (jobs, education systems, hobbies).

Caveats
- Distinctive words may reflect demographic composition and interests, not just geography.
- Location may be inconsistently reported or missing.
- Small sample sizes can inflate “distinctiveness” for rare words.
