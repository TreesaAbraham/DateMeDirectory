To calculate the most distinctive words for us vs non-us users, we analyzed the text data from user profiles in both groups. We counted the occurrences of each word in the profiles and computed their z-scores to determine how distinctive they are for each group. The words with the highest positive z-scores in the US group are considered most distinctive for US users, while those with the highest negative z-scores in the non-US group are considered most distinctive for non-US users. This analysis helps us understand the linguistic differences between users from these regions.

1. Data Input & Classification

Reads user profiles from profiles_master.json
Uses the location field to classify each user as "US" or "NON_US" via a heuristic classifier that looks for:
Explicit markers: "USA", "United States", ZIP codes
US state abbreviations and names (e.g., "SC", "California")
Non-US country hints (e.g., "London", "Canada")
2. Text Extraction & Tokenization

Extracts profile text (tries multiple fallback fields like fullText, full_text, etc.)
Tokenizes into words using regex: [a-zA-Z']+ (letters + apostrophes)
Filters out:
Words shorter than 6 letters (configurable)
100+ common English stopwords ("the", "and", "people", etc.)
3. Statistical Scoring
Counts occurrences of each word in US and NON_US profiles
Calculates z-scores for each word using:
Positive z-scores → distinctive for US users
Negative z-scores → distinctive for non-US users
The prior acts as a smoothing mechanism to avoid overweighting rare words
4. Output Generation

Creates a side-by-side table visualization (PNG + SVG)
Exports CSV with rankings, word counts, and z-scores
Top 20 words per column (configurable via --top_n)
Key Gotchas & Design Choices
⚠️ Minimum word length is now 6 letters (changed from implicit default)

This filters out common 1–5 letter noise and focuses on meaningful, content-bearing words
⚠️ Location classification is heuristic-based

Not 100% accurate; relies on pattern matching, not geocoding
Ambiguous locations (e.g., "Europe" without country) get skipped
⚠️ Z-scores, not raw counts

A word appearing 100 times in US profiles might have lower distinctiveness than a word appearing 20 times, if it appears even less in non-US profiles (relative rarity matters)
Sample Output
Your CSV shows words like:

US distinctive: "google" (z=3.73), "business" (z=2.85), "travel" (z=2.82)
Non-US distinctive: "london" (z=-4.20), "listening" (z=-3.15), "interest" (z=-3.05)
This reveals that US profiles emphasize tech/business/leisure, while non-US emphasize place references and interests.

This data matters because it highlights linguistic and thematic differences in how users from different regions present themselves in dating profiles. Understanding these distinctions can inform platform localization, marketing strategies, and user engagement approaches tailored to regional preferences and cultural contexts.

it was interesting to see that the most distinctive words for US users were related to technology and business (e.g., "google", "business", "technology"), while non-US users had more location-specific and interest-related words (e.g., "london", "listening", "interest"). This suggests that US users may focus more on professional and tech-savvy identities, whereas non-US users might emphasize their interests and locations more prominently in their profiles.
This may also indicate what users from different regions prioritize when presenting themselves on dating platforms, which can be valuable for tailoring user experiences and marketing strategies.
