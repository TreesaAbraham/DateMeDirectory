# Graph 06 — Em dash usage patterns

This graph looks at em dash usage across profiles. Em dashes are a punctuation choice that often correlates with a particular writing style (informal, conversational, or “stream of thought”), so measuring their frequency can give a lightweight signal about tone.

## What the chart shows
Depending on renderer/version, you may see:
- em dash frequency per profile, or
- bucketed counts showing how many profiles fall into low vs high usage.

## How to interpret it
Higher em dash rates can reflect:
- more narrative-style bios,
- more sentence fragments or asides,
- greater use of conversational voice.

Lower em dash rates can reflect:
- shorter bios,
- more bullet-style writing,
- more formal punctuation preferences.

## Caveats
- Some users use hyphens (`-`) instead of em dashes (`—`), which may undercount “em dash style.”
- Length matters: longer profiles have more opportunities to use punctuation.
- This is a stylistic marker, not a personality diagnosis (unfortunately).
