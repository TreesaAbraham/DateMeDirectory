There are several graphs calculating word complexity based on who the user was looking for.
There were 9 categories:
- Female looking for  Female
- Female looking for Male
- Female looking for Non-Binary

- Male looking for  Female
- Male looking for Male
- Male looking for Non-Binary

- Non-Binary looking for Female
- Non-Binary looking for Male
- Non-Binary looking for Non-Binary

The data above represents individual user records with the following fields:
- User ID
- Gender
- Looking For
- Number of Words Used
- Average Word Complexity
Using this data, please generate a summary of average word complexity for each of the nine categories listed above.
To calculate the average word complexity for each of the nine categories based on the provided user data, we can follow these steps:
1. Initialize a dictionary to hold the total word complexity and count of users for each category.
2. Iterate through each user record, extract the relevant fields, and update the totals and counts in the dictionary based

We then built sepearate graphs for each category using the calculated averages. on the user's on the extracted data.
We made sure the graphs were based on the gender the person was looking for. 

While all fields had similar word complexity percentage (around 12-15%), we observed some variations
Regardless of which gender the user was looking for women always had at least 1% word complextity compared to millenial
This could indicate that wommen may be using more complex language when searching for partners compared to men in order to seem more sophisticated or appealing.
That or they just read a lot more novels (aka smut, this is for you Lorenzo). And know how to use big words.
