# Represents: Exclamation mark usage per 100k words by generation with outliers indicated
# Outliers: Points outside 1.5*IQR from Q1 and Q3
# Generations: Gen Z (born 1997-2012), Millennial (born 1981-1996), Gen X (born 1965-1980), Boomer (born 1946-1964)
# Min word count: 100 (minimum words in profile to be included)
# Min exclam count: 1 (minimum exclamation marks in profile to be included)
# Age calculated based on birth year as of 2025
# Why this data matters: Analyzing exclamation mark usage can provide insights into communication styles and emotional expressiveness across different generations. Higher usage may indicate a more enthusiastic or informal tone in profiles, which could influence perceptions in online dating contexts.
Based on the data collected, we can observe variations in exclamation mark usage across different generations.
Notably, Gen Z appear to have a higher frequency of exclamation mark usage per 100k words compared to other generations, suggesting a more expressive communication style. This trend may reflect generational differences in online communication preferences and social norms. Understanding these patterns can help tailor communication strategies for dating platforms to better engage users from different age groups.
Also note that boomers have the lowest exclamation mark usage, which may indicate a more reserved or formal communication style compared to younger generations. (it could also be because there are fewer boomers on the platform overall, leading to less data)
This information is valuable for dating platforms aiming to enhance user experience by aligning communication styles with generational preferences.


This data analyzes the number of exclamation points per 100k words by generation (gen z, millenial, gen x, boomer) and age. It includes user IDs, ages, birth years, generations, total words written, total exclamation points used, and calculated exclamation points per 100k words.
This data includes any outliers that were outside (Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR))
Although Gen Z still had the most exclamation points per 100k words on average, Millenials had more higher end outliers than Gen Z. (5 from 1500-2000, 3 from 2000-2500, 2 from 2500-3000, 1 from 3000-3500, 1 from 3500-4000)
This graph supplements the main analysis by showing that while Gen Z uses more exclamation points on average, Millenials have a larger number of high-usage outliers. This suggests that while Gen Z may generally be more expressive in their writing, there are Millenials who are exceptionally expressive, potentially indicating different communication styles or contexts of use between the generations.
