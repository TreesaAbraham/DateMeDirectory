# Graph 02 — Exclamation points per 100k words (by generation)

This data analyzes the number of exclamation points per 100k words by generation (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Boomer) and age. It includes user IDs, ages, birth years, generations, total words written, total exclamation points used, and calculated exclamation points per 100k words.

This data includes any outliers that were outside (Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR).

Although Gen Z still had the most exclamation points per 100k words on average, Millennials had more higher-end outliers than Gen Z:
- 5 from 1500–2000
- 3 from 2000–2500
- 2 from 2500–3000
- 1 from 3000–3500
- 1 from 3500–4000

This graph supplements the main analysis by showing that while Gen Z uses more exclamation points on average, Millennials have a larger number of high-usage outliers. This suggests that while Gen Z may generally be more expressive in their writing, there are Millennials who are exceptionally expressive, potentially indicating different communication styles or contexts of use between the generations.
