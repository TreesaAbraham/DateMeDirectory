This graph compares region-linked language by highlighting words that appear more distinctive in SF Bay Area profiles versus UK/London profiles.

What to look for:
- Words that “feel” location-coded (slang, place names, cultural references)
- Whether one region shows more distinctive vocabulary than the other
- Whether differences look like topic differences (jobs, hobbies, lifestyle) rather than purely regional language

Caveats:
- Region labels depend on what users self-report.
- Distinctive words can reflect demographic composition and interests, not just geography.
