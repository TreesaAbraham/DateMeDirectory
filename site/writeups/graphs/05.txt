In order to calculate the prevalence of bay area style words and uk/london style words in different user groups, we first need to define the word sets for each style based on their distinctiveness in the respective regions. Then, we can analyze the text data from users in the ALL_US, BAY_AREA, and UK_LONDON groups to count occurrences of these words and compute their prevalence per 10,000 words. Finally, we can visualize the results using a bar graph and output the data to a CSV file for further analysis.
We took the most distinctive words from bay area vs non-bay area (from word_graph_04) to define bay area style words, and the most distinctive words from uk/london vs non-uk/london (from word_graph_04) to define uk/london style words. Then we calculated how often these words appear in the text of users from ALL_US, BAY_AREA, and UK_LONDON groups to determine their prevalence per 10,000 words.
We did the same for UK/LONDON style words, using the distinctive words identified from the UK
Then, we created a bar graph to visualize the prevalence of both bay area style words and uk/london style words across the three user groups. The x-axis represents the user groups (ALL_US, BAY_AREA, UK_LONDON), while the y-axis shows the prevalence per 10,000 words. Each group has two bars: one for bay area style words and another for uk/london style words. This visualization helps to compare how frequently these distinctive words are used by different user groups.
Finally, we saved the calculated prevalence data into a CSV file named "word_style_prevalence.csv" for further analysis and reference. This file contains columns for user group, bay area style word prevalence, and uk/london style word prevalence./london vs non-uk/london comparison.
