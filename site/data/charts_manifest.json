      "key_findings": [

        "For profiles looking for women (target=F), Women have the highest median long-sentence rate at 25.965% (n=14), compared to Men at 14.629% (n=206) and NB at 18.919% (n=3).",

        "Compared to the ALL_US baseline (Bay=262.74; UK=261.36 per 10k), Bay Area profiles over-index on Bay-wordset terms (370.29) but not on UK-wordset terms (257.83).",
